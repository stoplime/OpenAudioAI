global warming is not a crisis %$* 79
. i want to introduce to you, robert rosenkranz, chairman of the rosenkranz foundation, the sponsor of this evening’s debate, who will make some opening remarks. %$* 45
thank you, brian, and, and welcome to all of you. %$* 1
i’m robert rosenkranz, chairman of intelligence squared, which is an initiative of the rosenkranz foundation. %$* 1
with me tonight is dana wolfe, the executive producer of this, series of debates. %$* 1
i see a number of, uh, a lot of familiar faces in the audience but also a lot of newcomers. %$* 1
so let me just say a word about why we’re, we’re doing this. %$* 1
it’s really with the intention of raising the level of public discourse in this country. %$* 1
it comes from a feeling that, uh, political conversations are just too rancorous and that, this nation could benefit from a forum for reasoned discussion of, key policy issues. %$* 1
the topic tonight is, is one that, uh, has attracted an enormous amount of, of interest. %$* 1
the proposition: global warming is not a crisis. %$* 1
and the, panelists are going to try to persuade you to vote for or against the motion. %$* 1
uh, ultimately your votes will decide which side has carried the day. %$* 1
uh, well, why this particular, topic? %$* 1
senator barbara boxer, al gore have assured us that on this particular topic the debate is over. %$* 1
well, we took that as throwing down the gauntlet and i personally am cynical enough to think that perhaps there’s a distinction between science and political science. %$* 1
um, and maybe a side that feels like there is nothing to debate, might feel that there are perhaps some inconvenient truths on the other side that they would prefer not to deal with. %$* 1
i’m old enough to remember when there was a, uh, scientific consensus on global cooling, and this was in the 1970s with all kinds of alarmist data on that subject. %$* 1
i’m enough of a businessman to know that the modeling and the use of the computer, uh, algorithms and forecasting the future is a very, very difficult undertaking. %$* 1
i mean, if one could predict, uh, the weather or patterns of storms even a year in advance it would be worth billions and billions of dollars to people engaged in energy trading or, uh, or, insurance underwriting and a whole bunch of other pursuits. %$* 1
and yet it can’t really be effectively done. %$* 1
so tonight’s debate, i think, is addressing issues that for me are very real and, which, at intelligence squared we feel can use some serious enlightenment. %$* 1
uh, first of all, on the science of it. %$* 1
does science really have the, the ability to tell us with, with a good degree of reliability what is going to happen to our climate over a hundred year period? %$* 1
and secondly, the economics. %$* 1
um, this all leads in effect to public policies that say, we should invest, money now for benefits in the future. %$* 1
well, that always poses the traditional questions of, well, what are the costs? %$* 1
what are the benefits? %$* 1
what are the alternatives? %$* 1
what are the risks of action? %$* 1
what are the risks of inaction? %$* 1
so there are a whole welter of economic aspects that i think, hopefully tonight we’re going to get some enlightenment on as well. %$* 1
uh, this evening, of course, is a live event but it will reach an audience through national public radio of over fifty radio stations around the country. %$* 1
we’re produced for radio by by wnyc in new york. %$* 1
and it’s now time for me to turn the, uh, proceedings over to brian lehrer, who is the award winning host of, wnyc’s new york public radio call in program, the brian lehrer show. %$* 1
this has been called new york city’s most thoughtful and informative talk show by time magazine. %$* 1
it covers politics and life locally, globally. %$* 1
brian not only holds a master’s degree in journalism but also a master’s in public health and environmental studies. %$* 1
so he is very well equipped to lead these proceedings and to introduce the extraordinary group of panelists who are the real stars of tonight’s event. %$* 1
thank you very much. %$* 1
and, bob, thank you so much. %$* 79
i so personally appreciate your commitment to public discourse at a high level. %$* 79
we need much more of that in this country. %$* 79
i would like to welcome you all formally to the sixth intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 79
let me give you a brief run-down of the evening. %$* 79
first, the proposer of the motion will start by presenting their side of the argument. %$* 79
the opposition will follow. %$* 79
each person will get a maximum of eight minutes and we will go back and forth from one side to the other. %$* 79
second, when all six speakers are finished with their opening remarks i will do some follow-up questioning and open up the floor to brief questions from the audience. %$* 79
and when i say brief, i do mean brief. %$* 79
we have, we are limited to twenty minutes for the entire follow-up discussion after the eight minute presentations. %$* 79
and so i ask that you limit your questions to thirty seconds and not give any speeches tonight and i will do the same in my follow-up questions. %$* 79
uh, third, when the q and a is complete, each debater will make a final statement, not lasting more than two minutes per person. %$* 79
and fourth, during the closing statements, uh, ballot boxes will be passed around for voting. %$* 79
you have your tickets. %$* 79
this is what the ballot box looks like and you will put in either the “for” piece, the “against” piece or the whole ticket if you still don’t know which side you favor. %$* 79
if anyone does not have a ticket ballot – are you snickering at the very idea of being undecided or ambivalent? %$* 79
this is what we’ve come to? %$* 79
um, an usher will get you a ballot at the appropriate moment if you still need one. %$* 79
and fifth, and last, after the final closing statement is made i will announce the results of the audience vote and tell you which side carried the day. %$* 79
now, to introduce the panel. %$* 79
for the motion, author and filmmaker, best known as the author of jurassic park and the creator of e.r., michael crichton. %$* 79
the alfred p.sloan professor of meteorology in the department of earth, atmosphere and planetary sciences at mit, richard s.lindzen. %$* 79
and emeritus professor of biogeography at the university of london, school of oriental and african studies, philip stott. %$* 79
against the motion: climate scientist at the union of concerned scientists, brenda ekwurzel. %$* 79
climate modeler at the nasa goddard institute for space studies, gavin schmidt. %$* 79
and distinguished professor of, uh – i’m sorry. %$* 79
and distinguished professor at scripps institution of oceanography, university of california, san diego – richard c.j.somerville. %$* 79
and that was all very polite. %$* 79
i couldn’t tell how many people voted for or against the motion. %$* 79
all right, first, for the motion: richard lindzen. %$* 79
please go to the microphone. %$* 79
okay, i’d like to thank intelligence squared, the staff, bob rosenkranz, brian lehrer and of course, our worthy opponents, for the opportunity to debate the proposition: global warming is not a crisis. %$* 362
please keep in mind what the proposition is. %$* 362
it is not a debate over whether the earth has been warming over the past century. %$* 362
uh, the earth is always warming or cooling, at least a few tenths of a degree. %$* 362
and we’re talking about, so far, something on the order of six tenths of a degree centigrade. %$* 362
we’re not even arguing about whether greenhouse gas emissions are contributing at some level to warming. %$* 362
and they most certainly should or i would suggest it would be very little. %$* 362
indeed, as far as i can tell, even our opponents do not claim that global warming is a crisis at present. %$* 362
rather, we are primarily addressing the future. %$* 362
now, much of the current alarm, i would suggest, is based on ignorance of what is normal for weather and climate. %$* 362
extreme weather events occur all the time. %$* 362
there’s, there is really no evidence of systematic increases, judging from reports from bodies ranging from the national hurricane center to the u.n.’s inter-governmental panel on climate change. %$* 362
in fact, outside the tropics the theory of such storms and variability says that the variability should decrease in a warmer world. %$* 362
thus, if this is a matter of crisis for where we live the world is in a permanent state of crisis and will be less prone to crisis in a warmer world. %$* 362
sea level has also been a matter of concern, i think largely because it’s very telegenic, as opposed to a half degree of temperature. %$* 362
and sea level has been increasing since the end of the last ice age glaciation, with the most rapid change increase about twelve thousand years ago. %$* 362
in recent centuries the rate has been relatively uniform, averaged over ten year periods. %$* 362
uh, it amounts to a couple of millimeters per year and this is residual of much larger positive and negative changes locally. %$* 362
uh, those changes are due to tectonics. %$* 362
and, and the risk, if you’re worried about sea level change, from these changes is larger than it is from warming. %$* 362
the impact of warming on agriculture is not easy to ascertain. %$* 362
but, for example, india has warmed in the second half of the twentieth century and agricultural output has increased greatly. %$* 362
the impact on disease seems dubious at best, according to articles in lancet. %$* 362
infectious diseases like malaria are not so much a matter of temperature as of poverty and public health, most notably the elimination of ddt.malaria is still endemic in siberia and was once so in michigan. %$* 362
exposure, i would suggest, to cold is generally found to be both more dangerous and less comfortable. %$* 362
now, recently the ipcc summary for policy maker came out and it had an iconic claim about man’s impact on temperature change. %$* 362
uh, does this imply crisis? %$* 362
well, the impact on temperature per unit carbon dioxide actually goes down, not up, with increasing co2.uh, the role of anthropogenic greenhouse gases is not directly related to the emissions rate or even co2 levels, which is what the legislation is hitting on, but rather to the impact of these gases on the greenhouse effect. %$* 362
uh, modelers use double co2 as a convenient benchmark and on the basis of current models, it’s claimed that this should lead to about one and a half to four and a half degrees warming. %$* 362
what is less often noted is in terms of greenhouse forcing we’re already three quarters of the way to that doubling. %$* 362
and we’ve only seen point six degrees. %$* 362
and there’s no reason to suppose, furthermore, that this is all due to man. %$* 362
now, this certainly does not support the model forecasts upon which alarm is based. %$* 362
modelers commonly claim it’s still possible that aerosols have canceled much of the greenhouse warming. %$* 362
unfortunately, the impact of aerosols is considered by the ipcc to be virtually unknown. %$* 362
and indeed, many people consider that canceling the warming involves a larger effect than seems plausible. %$* 362
there have also been claims that warming has been delayed by the ocean. %$* 362
but the results i’ve mentioned are from coupled models involving the atmosphere in the ocean. %$* 362
and in many of these the oceans have been tuned to have particularly long delays. %$* 362
and i think it’s crucial to distinguish between the claim that models can display past behavior from the actual situation, which is that models can be adjusted to display past behavior once that behavior is known. %$* 362
there is no reason to suppose that the adjustment corrected the relevant error. %$* 362
it is worth adding that warming, instead of accelerating, has been essentially absent for about the last ten years. %$* 362
so the iconic statement is itself not indicative of crisis. %$* 362
and one could, if one had time, explain why the iconic statement itself may very well not be true. %$* 362
the major defense of the statement is modelers cannot think of anything else that gave warming over the last thirty years. %$* 362
but these are the same models that cannot account for the medieval warm period, or for that matter, even do a good job of replicating el nino. %$* 362
so even the basis for the iconic statement is not particularly meaningful. %$* 362
so crisis is not a product of current observations. %$* 362
i suggest it’s not even a product of projections. %$* 362
now, there is no reason to suppose that anything will cause a threshold to change this assessment. %$* 362
we’re still talking about a two per cent imbalance and we’re also talking about the impact of co2 per unit co2 that decreases. %$* 362
this is not the usual condition for a threshold. %$* 362
moreover, there are positive reasons to suspect that greenhouse warming is not significant. %$* 362
the real signature of greenhouse warming is not surface temperature but temperature in the middle of the troposphere, about five kilometers. %$* 362
and that is going up even slower than the temperature at the surface. %$* 362
finally, the underlying present concern is not the greenhouse effect, per se. %$* 362
doubling co2 by itself only gives you one degree warming. %$* 362
the-- %$* 362
okay. %$* 362
one. %$* 79
i suggest it’s not even a product of projections. %$* 362
now, there is no reason to suppose that anything will cause a threshold to change this assessment. %$* 362
we’re still talking about a two per cent imbalance and we’re also talking about the impact of co2 per unit co2 that decreases. %$* 362
this is not the usual condition for a threshold. %$* 362
moreover, there are positive reasons to suspect that greenhouse warming is not significant. %$* 362
the real signature of greenhouse warming is not surface temperature but temperature in the middle of the troposphere, about five kilometers. %$* 362
and that is going up even slower than the temperature at the surface. %$* 362
finally, the underlying present concern is not the greenhouse effect, per se. %$* 362
doubling co2 by itself only gives you one degree warming. %$* 362
the-- %$* 362
richard lindzen, thank you very much for your opening statement. %$* 79
okay. %$* 362
i do have to cut you off there. %$* 79
by the way, audience, you may feel free to, to applaud. %$* 79
uh, you can give polite applause, you can give enthusiastic applause. %$* 79
uh, that is your right. %$* 79
of course, we ask that nobody shout anything out. %$* 79
richard somerville, the next statement is yours. %$* 79
the motion before us, global warming is not a crisis, means we ought to know what crisis means. %$* 363
the word does not mean catastrophe or alarmism. %$* 363
it means a crucial or decisive moment, a turning point, a state of affairs in which a decisive change for better or worse is imminent. %$* 363
we are talking about the future here. %$* 363
the entire world now really does have a critical choice to make. %$* 363
it is whether to continue on the present path of adding more and more carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to the atmosphere or whether to find another path. %$* 363
we’re speaking of the future. %$* 363
and science tells us that the path we choose will largely determine what kind of earth our children and grandchildren will inherit. %$* 363
our task tonight is to persuade you that global warming is indeed a crisis in exactly that precise sense so you should vote against the motion. %$* 363
the science community today has impeccable settled science, despite what you have just heard, that demonstrates the reality of global warming and its primary origin in human activities. %$* 363
we fully understand the fundamental physics behind the greenhouse effect. %$* 363
we also now have persuasive observational evidence of dramatic changes already taking place in the climate system, changes that are not in any sense small. %$* 363
mankind’s fingerprints have now clearly emerged above the noise of natural variability. %$* 363
that is the primary message of the intergovernmental panel, climate panel, the panel on climate change report that professor lindzen referred to – the ipcc. we also have powerful tools to prode %$* 363
project many aspects of the future climate with considerable confidence. %$* 363
we take into account other important factors besides greenhouse gases – the sun, volcanoes, pollution particles. %$* 363
some of our forecasts have already come true. %$* 363
a group of people dispute these consensus findings of mainstream scientists. %$* 363
call them contrarians. %$* 363
some are here in this very room. %$* 363
contrarians are not unique to climate. %$* 363
they exist in many fields of science. %$* 363
there are a few retrovirus experts, fully credentialed, who don’t think that hiv causes aids.the new yorker this week, many of you will have seen, writes about them. %$* 363
when the revolution of continental drift was sweeping through geology and geophysics, some imminent earth scientists couldn’t be persuaded that plate tectonics were real. %$* 363
continents can move. %$* 363
these contrarians were mistaken. %$* 363
they faded from the scene. %$* 363
experience, long experience shows that in science it tends to be the rare exception rather than the rule when a lone genius eventually prevails over conventional mainstream scientific thought. %$* 363
an occasional galileo does come along or an einstein. %$* 363
not often. %$* 363
most people who think they’re a galileo are just wrong. %$* 363
we’re talking here about managing risk for the future. %$* 363
it’s a big risk to the planet to bet it on the contrarians. %$* 363
here’s a brief look at some of what we know. %$* 363
the ipc said %$* 363
c said, quote: warming of the climate system is unequivocal, unquote-- %$* 363
based on many kinds of observations. %$* 363
also our knowledge of ancient climates tells us that the warmth of the last half century is unusual in at least the previous three %$* 363
thirteen hundred years. %$* 363
the ipc said %$* 363
c said, most of the observed increase in global av %$* 363
globally averaged temperatures in recent decades is very likely due to the observed increase in human caused greenhouse gas concentrations. %$* 363
these are summary conclusions of, of experts. %$* 363
in a painstaking process, lasting, uh, years with thirty thousand reviewer comments, each log numbered responded to by teams of experts who represent, um, the mainstream science and who take into account views from the fringes as well. %$* 363
there’s never been as thorough and vetted a process for summarizing science precisely for the point of making input to policy makers. %$* 363
nothing said here tonight in a few minutes that we have can possibly undermine, uh, this powerful statement from the scientific community. %$* 363
we also project a further warming of a half a degree fahrenheit for the next twenty-five years. %$* 363
beyond that it does depend largely on how much more co2 and other greenhouse gases humanity dumps into the atmosphere. %$* 363
global warming since the nineteenth century is already more than a degree fahrenheit. %$* 363
it’s continuing. %$* 363
of the twelve warmest years in the instrumental record, uh, eleven of them have occurred in the most recent twelve years globally. %$* 363
2006 was the sixth warmest year in this record globally and the warmest year of all in the u.s.arctic temperatures in the last hundred years increased twice as much as the global average. %$* 363
since 1950 the number of heat waves globally has increased. %$* 363
the heat wave in europe in 2003 that killed more than thirty thousand people was unprecedented in modern times. %$* 363
intense tropical cyclone activity, the ipcc concludes, has increased in the north atlantic region since about 1970.the global ocean, down to a depth of at least six thousand feet, has been warming since the early 1960s. %$* 363
this warming is contributing to sea level rise. %$* 363
it’s by no means all vestiges of the last ice age. %$* 363
sea level rose some seven inches over the twentieth century. %$* 363
the rate of rise has apparently increased recently. %$* 363
water vapor in the atmosphere, as predicted, is increasing as the world warms. %$* 363
this additional water feeds back. %$* 363
it’s a greenhouse gas. %$* 363
it amplifies the warming. %$* 363
it’s as though you had your house wired funny so that when it got warm the thermostat turned on the furnace and made it warmer still. %$* 363
snow cover and mountain glaciers are decreasing markedly. %$* 363
it’s a long list. %$* 363
the list goes on. %$* 363
none of these observational facts is a surprise to the climate science community. %$* 363
they are what we had predicted. %$* 363
we scientists have been expecting measurements like these and now we see them. %$* 363
the question for the future is simply how much worse do we, do we intend? %$* 363
how much more severe, uh, will we let these trends become? %$* 363
the science warns us that continuing to fuel the world using present technology will bring dangerous and possibly surprising climate changes by the end of this century, if not sooner. %$* 363
business as usual implies more heat waves, higher sea levels, disrupted rainfall patterns, vanishing glaciers and much more. %$* 363
limiting carbon dioxide amounts to any reasonable level will take large cuts in emissions. %$* 363
it takes time. %$* 363
we have a giant intra %$* 363
infrastructure based on fossil fuels. %$* 363
to have a meaningful effect by mid-century we need to start soon. %$* 363
the question is really whether humanity has the collective determination to act in any meaningful way. %$* 363
the economic case can be made convincingly, once people understand the cost of doing nothing or too little. %$* 363
it’s like elective surgery. %$* 363
it’s, uh, not free to decline it. %$* 363
technology can accomplish great things once society is committed to such a goal. %$* 363
we know now that humanity has already increased atmospheric carbon dioxide by thirty-five per cent above natural levels. %$* 363
and humanity, as a group, by default or on purpose, will now decide what level it wants to tolerate. %$* 363
then, after humanity has made this decision, how much co2 do you want in your children and grandchildren’s atmosphere? %$* 363
, which – %$* 363
after that, nature will have its say and the climate system will change in response to the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. %$* 363
nature is superbly indifferent to politics and, and spin. %$* 363
but it will have the last word, uh, in this debate. %$* 363
i have a few seconds and i’ll say a few words about the ipcc.i’ve been a coordinating lead author in it, uh, for three years. %$* 363
i’ve, i was in paris last month when this summary was negotiated and released. %$* 363
it’s an extraordinarily impressive international collaboration-- %$* 363
thirty thousand review comments, a hundred and fifty, uh, authors – seventy-five per cent of whom, by the way, were new to the process. %$* 363
we’re not a clique defending what we said six years ago. %$* 363
and i urge you to familiarize yourself with the science because the science here has spoken very plainly. %$* 363
thank you. %$* 363
one. %$* 79
after that, nature will have its say and the climate system will change in response to the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. %$* 363
nature is superbly indifferent to politics and, and spin. %$* 363
but it will have the last word, uh, in this debate. %$* 363
i have a few seconds and i’ll say a few words about the ipcc.i’ve been a coordinating lead author in it, uh, for three years. %$* 363
i’ve, i was in paris last month when this summary was negotiated and released. %$* 363

we’re not a clique defending what we said six years ago. %$* 363
and i urge you to familiarize yourself with the science because the science here has spoken very plainly. %$* 363
thank you. %$* 363
thank you, richard somerville. %$* 79
michael crichton, you have the next statement. %$* 79
the microphone goes up. %$* 364
before i begin i want to just say one brief thing about what richard has just told you. %$* 364
he’s, he’s giving you the story of plate tectonics but it’s fascinating. %$* 364
he’s turned it upside down. %$* 364
he’s turned it on its head. %$* 364
the story of plate tectonics actually is the story of one person who had the right idea – alfred wegener. %$* 364
he had it in 1912.and it is the story of major scientists at harvard and elsewhere opposing him for decade after decade until finally it was proven to be incorrect what they were believing. %$* 364
so it is, in fact-- %$* 364
when i was a kid i was told the continents didn’t move. %$* 364
it is, in fact, perfectly possible for the consensus of scientists to be wrong and it is, in fact, perfectly possible for small numbers of people to be in opposition and they will be ultimately be proven true. %$* 364
i want to address the issue of crisis in a somewhat different way. %$* 364
does it really matter if we have a crisis at all? %$* 364
i mean, haven’t we actually raised temperatures so much that we, as stewards of the planet, have to act? %$* 364
these are the questions that friends of mine ask as they are getting on board their private jets to fly to their second and third homes. %$* 364
and i would like, with their permission, to take the question just a little bit more seriously. %$* 364
i myself, uh, just a few years ago, held the kinds of views that i, uh, expect most of you in this room hold. %$* 364
that’s to say, i had a very conventional view about the environment. %$* 364
i thought it was going to hell. %$* 364
i thought human beings were responsible and i thought we had to do something about it. %$* 364
i hadn’t actually looked at any environmental issues in detail but i have that general view. %$* 364
and so in 2000, when i read an article that suggested that the evidence for global warming might not be quite as firm as people said, i immediately dismissed it. %$* 364
not believe in global warming? %$* 364
that’s ridiculous. %$* 364
how could you have such an idea? %$* 364
are you going to try and tell me that the planet isn’t getting warmer? %$* 364
i know it’s getting warmer. %$* 364
i grew up in long island. %$* 364
and when i was a kid we always had days off from school for hurricanes. %$* 364
there are no hurricanes on long island now. %$* 364
i spent thirty years in california. %$* 364
we used to have something called june gloom. %$* 364
now it’s more like may, june, july, august gloom with september, october, november gloom added in. %$* 364
the weather is very different. %$* 364
however, because i look for trouble, um, i went at a certain point and started looking at the temperature records. %$* 364
and i was very surprised at what i found. %$* 364
the first thing that i discovered, which dick has already told you, is that the increase in temperatures so far over the last hundred years, is on the order of six-tenths of a degree celsius, about a degree fahrenheit. %$* 364
i hadn’t really thought, when we talked about global warming, about how much global warming really was taking place. %$* 364
the second thing i discovered was that everything is a concern about the future and the future is defined by models. %$* 364
the models tell us that human beings are the cause of the warming, that human beings, uh, producing all this co2, are what’s actually driving the climate warming that we’re seeing now. %$* 364
but i was interested to see that the models, as far as i could tell, were not really reliable. %$* 364
that is to say, that past estimates have proven incorrect. %$* 364
uh, in 1988, when james hanson talked to the congress and said that global warming had finally arrived, the new york times published a model result that suggested that in the next hundred years there would be twelve degrees celsius increase. %$* 364
a few years later the increase was estimated to be six degrees, then four degrees. %$* 364
the most recent u.n.estimate is three degrees. %$* 364
will it continue to go down? %$* 364
i expect so. %$* 364
and this left me in a kind of a funny position. %$* 364
but let me first be clear about exactly what i’m saying. %$* 364
is the globe warming? %$* 364
yes. %$* 364
is the greenhouse effect real? %$* 364
yes. %$* 364
is carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, being increased by men? %$* 364
yes. %$* 364
would we expect this warming to have an effect? %$* 364
yes. %$* 364
do human beings in general effect the climate? %$* 364
yes. %$* 364
but none of that answers the core question of whether or not carbon dioxide is the contemporary driver for the warming we’re seeing. %$* 364
and as far as i could tell scientists had, had postulated that but they hadn’t demonstrated it. %$* 364
so i’m kinda stranded here. %$* 364
i’ve got half a degree of warming, models that i don’t think are reliable. %$* 364
and what, how am i going to think about the future? %$* 364
i reasoned in this way: if we’re going to have one degree increase, maybe if, if, climate doesn’t change and if, uh, and if there’s no change in technology – but of course, if you don’t imagine there will be a change in technology in the next hundred years you’re a very unusual person. %$* 364
and i also was aware that we have actually been starting to do exactly the kind of thing that we ought to do, which is to decarbonize. %$* 364
jesse ausubel at rockefeller university points out, for example, that starting about a hundred and fifty years ago, in the time of abraham lincoln and queen victoria, we began to move from wood to coal, from coal to oil, from oil to natural gas and so on. %$* 364
decreasing our carbon, increasing our hydrogen makes perfect sense, makes environmental sense, makes political sense, makes geopolitical sense. %$* 364
and we’ll continue to do it without any legislation, without any, anything forcing us to do it, as nothing forced us to get off horses. %$* 364
well, if this is the situation, i suddenly think about my friends, you know, getting on their private jets. %$* 364
and i think, well, you know, maybe they have the right idea. %$* 364
maybe all that we have to do is mouth a few platitudes, show a good, you know, expression of concern on our faces, buy a prius, drive it around for a while and give it to the maid, attend a few fundraisers and you’re done. %$* 364
because, actually, all anybody really wants to do is talk about it. %$* 364
they don’t actually do anything. %$* 364
and the evidence for that is the number of major leaders in climate who clearly have no intention of changing their lifestyle, reducing their own consumption or getting off private jets themselves. %$* 364
if they’re not willing to do it why should anybody else? %$* 364
is talking enough? %$* 364
i mean, is, is-- %$* 364
the talking cure of the environment, it didn’t work in psychology. %$* 364
it won’t work in the environment either. %$* 364
is that enough to do? %$* 364
i don’t think so. %$* 364
i think it’s totally inadequate. %$* 364
everyday 30,000 people on this planet die of the diseases of poverty. %$* 364
there are, a third of the planet doesn’t have electricity. %$* 364
we have a billion people with no clean water, we have half a billion people going to bed hungry every night. %$* 364
do we care about this? %$* 364
it seems that we don’t. %$* 364
it seems that we would rather look a hundred years into the future than pay attention to what’s going on now. %$* 364
i think that's unacceptable. %$* 364
i think that’s really a disgrace. %$* 364
this doesn’t need to happen. %$* 364
we’re allowing it to happen. %$* 364
and i don’t know what’s wrong with the rich self-centered societies that we live in in the west that we are not paying attention to the conditions of the wider world. %$* 364
and it does seem to me that if we use arguments about the environment to turn our back on the sick and the dying of our shared world, and that's our excuse to ignore them, then we have done a true and terrible thing. %$* 364
and it’s awful, thank you. %$* 364
one. %$* 79
this doesn’t need to happen. %$* 364

and it’s awful, thank you. %$* 364
thank you michael crichton. %$* 79
gavin schmidt, you have the podium next. %$* 79
thank you. %$* 365
i want to talk to you a little about the nature of this public debate. %$* 365
and i want to give you some background to what you’ve been hearing so far, and what you’ll hear a little bit later on. %$* 365
the issue of global warming and whether it’s a crisis or not, is in fact a scientific decision, it’s a scientific issue. %$* 365
it’s not a political one. %$* 365
on the other hand, deciding what to do about it is obviously political. %$* 365
science can inform those decisions, but it can’t determine what decisions society makes. %$* 365
but we’re here to debate the existence of the problem and whether it is a crisis. %$* 365
that's something that the scientists on this side are eminently suited to do. %$* 365
you’ve all seen or heard about the csi police drama, where high tech forensic scientists try and work out who done it when they come across the scene of a crime. %$* 365
well think of climate scientists as csi planet earth, we’re try-, we see a climate change and we try and work out what’s done it. %$* 365
just like on csi we have a range of high tech instruments to give us clues, satellites, ocean probes, radar, a worldwide network of weather stations and sophisticated computer programs to help us make sense of it all. %$* 365
the aim is to come to the most likely explanation of all the facts fully anticipating that in the real world there are always going to be anomalies, there are always going to be uncertainties. %$* 365
conclusions will be preliminary and always open to revision in the light of new evidence. %$* 365
if this all sounds familiar, it’s because it’s exactly the same approach that doctors take when examining a patient. %$* 365
they don’t know everything about the human body, but they can still make a pretty accurate diagnosis of your illness. %$* 365
we end up then with a hierarchy of knowledge. %$* 365
some things that are extremely likely, some things we’re pretty sure of, and some things that we think might be true, but really could go either way. %$* 365
there isn’t a division into things that are completely proven and things which are completely unknown. %$* 365
instead, you have a sliding scale of increasing confidence. %$* 365
let me give you a few examples. %$* 365
we’re highly confident that the sun is gonna rise tomorrow, it might not, it might go nova. %$* 365
but it’s likely that it will happen. %$* 365
it’s quite likely that you’ll be able to get a cab home from this event, unless it’s raining of course. %$* 365
but, but those two things have different levels of certainty. %$* 365
you’re used to the idea that different kinds of knowledge come with different levels of certainty, and that’s exactly what we’re talking about when we talk about the impacts of climate change. %$* 365
going back to being climate detectives, we’re certain that carbon dioxide and methane are greenhouse gases and they’ve increased because of human activity. %$* 365
we’re very confident that the planet has been warming up, and we’re pretty sure that the other things that are going on, changes to the sun, changes to particles in the air, changes to ozone have made some difference but aren’t dominant. %$* 365
the physics tells us that this is a very consistent picture. %$* 365
our suspects, the greenhouse gases, had both the opportunity and the means to cause this climate change and they’re very likely guilty. %$* 365
and they are increasing faster than ever. %$* 365
now, the lawyers get involved. %$* 365
lawyers are paid to present a certain case regardless of its merits and they do that by challenging everything in the case, and if one argument doesn’t work, well, they’ll just move on to the next. %$* 365
this procedure works very well when the proposition being debated is very binary, a yes, no. %$* 365
is the subspe-, is the suspect guilty, uh should he go free, should he go to jail? %$* 365
it is designed specifically to prevent significant action in the face of uncertainty. %$* 365
if there is still reasonable doubt, the suspect gets acquitted even if you still think that they did it. %$* 365
but contrast that with the scientists. %$* 365
they want to know the most likely explanation. %$* 365
the lawyers, they want to win the case. %$* 365
in their own domains both ways of finding out things are very useful, it’s only when they come together in situations like this that things get tricky. %$* 365
particularly when scientific results are perceived to have economic or moral implications, it’s common for political debates to get shifted into the scientific arena. %$* 365
it makes the political argument seem much more scientific and therefore logical. %$* 365
but since the basic disagreement is still political, this is a disaster for any kind of action. %$* 365
so tonight, you’re not gonna hear us arguing about obscure details in climate science, if you have any questions, i have a web site realclimate.org, you can go and check that out and i’ll be happy to answer any questions you might have. %$* 365
but here we’re gonna talk about the bigger picture. %$* 365
let me give you a few examples of how that works. %$* 365
creationists have argued that the eye is too complex to have evolved. %$* 365
not because they care about the evolution of eyes, but because they see the implications of evolution as somehow damaging to their world view. %$* 365
if you demonstrate the evolution of eyes, their world view won’t change, they’ll just move onto something else. %$* 365
another example, when cfcs from aerosol cans and air conditioners were found to be depleting the ozone layer, the ceo of dupont, the main manufacturer argued that because cfcs were heavier than air, they couldn’t possibly get up to the ozone layer. %$* 365
so there was no need to regulate them, that was pure fantasy, but it sounded scientific. %$* 365
again, tobacco companies spent millions trying to show that nicotine delayed the onset of alzheimer’s because that was a distraction from the far more solid case that, that linked tobacco to lung cancer. %$* 365
that was a distraction and a red herring. %$* 365
these arguments are examples of pseudo debates, scientific sounding points that are designed not to fool the experts, but to sow confusion and doubt in the minds of the lay public. %$* 365
this is a deliberate strategy and you’re hearing it here tonight. %$* 365
so during this debate, let’s play a little game. %$* 365
i’ll call it spot the fallacy. %$* 365
every time that you hear the other side claim that we are predicting an imminent catastrophe, give yourself one point. %$* 365
every time you hear an anecdote used to refute a general trend, that’s cherry picking and we heard that already, uh give yourself another. %$* 365
and every time you hear there’s a lag between carbon dioxide and temperature in the ice cores, give yourself two points because that’s a real doosy. %$* 365
so far this evening we’re running at about two red herrings, two complete errors, three straw men and one cherry pick. %$* 365
so see how you do and we’ll compare notes at the end. %$* 365
scientists have to be professional skeptics, right, they are trained not to take new information at face value, they have to ask where measurements come from and what they could possibly mean. %$* 365
they have to be dispassionate about the data, and just see where it leads. %$* 365
once you start making logically fallacious arguments in order to support a predetermined position, you are no longer acting as a scientist, you are acting as a lawyer, however scientific sounding you might seem. %$* 365
despite that natural skepticism, the national academies of all eight, g8 countries, all the major scientific societies, even the white house have agreed with a scientific consensus on this matter, which pointedly did not happen in the 1970s by the way. %$* 365
michael crichton for one has frequently stated the %$* 365
one. %$* 79
so far this evening we’re running at about two red herrings, two complete errors, three straw men and one cherry pick. %$* 365
so see how you do and we’ll compare notes at the end. %$* 365

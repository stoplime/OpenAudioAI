but it is not the case that suicide is simply a self-regarding act. %$* 502
a psychiatrist at massachusetts general hospital, ned cassem, says that when a patient asks about suicide, he begins to ask them, "in whose closet do you intend to leave your skeleton? %$* 502
well, not quite-- %$* 13
the sense that it is interpersonal, right, that this is going to be something that is an act of communication to other people, it says something in that sense, it is always something that impacts other people, and it can't be considered simply a self-regarding act to commit suicide. %$* 502
so, you're saying it's not entirely private, that it also is public-- %$* 13
correct. %$* 502
ways that-- %$* 13
correct. %$* 502
maybe peter singer disagrees with. %$* 13
peter singer. %$* 13
look, i do disagree with it. %$* 467
i mean, there's a sense in which none of us is an island and every act could be seen as having some ramifications socially. %$* 467
but this one is one that i think has very few. %$* 467
and i don't think that the implication that if you end your life somehow you've left a skeleton in the closet, that seems nonsense to me. %$* 467
and, after all, you're making a decision, why wouldn't you say the same to the patient who says, "i don't want any more treatment"? %$* 467
you know, you say patients have the right to refuse treatment, you say that andrew's mother didn't need to have the chemotherapy, but, you know, why wouldn't you say-- %$* 467
why couldn't the doctor say, "look, this could keep you alive, maybe even you'll live for another 23 years, who knows? %$* 467
" like david? %$* 467
you know, you can't exclude it, but you're quite happy to say to people, "you can refuse treatment, you can withdraw burdensome treatment of various kinds-- %$* 467
the doctor can do that, you don't have to accept it," so i don't see really there's such a big difference in terms of the ramifications here of, in both cases, a patient's decision not to do what will prolong their life. %$* 467
okay, well, i mean, this has to get philosophical to some degree. %$* 13
and i want to have you, ilora finlay, take that. %$* 13
so, what is the difference between a patient asking for pills to end his or her life in the last two weeks if it's presumed the last two weeks and asking to be taken off life support in presumed the last two weeks, and dies in both cases? %$* 13
they are actually completely different decisions. %$* 501
the person on life support is in a way being held in that state some-- %$* 501
to someone with disease artificially, but that disease is progressing. %$* 501
what you're talking about here is somebody where their disease may stop progressing, they may actually get much better and improve, but you're making a decision to cut their life off deliberately. %$* 501
and so they're dying of that lethal overdose and they're dying long before they may have died of their disease because you just can't tell. %$* 501
and that's the problem. %$* 501
if you make a decision in life, you must have accurate information. %$* 501
and what i'm saying is, don't kid yourself that information about prognosis is accurate because it isn't. %$* 501
but why doesn't that apply to a decision to withdraws a ventilator. %$* 467
peter singer. %$* 13
i mean, have you never seen a patient where a doctor said, "i think we should take the ventilator away," and the patient actually lived quite a lot longer? %$* 467
that does happen occasionally, yes, but they are dying of their disease. %$* 501
and you shouldn't be giving people treatments that you think are not achieving a benefit because they're futile. %$* 501
so if the person doesn't want to be-- %$* 501
have a treatment, they can refuse it. %$* 501
ventilation is a treatment, and if they decide to refuse it, then they can, and i as a doctor must support them. %$* 501
but that is quite different to me, deliberately assisting their suicide because what happens is then you stop actually actively trying to make the day in front of you better than it would have otherwise been-- %$* 501
andrew-- %$* 13
and even if it's the role %$* 502
let me-- %$* 13
no, let me andrew solomon and then i'll come back to you, daniel. %$* 13
andrew solomon. %$* 13
withdrawal of life support equipment requires a much more active role for the physician than the prescription of medication that someone can use to bring about the end of their own life. %$* 500
it involves the physical removal of equipment. %$* 500
it usually involves the administration of morphine to ease the person through the dying process. %$* 500
there's a great deal that a physician has to do. %$* 500
and this idea that somehow, that it's something that is natural, and because it's natural, it's okay, and the other thing that is somehow unnatural seems very distorted to me. %$* 500
because-- %$* 500
daniel. %$* 13
daniel sulmasy. %$* 13
no, this-- %$* 502
first of all, that's not what we're saying and that's not a reasonable way to defend the distinction between killing and allowing to die. %$* 502
i think one way of putting the difference, from a moral point of view-- %$* 502
at least from our perspective-- %$* 502
is that treatments can be considered and futile and terminated. %$* 502
but patients should not be considered futile and terminated. %$* 502
and that's the difference, intentionally, in the structure of what we're doing, right? %$* 502
so, if somebody's on a ventilator, right? %$* 502
and i stop it, my intention is not that they should be dead. %$* 502
my intention is that they be discontinued from a treatment that i think is needlessly causing suffering, prolonging their dying-- %$* 502
but you don't decide. %$* 18
and i am not-- %$* 502
they decide. %$* 18
i have not-- %$* 502
i have not-- %$* 502
no, they decide whether they go on-- %$* 502
or whether they want to be on it or not. %$* 502
i respect that. %$* 502
but-- %$* 502
but-- %$* 13
but-- %$* 13
but if they haven't died-- %$* 502
but if they haven't died, i don't say, "i failed. %$* 502
please let me go out and get a pillow to smother them, because my intention has been fulfilled when they-- %$* 502
when the treatment has stopped." the paradigm case in this country of terminating life-sustaining treatment is the case of karen ann quinlan. %$* 502
what did people go to court for? %$* 502
they went to court to discontinue her ventilator. %$* 502
and when-- %$* 502
they were surprised-- %$* 502
daniel-- %$* 13
yeah? %$* 502
let me stop you and take 15 seconds to remind people of-- %$* 13
of quinlan’s case in the 1970s. %$* 13
sure. %$* 502
15 seconds. %$* 13
yes. %$* 502
karen ann quinlan was a young woman in a vegetative state on a ventilator after partying and overdosing on drugs. %$* 502
and the courts-- %$* 502
the hospital didn't want to discontinue her ventilator without court justification for that. %$* 502
and what-- %$* 502
the family went to court to do was to say that "we want the right to be able to discontinue our ventilator." and i'm totally supportive of that. %$* 502
and that's what they-- %$* 502
the judge-- %$* 502
the judges decided this is what would happen. %$* 502
and to their surprise, the woman began breathing when she was disconnected. %$* 502
but what they did was to discontinue a treatment that they thought was futile-- %$* 502
okay. %$* 13
let me bring it back to peter singer. %$* 13
so, what i'm hearing your opponent say, to some degree-- %$* 13
and was also made in the opening statement-- %$* 13
is that-- %$* 13
is that we-- %$* 13
death remains beyond-- %$* 13
beyond our understanding, fully. %$* 13
and then dying remains fully beyond our understanding. %$* 13
and your opponents have come up with several examples of cases where individuals would have lived longer. %$* 13
this is just purely the medical, not even the ethical question now-- %$* 13
that we don't really know what we're doing, and that the odds of killing somebody prematurely are out there. %$* 13
look, as andrew said, you can't say that it will never happen. %$* 467
but is it right to condemn a vastly larger number of people to suffer when they don’t want to because there may, you know, in one in several thousand cases, perhaps, be somebody like the david and ilora finlay described? %$* 467
i don't think so. %$* 467
and i would, again, emphasize, i think the case that daniel sulmasy just brought up, with karen quinlan, precisely shows that they are making decisions when they withdraw treatment. %$* 467
she lived another nine years. %$* 467
she never recovered consciousness and she died without recovering consciousness. %$* 467
in my view, that was pretty pointless. %$* 467
but if you believe in intrinsic worth of human life, you shouldn't have seen the ventilator as futile, because the ventilator kept her alive-- %$* 467
was thought to be keeping her alive. %$* 467
and after it was removed, the feeding tubes were keeping her alive. %$* 467
so, was that a good thing? %$* 467
i mean, i don't think it was a good thing, i have to say. %$* 467
but it certainly shows that the decision about withdrawing treatment is just as much a decision that you can get wrong, and you can be dramatically shortening someone's life, as the decision that we're talking about. %$* 467
and let me just add that i have interviewed hundreds of people and heard stories of thousands more who wanted the option to be able to end their lives. %$* 500
and because they had to deal with the system in which what they were doing was illegal, they felt they had to do it while they still had enough vitality and enough self-control to take the lethal medications that they had been able to obtain. %$* 500
and they, over and over and over and over again, die months or sometimes years earlier than they would otherwise be going to die because they're afraid that they will lose that capacity. %$* 500
and my own mother said she could have lived longer if she hadn't been afraid that those intestinal tumors would make it impossible for her to ingest her-- %$* 500
all right. %$* 13
let's let ilora finlay respond. %$* 13
ilora finlay. %$* 13
but, andrew, we're talking about physician-assisted suicide in which the patient has to take the medication and-- %$* 501
or the lethal drugs, i would prefer to call them. %$* 501
and that's what they have to do. %$* 501
so that's not consistent. %$* 501
what you're arguing for is euthanasia. %$* 501
and that's not what we're debating tonight. %$* 501
make the distinction for us. %$* 13
well, in physician-assisted suicide, the doctor prescribes lethal drugs. %$* 501
the patient has to self-administer. %$* 501
and that's the law in oregon. %$* 13
and that's the law in oregon. %$* 501
and they will say, in oregon, well, if you can't do that, then that's too bad. %$* 501
what you're arguing for is that the doctor injects you with lethal drugs because if you can't take them yourself-- %$* 501
i'm arguing no such thing. %$* 500
my question is whether-- %$* 500
but that's what sounded like. %$* 501
the doctor is injecting you. %$* 500
it's a question of whether you'll get into a hospital within which you will not be able to exercise your own volition anymore, because the hospice system can be so controlling and you are so tightly monitored that you lose the capacity to take those drugs. %$* 500
well, why would you have to kill yourself, because you've got a failure with your healthcare system? %$* 501
i would suggest you need to rectify your healthcare system so people can make choices and control. %$* 501
excuse me, but the only way to rectify that aspect of the healthcare system would be to give people the capacity to take those drugs under supervision of the healthcare system, which is precisely what you are opposing. %$* 500
no, absolutely not. %$* 501
ilora, let me just ask you, when you say "your healthcare system," you're saying, "you americans," with your-- %$* 13
i'm afraid i am because i do think that actually in the uk, however much you criticize us, we are not providing the degree of futile overtreatment that people here seem to be frightened of. %$* 501
we don't criticize you. %$* 13
and actually-- %$* 501
actually, we are very careful to have conversations with patients about what they want. %$* 501
and advanced care planning is now becoming a standard part of all care for people who have life-limiting illnesses, in terms of what do they want, where do they want to be, what treatments do they not want and so on. %$* 501
so, those discussions are happening a long time before the situation %$* 501
but you're not denying-- %$* 18
let's let daniel sulmasy come in. %$* 13
no, i'm just sort of concerned by the kind of angry tone that's sort of permeating the panel here. %$* 502
you know, i can certainly see-- %$* 502
honestly-- %$* 13
i can certainly see-- %$* 502
honestly, let me just say, because we-- %$* 13
no, no. %$* 502
don't support anger. %$* 13
i think it's impassioned not anger. %$* 13
yes, yes, yes. %$* 502
it's really-- %$* 502
it's real. %$* 502
it's but it's placed-- %$* 502
no, i'm-- %$* 502
i was going to get to that actually. %$* 502
i think that we sort of want to understand what that comes from, and it comes from, i think, the kinds of failures in healthcare systems and the kinds of problems we have in providing exactly the optimal kind of palliative care that's possible. %$* 502
and, you know, i've had plenty of patients who begin their journey at the end of life with me by asking, you know, you've got-- %$* 502
you're going to give me those pills, aren't you doc? %$* 502
and i tell them, "no, i'm not going to do that. %$* 502
but let's see how things progress in terms of your care. %$* 502
i'm going to be with you. %$* 502
i'm going to care for your pain. %$* 502
i'm going to care for your depression when you're depressed." it is not natural to be depressed when you're dying. %$* 502
you can be sad, but to have a depression with a capital d is something treatable. %$* 502
and as i follow these patients through to the end of their life, the question never comes up again because they're getting the kind of care that people really want, which respects their dignity, which respects their choices and keeps them pain free. %$* 502
and that's what blunts the kind of, sort of righteous-- %$* 502
righteous anger that i think is justified in those cases where that kind of care isn't provided. %$* 502
all right. %$* 13
let's hear from peter singer. %$* 13
yeah, i take it that ilora finlay is not denying that in the uk there are requests for physician-assisted suicide and that indeed there is a movement because you know very well that there is a bill in your own house, the house of lords, which seemed to make some progress just the other day. %$* 467
and it's also true that there are british subjects who have traveled from britain to switzerland in order to end their life because switzerland allows nonresidents, unusually, to have assisted suicide, physician-assisted suicide. %$* 467
so it's clearly the case that it's not just the u.s.system although, you know, i wish we could just snap our fingers and then we would have a wonderful u.s.health system in which nobody needed to end their life. %$* 467
but it's not an easy task, as president obama found out, to reform the u.s.healthcare system. %$* 467
so unfortunately, we're going to have to live and die with the system that we have. %$* 467
but i can't really imagine a system in which-- %$* 467
you know, in the foreseeable future in which there are no serious considered requests for physician-assisted suicide. %$* 467
i'm sorry for interrupting. %$* 13
i want to go to audience questions in just a moment. %$* 13
but before i do, i want to take one more question to ilora finlay, or-- %$* 13
or daniel sulmasy since you're both physicians. %$* 13
part of what i'm hearing from you is that you don't like the fact that your profession is part of the mechanism of this whole thing. %$* 13
and if-- %$* 13
if there - - would you be on this stage at all if doctors weren't involved? %$* 13
if there were some government body or some civilian organization that made these assessments and handed out the pills, and it didn't have anything to do with medicine? %$* 13
i think it's really important that you talk about the assessments and that everyone's quite clear that not everybody who asks is getting. %$* 501
that's already been said. %$* 501
so, it isn't about true choice, if you like, because you're not actually choosing. %$* 501
you're making a request to somebody. %$* 501
i think it would be much safer if doctors weren't the gatekeepers here. %$* 501
were or were not? %$* 13
were not. %$* 501
because i think it would be much safer-- %$* 501
and my argument is about public safety-- %$* 501
that you have to produce a report to an independent body who can look at all kinds of things going on. %$* 501
doctors don't ask you about your personal finances. %$* 501
they're not in the house. %$* 501
they don't have in-depth understanding of the coercive pressures that may be going on at home. %$* 501
but those pressures become important. %$* 501
i have seen families that i thought were loving families, and actually they were hoping somebody would die before the life insurance policy ran out. %$* 501
and the other point that i would like to make in all of that is the doctor needs to be looking after the whole family. %$* 501
and don't forget people have children, they have people who they leave behind. %$* 501
what is it like for a teenager, that his love was not enough to sustain his mother through an illness when he desperately wanted her to keep on living and be part of her suicide? %$* 501
powerful point, and i want to take it to andrew solomon, who is our-- %$* 13
who made our most powerful point this evening. %$* 13
and what's your response to that? %$* 13
well, that's actually been studied in the context of oregon. %$* 500
they've looked at the families of people who have had physician aid in dying and compared them on various psychological measures with families of people who died of natural causes. %$* 500
and what they found is that there is no difference at all except that the people who had relatives who went through physician aid in dying by and large have a greater acceptance of what has happened and have a grieving process in which they feel there is more coherence. %$* 500
that's what the statistics in oregon have shown. %$* 500
all right. %$* 13
i want to go to some audience questions. %$* 13
and here's one thing i want to say. %$* 13
i think that people who have lived through this may have a desire to tell their stories tonight because it's such a powerful thing. %$* 13
and i just want to discourage it, because we have people on stage who are doing that. %$* 13
so, please don't do that. %$* 13
but that doesn't mean if you have a story to tell you that still don't have a question to ask. %$* 13
so, i'm fine with the question part of it. %$* 13
so, i want to go right down here in front. %$* 13
kelly posner from columbia university. %$* 19
so, my question really goes to the to capacity and depression is often a secondary consequence to terminal or chronic illness. %$* 19
and the wish to end one's life is actually a symptom of depression. %$* 19
and there are studies that show that when you treat people who make those requests with antidepressants, they actually withdraw the request. %$* 19
and you, andrew, are one of the greatest proponents of antidepressant treatments that exists, so i was just wondering how you reconcile that? %$* 19
well, i think it's terribly important that people have a psychological assessment. %$* 500
when we proposed this, what we proposed is a highly regulated system. %$* 500
and we have many highly regulated systems. %$* 500
in fact, we have a highly regulated system for making a decision to discontinue life support. %$* 500
we already have a system for people who don't want to go on living and who have a serious illness. %$* 500
that system in which people have to be shown to be competent, in which they have to be assessed not to be suffering from a psychiatric illness, in which, if there is any evidence that they might be, they have to undergo treatment before it's determined whether their decision is a fully rational decision is an appropriate set of measures. %$* 500
but we set regulations like that everywhere. %$* 500
i mean, 92 people a day die in traffic accidents in the united states. %$* 500
we don't say, because people are dying in traffic accidents, we should make cars illegal. %$* 500
we say people shouldn't drive over a certain speed limit. %$* 500
they should pay attention to traffic lights. %$* 500
we set a regulatory system in place. %$* 500
and none of us are arguing in favor of an unregulated activity, and none of us are arguing in favor of helping people to die who have got a depression that could be calls to resolve. %$* 500
would the other side like to respond? %$* 13
yes, because actually the-- %$* 501
ilora finlay. %$* 13
the data from-- %$* 501
the data from oregon itself shows that they are missing those serious depressions. %$* 501
and the oregon system and the washington system don't have a proper monitoring in place. %$* 501
there is no investigation after the death. %$* 501
there is no independent commission. %$* 501
and actually it relies on the doctor being honest enough to report what they've done, but there's no way of picking up if they haven't been. %$* 501
so your regulatory system is actually failing. %$* 501
and in vermont understand that they thought that after three years they wouldn't need to have the safeguards in place anymore because doctors could be trusted, and i was really horrified when i saw that. %$* 501
but we are not wedded to the oregon system or the vermont system without saying that it could be improved. %$* 467
i know that your house of lords just accepted an amendment that there should be judicial review of doctors' decisions. %$* 467
we are certainly welcome to consider those possibilities. %$* 467
we are simply saying that there is a legal system of regulating assisted suicide which is worth implementing. %$* 467
and the problem is that even charlie falconer who’s bill this is said that nothing can be watertight, and that's the problem. %$* 501
if you could come up with a system that was watertight that would be different, but that's not what you've proposed and that's not what we're debating tonight. %$* 501
i'm going to go to another question. %$* 13
sir, over by the wall. %$* 13
i-- %$* 18
just please wait for the microphone to come to you. %$* 13
it's coming down the left hand side. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
and if-- %$* 13
please, can you tell us your name, please. %$* 13
my-- %$* 18
i'm peter strauss this is a question for the opponents. %$* 18
since you've injected the slippery slope argument, could you give me your justification for saying, "it will lead to euthanasia," which is not what any of the statutes in new york call for or would allow? %$* 18
daniel sulmasy. %$* 13
sure, i think that it's simply the logic just-- %$* 502
if the justification, as we've heard, is that people have the right to choose, right, then the next step becomes, "what about that person who is paralyzed and can't actually take the pills? %$* 502
" so, the justification becomes, "well, that's actually discrimination because they actually can't take the pills," so we have to move from assisted suicide to euthanasia. %$* 502
then the next step becomes because the person can't take the-- %$* 502
say that they have the autonomous choice, we can infer that they would and that we would have what's called "non-voluntary euthanasia," not "involuntary" but "non-voluntary" in which we, like we do for withholding/withdrawing life sustaining treatments, say that people who are demented can have the family say that the treatment can be discontinued. %$* 502
and all of this has actually happened in the netherlands already. %$* 502
so, if you want to sort of say that this can't happen, we've moved from a period in the netherlands in which first of all it was legal-- %$* 502
illegal but tolerated, then to being something that was legal for persons who were autonomous and could ask for it, then it's moved on actually to children-- %$* 502
there's a grown again protocol for infanticide of children under the euthanasia law there-- %$* 502
psychiatric indications of people who feel that their psychiatric illness is insufficiently treated can ask for it and get it under those-- %$* 502
all right, daniel, we see where you're going with that, and i want to take it to andrew solomon. %$* 13
he-- %$* 13
well, you just have, you know, painted the staircase of the slippery slope here, and i want to ask andrew solomon-- %$* 13
it sounds-- %$* 13
you know, it sounds real, it sounds concrete, does it concern you? %$* 13
well, i would start by saying that the situation in the netherlands and what's been dealt with in that law is different from what's been dealt with here. %$* 500
but, like peter, i believe that there is room for improvement even in the laws that currently exist. %$* 500
but in oregon we have had 17 years of this law. %$* 500
there has been no evidence of involuntary euthanasia. %$* 500
there has been no evidence of physicians giving people who are disabled injections to terminate their lives. %$* 500
the law is narrow and specific. %$* 500
and it's that narrow and specific law that is in discussion here. %$* 500
we live on a slippery slope. %$* 500
we all live on a slippery slope. %$* 500
there are many practices within our society that, taken to extreme, would be incredibly damaging and detrimental, and we contain them, and we can contain the damage in this and accomplish an enormous, enormous good. %$* 500
ilora finlay, do you feel that oregon is evidence that the slippery slope is not necessarily inevitable? %$* 13
no, not at all, because you've got no way of detecting abuse, and actually if you talk to the campaign organizations in oregon they actually are wanting to campaign eventually for it to just be a pill that you can have without having to see the doctor and go through all that. %$* 501
if you look at the netherlands, they started off having physician assisted suicide and euthanasia. %$* 501
but actually it was more convenient for the doctors because it didn't take so long, so they would go down-- %$* 501
they pushed it down the euthanasia route. %$* 501
that was a-- %$* 501
in-- %$* 501
no, that was just not true, sorry. %$* 467
there was never a case when physician assisted suicide-- %$* 467
peter singer. %$* 13
was legal or accepted and euthanasia was not. %$* 467
but that's-- %$* 467
no, no, they-- %$* 501
they just didn't see that distinction. %$* 467
they didn't see that distinction, but they're now using euthanasia more, and also the-- %$* 501
complications that arose with physician-assisted suicide, because of vomiting, and nausea, and so on. %$* 501
they've gone over to injecting drugs in-- %$* 501
they both have done that. %$* 18
that's really not right. %$* 467
in belgium, they've extended it, so now you have somebody who had euthanasia because he had a botched sex change operation. %$* 501
there's been approval for a prisoner who wants to have euthanasia because he doesn't want to carry on living in prison, and so on. %$* 501
so, it's not a slippery slope down, but it's an incremental extension that we're seeing, where the law can change. %$* 501
ma'am, up there. %$* 13
right in the aisle. %$* 13
folks, if you're upstairs trying to ask questions, i just want to let you know that we don't have mikes up there. %$* 13
but if you come downstairs, i-- %$* 13
for your effort, i'll try to call on you. %$* 13
i'm debra albert first, i think there's a point that can be made for anybody on the panel. %$* 19
i'm sort of in peter's camp when i think about death. %$* 19
i don't think anybody here has ever experienced death. %$* 19
and so, you don't actually know whether or not it is a state that is better than being in excruciating pain all the time. %$* 19
and for those that are opposed, i don't think that you can say that death is not a better choice. %$* 19
but my question actually goes to daniel. %$* 19
when you speak about the societal effect that this can affect other people-- %$* 19
it's not just a personal choice-- %$* 19
i can take a drug and go outside now-- %$* 19
like alcohol-- %$* 19
i-- %$* 13
i-- %$* 13
get into a car-- %$* 19
i need you to-- %$* 13
you had a minute of our time. %$* 13
i need you to-- %$* 13
i'll give you 15 more seconds to nail this. %$* 13
okay. %$* 19
i can take a drug that can affect death on someone's life who doesn't choose to die. %$* 19
and yet, they're not taking alcohol away from me or society. %$* 19
yeah. %$* 502
again, let me first say, in response to the first part of your question, that the excruciating pain that you're talking about is nothing that ilora or i would support that patients have to go through. %$* 502
what we're-- %$* 502
we are totally in support of treating patients' pain, even to the point that it might hasten their death. %$* 502
and so, there's no need-- %$* 502
if people think they need assisted suicide in order to avoid pain, that's not the issue here. %$* 502
that's not even why people in oregon say they're taking the pills, right? %$* 502
it's not because of pain, because we can take care of that, even to the point of rendering somebody to be unconscious. %$* 502
what we're talking about is the kind of world we want to live in, one in which we can say that-- %$* 502
to a person that the fact that you think that you are a burden is sufficient to be able to end your own life, and that we would have an atmosphere in which that kind of judgment could be made by people-- %$* 502
i think is a problematic world to live in. %$* 502
i want to remind you that we are in the question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s. debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan, your moderator, and we have four debaters-- %$* 13
two teams of two-- %$* 13
debating this motion, legalize assisted suicide. %$* 13
right in the center there. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13
you're standing and-- %$* 13
you are the right one. %$* 13
if you can tell us your name, please, when the mic comes to you. %$* 13
hi. %$* 19
i'm misha gupta earlier you argued that life support and taking someone off such ventilation is justified, due to the fact that their illness is progressing. %$* 19
however, many people applying for assisted suicide are in the same position. %$* 19
and i understand there's always exceptions to the rules, in your personal experience –david. %$* 19
what about the candidates whose illness does not turn around and does progress and worsen? %$* 19
what's your justification or reasoning that differentiates the two? %$* 19
okay. %$* 501
thank you for that question. %$* 501
you-- %$* 501
all the patients i look after have got an incurable illness. %$* 501
they all have progressive illness. %$* 501
and they all have illness that is-- %$* 501
working towards their death and they're likely to die from. %$* 501
what i'm saying is that you can't be certain. %$* 501
and i am supporting them while they go through that phase of their lives, helping them reframe their experience, and doing everything i can to improve quality of life. %$* 501
let me tell you one story. %$* 501
a woman who was desperate to be taken off her ventilator, but wanted a lethal overdose-- %$* 501
her husband was very angry that we weren't giving her a lethal overdose. %$* 501
one morning, i persuaded him to go out to the pub for a drink, let me have half an hour in with her, which i did. %$* 501
in that time, i asked her, "what's the worst thing for you at the moment? %$* 501
" and she said it was the whiskers on her chin. %$* 501
and i said to her, "would you like me to give you a quick facial? %$* 501
" now, i've never been trained to do it, but we found some tweezers and one of the nurses came and helped me. %$* 501
and she did indeed have some quite long whiskers on her chin, and we plucked them out. %$* 501
and the nurse said, "do you want to be made up again? %$* 501
"and she said, "yes." we made her up. %$* 501
and her comment was, when we showed her in the mirror, she said, "i feel like a woman again." and from that point on, she never asked for lethal overdoses, but she asked to be made up every day. %$* 501
why? %$* 501
because she realized that she could be a woman again and have personal worth. %$* 501
but my argument is that this motion comes from despair, from seeing that there is no worth left in a human being once they're ill and once they appear to be dying. %$* 501
but you just can't tell. %$* 501
and i want doctors to have to strive to improve quality of life. %$* 501
and that is why i oppose this motion. %$* 501
peter singer. %$* 13
i find it a very sad story, actually, that that was so important to that woman, that sense of being a woman. %$* 467
but-- %$* 467
you've got whiskers on your chin all the time. %$* 501
i'm afraid i would like mine plucked. %$* 501
okay. %$* 467
but-- %$* 467
and i think in a way it's trivializing the reasons why people ask for physician assistance in dying. %$* 467
it's things like being nauseous, feeling breathless, being-- %$* 467
just being able to lie there and not being able to do anything. %$* 467
i mean, it may be that pain can generally be controlled, or i've certainly read palliative care specialists who acknowledge that it can in every case, except as daniel sulmasy just said, by making the patient unconscious. %$* 467
but, you know, that then is getting, i think, very close to what we're talking about. %$* 467
i've seen surveys that say that the majority of american intensive care specialists have used terminal sedation, that is they sedate the patient to the point of unconsciousness. %$* 467
the patient, of course, then does not eat, and they don't tube feed the person, so the patient then dies. %$* 467
i mean, what's the difference between giving the patient so many drugs that they're unconscious and then they're not fed and they die, or allowing them to take a drug which, at their choice and at their time, will end their life? %$* 467
well, your opponents say the answer is intent. %$* 13
and i would just add that-- %$* 500
but i just want peter-- %$* 13
that, before you do, andrew. %$* 13
but i think you have to accept, surely. %$* 467
i mean, it's a fictional notion of intent to say that you intentionally make somebody unconscious knowing that you're not going to feed them and you're unintentionally ending their life? %$* 467
come on. %$* 467
andrew? %$* 13
andrew, you're going to follow quickly so that-- %$* 13
i will quickly. %$* 500
first to say that i think we're all agreed that compassionate medical care is to the good and that anyone who can find meaning in life or can be helped to find meaning in life should be encouraged to do so and receive every possible support. %$* 500
but i-- %$* 500
but i think, in keeping with what peter has just said, that there are a great many people exploring a great many means to bring these ends to their lives. %$* 500
there are people who are shooting themselves in houses by themselves because this is unavailable. %$* 500
there are people who take this medication, someone i interviewed recently was the wife of someone who had managed to get medication and took it and vomited and knew he couldn't get another prescription and had to eat his vomit in order to ensure that he came to an end. %$* 500
there is back alley euthanasia going on in various ways, and it is uncontrolled and unregulated. %$* 500
and if it were legalized, it could be brought more into control. %$* 500
daniel sulmasy. %$* 13
actually, even under legalized assisted suicide, much of what you have described still happens. %$* 502
patients often vomit. %$* 502
in fact, if you read "final exit" from derek humphrey, he suggests putting a plastic bag over your head to make sure that the vomitous doesn't get onto the bed and that you actually suffocate afterwards if the drugs haven't worked. %$* 502
and there are suicides that don't work even under those-- %$* 502
even under those sorts of laws, and there are some even with this that go on outside of that. %$* 502
but i want to go back to peter's-- %$* 502
peter's point about, first of all, you know, again, painting the sort of medical burning lorry case, the person who's in excruciating pain, that's untreated, who's got uncontrollable nausea, et cetera. %$* 502
i mean, these things, in the right hands of palliative care are probably as rare as you would suggest assisted suicide is in oregon right now. %$* 502
these-- %$* 502
we can control most of the symptoms of patients. %$* 502
we don't have to continue life-sustaining treatments on them. %$* 502
they can die, you know, rather quickly. %$* 502
but what i don't want to affirm, again, is that a patient's life is futile. %$* 502
i can say that the treatment is futile, but not the patient themselves and that i would not act with the intention of making them dead. %$* 502
when i give a patient drugs because they have pain at the end of life, and i am sedating them, i'm not sedating them to death. %$* 502
i mean, there may be some people who do that, and that's part of the practice in the netherlands that's also on a continuum with euthanasia. %$* 502
but what i'm doing is acting with the aim of treating their symptoms. %$* 502

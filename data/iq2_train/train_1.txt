it wasn't flowers dropped from 30,000 feet. %$* 141
it was a team of navy seals deployed from a military base in eastern afghanistan who went in and killed him. %$* 141
are we better off for him being dead or not? %$* 141
i think inarguably, we are. %$* 141
psychologically, we are. %$* 141
we're a healthier country because we killed the enemy who wounded us so deeply. %$* 141
i'm sorry i'm not going to sort of play by aaron's rules, because aaron-- %$* 141
i adore aaron, and aaron has realized the hollowness of his proposition. %$* 141
but i came here to debate this motion which is something that-- %$* 141
no, bret, that's unfair. %$* 138
that paul-- %$* 141
that paul is sticking to. %$* 141
actually, bret, i have to say, you can win the debate taking that position, but it's a rather sterile-- %$* 13
sterile position to take in the situation where we're really trying to have a national conversation about this. %$* 13
so i say, resurrect that argument at the end to win. %$* 13
but get into the spirit of really trying to figure out what should we do right now, if you could. %$* 13
and i %$* 141
i take your point that-- %$* 13
okay. %$* 141
i take your point that we phrased it in such a way that it's too absolute for them to win. %$* 13
let me-- %$* 141
you know, aaron said something very interesting somewhere in his talk. %$* 141
he said-- %$* 141
i think towards the end. %$* 141
he said, we have to find some middle ground between the over-ambitions of the freedom agenda, of the bush doctrine, and perhaps the lack of ambition of what was the first five years of the obama presidency. %$* 141
what is the goldilocks formula? %$* 141
that's essentially-- %$* 141
you would agree with me, that's what we're looking to do. %$* 141
and let me make two brief suggestions. %$* 141
one of them is this: the purpose of american foreign policy should not be, particularly in the middle east, should not be to make our dreams come true, because your dreams will never come true when it comes to the middle east, not israel-palestine, not democracy in iraq, not development in afghanistan, not women's rights in saudi arabia, not gay rights in iran and so on. %$* 141
however, we can have an achievable goal of keeping our nightmares at bay. %$* 141
and we can define what those nightmares are. %$* 141
we don't want iran to get a nuclear weapon. %$* 141
we don't want isis to consolidate a caliphate in northern iraq and syria. %$* 141
we don't want the humanitarian disaster of syria to spiral endlessly and affect all of its neighbors. %$* 141
okay. %$* 13
how do we calibrate a foreign policy that keeps our nightmares at bay? %$* 141
that is the question. %$* 141
let's let paul pillar respond. %$* 13
yeah, bret's absolutely right that we can't think in terms of what our dreams are in the middle east. %$* 139
and that's exactly part of what aaron and i are criticizing. %$* 139
again, iraq 2003, the outstanding example, 2003 plus 8 1/2 years, we had a dream, or at least the makers of that war had a dream of using the regime change in this central middle eastern state to stimulate free market economics and democracy, not just in iraq but throughout the region. %$* 139
it was the dream. %$* 139
it wasn't meeting a threat. %$* 139
it was trying to use military force to accomplish a more positive objective. %$* 139
and that's one of the ways we went wrong. %$* 139
you know, meeting real threats, absolutely. %$* 139
and bret gave a couple of excellent examples in his initial presentation, like world war ii.we couldn't agree more. %$* 139
but it's where we've gone beyond meeting threats. %$* 139
paul, what about the example he gave of the yazidi community stuck on the top of a mountain facing genocide? %$* 13
that's not a threat to our national security. %$* 13
was it our business militarily? %$* 13
well, it was a threat to the yazidis. %$* 139
yeah. %$* 13
and i think there are some very tactical decisions that have been very difficult for the administration to make. %$* 139
and we can get really down in the weeds in terms of, you know, hitting this mountain rather than mountain. %$* 139
and i don't think aaron and i are saying, despite the efforts of our worthy opponents to frame the debate in a way that we have to say that every use of military force is for the worst. %$* 139
that's, of course, not what we're saying. %$* 139
aaron? %$* 13
may i just try to frame this-- %$* 138
look, we are stuck in a region we cannot transform, and we cannot extricate ourselves from. %$* 138
we have interests, allies and enemies there. %$* 138
when you cannot transform, and you cannot extricate, that leaves only one course, which is, i would argue, my word, you transact. %$* 138
you essentially apply a cruel and unforgiving standard to what constitutes american national interests, and you willfully pursue those interests. %$* 138
you decide what's doable from what isn't, what is vital from what is discretionary. %$* 138
and when i say, "vital," what do i mean by "vital"? %$* 138
i mean an enterprise in which we are prepared to expend american lives, american treasure and american credibility. %$* 138
that leads you back to the one thing most americans do care about, and that is the protection of the continental united states, which was-- %$* 138
okay, let me-- %$* 13
in effect was the basis for obama's intervention. %$* 138
mike duran. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 140
aaron used a nice phrase in his earlier comments. %$* 140
he said that the middle east was bad-- %$* 140
or, no, was broken, angry and dysfunctional, which i think makes a nice acronym, bad.right. %$* 140
it's a very bad place. %$* 140
and you also say we have interests, allies and enemies there. %$* 140
we-- %$* 140
it's a bad place. %$* 140
we want to keep it as far from us as possible, and yet we can't extricate ourselves. %$* 140
i agree with absolutely-- %$* 140
absolutely all of that. %$* 140
i think we need a metaphor, a kind of different metaphor. %$* 140
and i would say that the middle east is like having diabetes, right? %$* 140
it's miserable, it's horrible. %$* 140
you can't-- %$* 140
you can't get rid of it. %$* 140
you have to-- %$* 140
you have to manage it. %$* 140
and so my argument is that-- %$* 140
that a bias toward action and a bias toward military action is the best way to treat the disease rather than paul's way, which is to-- %$* 140
which is basically to cordon off the area and stay away from it. %$* 140
now, we've already-- %$* 140
as i said earlier, we've already seen-- %$* 140
we tried to cordon it off and move away and ignore it, and it comes to us just like diabetes. %$* 140
i just want to make one point here about the importance of using military force. %$* 140
when - - if we don't show a bias toward action, then we won't have allies. %$* 140
and allies-- %$* 140
this is a counterintuitive thing. %$* 140
we were accustomed, as a result of the kind of rhetoric that we heard from paul, to think that when we use military force, we alienate people. %$* 140
and we want to-- %$* 140
we want to believe-- %$* 140
remember, there was this whole "hard power, soft power" thing. %$* 140
we want to believe that people in the middle east love us for the reasons that we love ourselves. %$* 140
it's not true. %$* 140
why-- %$* 140
the people in the middle east want us primarily for one thing, and that is our ability to provide security and the guarantee that we will provide them security. %$* 140
look at syria today. %$* 140
if we want to solve syria, or if we just want to make it a little bit better and keep it at a distance, we want to put others out in front. %$* 140
we want to have allies. %$* 140
we would like to have turkey, one of the most important countries there, go and do things in syria. %$* 140
let me-- %$* 13
they're not-- %$* 140
if i can just one sentence, all right? %$* 140
yeah. %$* 13
they're not going to go out and take risks in turkey if they think that we might do like president obama did a year ago with syria and say, "ah, you know what? %$* 140
i'm tired of this fight." they need to know we're going to go all the way with them and back them no matter what happens, and that requires military force. %$* 140
paul pillar, very good argument made by your opponents about our credibility and which was put up in opposition to your saying that we make enemies by getting in there. %$* 13
and they're saying, "at least we're keeping allies by going in and showing strength consistently." can you respond to that? %$* 13
yeah, one of the big myths about credibility is that any time we back away from something that's either a losing proposition or not worth the effort or isn't in defense of our key interests, that somehow people and governments all over the world are going to think, "oh, the americans are a bunch of weak-kneed people who aren't going to stand up to their vital interests." that is simply not the case, and there's academic research on this, that it's not the way that other governments think or perceive us. %$* 139
and to understand that, how would we view the russians or the chinese or anyone else who backed away from or did not use military force or flex their muscles in something peripheral, something that was losing, something that was not in their vital interests? %$* 139
would we say, "oh, they're a bunch of weak-kneed lily-livered weaklings, and they're not going to stick up for their vital interests"? %$* 139
of course not. %$* 139
we would assume they would, and that's the same thing with us. %$* 139
bret stephens. %$* 13
look, what paul said is just simply manifestly untrue. %$* 141
i think paul and i would agree that we do not want-- %$* 141
the american government does not want israel to attack iran in the event that iran or the israelis perceive that iran is approaching a nuclear capability, some point of no return. %$* 141
but when we show, when we tell the israelis, when we announce that we have a red line in syria, and then we erase that red line and the president goes before the cameras and says, "oh, i never said, 'red line,' the world had a red line, it was someone else's red line, and, by the way, i have this interesting diplomatic gambit that i've worked out with sergey lavrov,” what does that tell decision makers in jerusalem and in tel aviv? %$* 141
it tells them that america's promise that it will not allow iran to get nuclear weapons is a totally hollow promise that they cannot trust. %$* 141
and you don't have to take my word for it. %$* 141
you can ask the israeli defense minister who is on record as saying this. %$* 141
so we have this issue of credibility that paul has just raised and dismissed-- %$* 141
we have exponentially increased the chance that israel will become a foreign policy freelancer in what is perhaps the most fraught situation in the middle east. %$* 141
why? %$* 141
because they don't trust the americans. %$* 141
same story with the saudis. %$* 141
we used to have a close defense alliance with the saudis. %$* 141
the saudis don't trust us anymore, which is why john kerry had to go on bended knee to riyadh a few weeks ago to say, "no, this time we're actually serious." %$* 141
okay, point made, and i want to take it to aaron david miller. %$* 13
we've spent the-- %$* 138
and, again, i haven't seen a piece of classified information since 2003, so what i'm about to say is my view-- %$* 138
we've spent the last several years trying to preempt the israelis from striking iran prematurely. %$* 138
on the assumption that negotiations and or sanctions, some combination of the two would retard, ultimately undermine iran's pursuit of a nuclear weapons capacity-- %$* 138
forget the weapon itself, just the threshold capacity-- %$* 138
we've make commitments to the israelis based on the assumption that if they stay their hand and iran moves to weaponize, we will do this because we can do it better, we can do it more comprehensively and more definitively. %$* 138
this president may well be called on, bret, to make good on that. %$* 138
and this is an issue for 2015 if these negotiations don't reach an agreement in november, which is highly unlikely in my view. %$* 138
nobody in the middle east believes he'll do that, not a single leader. %$* 140
can you come a little closer to the mike and just say that? %$* 13
sorry. %$* 140
i said nobody in the middle east believes he'll actually do that. %$* 140
he's said it or he's signaled it, suggested it, and so on, but there is nobody, nobody in riyadh nobody in jerusalem, nobody in baghdad, and nobody in tehran believes that he will actually use military force to stop iran. %$* 140
two things would undermine and destroy the obama presidency, what remains of obama's credibility. %$* 138
one is another consequential attack on the homeland-- %$* 138
i'm not talking about a lone wolf inspired attack, i'm talking about directed attack that leads to scores of american casualties, regardless of his actions now-- %$* 138
and the second, which three administrations have now committed themselves to, is iran's crossing the threshold to weaponize-- %$* 138
which is-- %$* 140
and he agrees with you. %$* 140
he agrees with you. %$* 140
and that's why he is caving in the negotiations. %$* 140
and-- %$* 140
well, look, i'm not here to-- %$* 138
and making concession after concession after concession in order to get past the-- %$* 140
in order to hold them at this first-end goal for the next two years. %$* 140
this one may not have a hollywood ending. %$* 138
okay. %$* 13
i want to come to questions in a minute. %$* 13
but i just want to do one more thing before we do that, and i want to look at the counter-claims that were made about the promulgation of and the success of isis in the last year. %$* 13
and the two sides may directly oppose statements based on their theses that inaction caused isis and that intervention caused isis. %$* 13
and i want to maybe split those into two. %$* 13
and first, to go back to paul pillar, your argument that isis is there and successful because the u.s.got into the situation and messed it up. %$* 13
just make that point in about 40 seconds and we'll have your opponents respond to it. %$* 13
there was no such thing as isis or a forerunner of it before we invaded iraq. %$* 139
and once we did and the multi-faceted civil war got rolling, a major ingredient of it was sunni- arab rejection and resistance both to the shiites and to us because we were seen as overthrowing, which we did, a sunni-dominated regime and opening the way to shiite rule, which is exactly what happened. %$* 139
and part of that-- %$* 139
one of the most extreme parts of that resistance to what we did was what was then known as al-qaeda and iraq under mr. %$* 139
zarqawi, which is the group that evolved into what we now know today as isis or islamic state. %$* 139
okay, i want to go to the other side and say that's a coherent statement. %$* 13
before making your case that it was inaction that did that, what's your response to his argument that-- %$* 13
i think it's very simple. %$* 141
isis is the creation of the last five years of inaction. %$* 141
above all-- %$* 141
no, no, no. %$* 13
but that's the part i don't want you to get to. %$* 13
i want you to tell us not what's so good about your argument; what's wrong with his argument? %$* 13
which is not the same discussion. %$* 13
right. %$* 141
and then, i'll come to you. %$* 13
well, the problem with his-- %$* 141
he makes a logical argument that we came in as americans. %$* 13
we picked sides. %$* 13
we took the wrong sides. %$* 13
we fomented onto other side. %$* 13
it's perfectly simple. %$* 141
it's not as if jihadism was born in march of 2003.that's just simply not true. %$* 141
we had jihadi groups all over the middle east. %$* 141
and what we know about jihadism is that the jihadis thrive in areas of chaos, lack of governance. %$* 141
and that's what we've allowed to expand and multiply not simply in iraq, but above all, in syria through a policy of deliberate inaction. %$* 141
so bret, the piece of their argument that, by our being there and stirring the pot, we exacerbating the situation that led to isis, you just reject out of hand? %$* 13
of course we weren't there at the-- %$* 141
we weren't there at all. %$* 141
that's right. %$* 13
we are talking about isis is a creation of the last few years. %$* 141
you had never heard of isis until about two years ago. %$* 141
they changed their name. %$* 13
can i just add one point? %$* 138
isis is a response to two failed and/or failing states and a pool of sunni grievances which mount faster than the numbers of moderate sunni rebels that we can stand up-- %$* 138
grievances generated by assad and grievances generated by maliki. %$* 138
precisely. %$* 18
precisely. %$* 18
you are receiving some that we could fix that? %$* 138
aaron, can you just come closer to your mic-- %$* 13
sure. %$* 138
you're assuming somehow we had the power, the incentive, the motivation after the two longest wars in american history to basically put the syrian humpty dumpty and iraq back together again? %$* 138
that's your assumption? %$* 138
do you think that would-- %$* 138
but aaron, that doesn't answer their point to your point that-- %$* 13
no, but bret-- %$* 138
that how did the americans make isis, let's say, exacerbate the-- %$* 13
to the extent we enabled the weakness of iraq and syria, bret has a point. %$* 138
but i do not believe we bear the primary responsibility for isis' emergence. %$* 138
it was larry summers who said, “in the history of the world, nobody ever washed a rental car.” you know why you don't wash rental cars? %$* 138
because you care only about what you own. %$* 138
and the problem in this region is a lack of ownership. %$* 138
it's a lack of gender equality. %$* 138
it's a lack of transparency, accountability, pluralism, and the emergence of national leaders who care about the vast majority of their people. %$* 138
michael doran. %$* 13
that helped isis-- %$* 138
i just want to point out that that-- %$* 140
you just undermined paul's argument. %$* 140
i thought so, too. %$* 13
because you-- %$* 140
i was having trouble following. %$* 13
no, no, because you said-- %$* 140
you have basically said that it's the bad qualities of this region that are generating these actors-- %$* 140
these malevolent actors rather than our-- %$* 140
rather than anything that we did. %$* 140
and-- %$* 140
to the extent-- %$* 138
yeah. %$* 138
to the extent we enabled it, we deserve a responsibility. %$* 138
look, look. %$* 140
even if you say we're the prime mover, which i don't accept-- %$* 140
but if i accept it for the sake of discussion that we're the prime mover and we set this thing rolling, the only solution to it now is a military solution, and that's the conclusion that president obama came to, and that's the only conclusion that a logical person can come to. %$* 140
paul pillar. %$* 13
bret was absolutely right about radical jihadists capitalizing on chaotic situations. %$* 139
and in this main country we're talking about iraq, we caused the chaos. %$* 139
we overthrew the regime, and we didn't have a plan for what followed. %$* 139
it's iraq and syria. %$* 140
yeah. %$* 18
right? %$* 140
it's iraq and syria. %$* 140
we had nothing to do with syria, nothing. %$* 140
and bret? %$* 13
bret, you may have made the point already in your response to his, but in what way did american inaction lead to the spread of isis? %$* 13
look, it's a matter of record and a matter of fact, which i'm sure at least aaron will agree with, that iraq was at peace in 2009, that al-qaeda was defeated in 2009, through a combination-- %$* 141
this is-- %$* 141
let me explain why-- %$* 141
through a combination of the application of american force which gave confidence to the sunni tribes in anbar province that we were a reliable partner that meant business, that would stick around and that would support them when they-- %$* 141
when we-- %$* 141
when they needed us there. %$* 141
and what did we do? %$* 141
we withdrew, and we withdrew entirely because we wanted to pretend that the middle east didn't exist, that these problems way out there wouldn't come back to haunt us. %$* 141
and that was the fundamental mistake that we made. %$* 141
look, we can – re- litigate the iraq war, and paul would love to re-litigate the iraq war endlessly because he has a winning debate card there. %$* 141
but the issue is not-- %$* 141
i mean, why don't we just simply go back to 1920 or sykes-picot. %$* 141
we could have that debate in 1916 as well. %$* 141
and there's an endless chain of causation here. %$* 141
but the immediate cause of the problems of the jihadi problem is that we allowed iraq and syria to descend into chaos because we believed that the best policy was a policy of inaction. %$* 141
what we are living with now, jihadi movements that have trebled in size in the last four years happened with a president who wanted nation building at home, not abroad. %$* 141
well, that point may be true, but you-- %$* 138
aaron-- %$* 13
aaron, i want to give both-- %$* 13
aaron, i want to give paul a chance to speak because you've had-- %$* 13
our unofficial clock shows you're racking it up, unless, paul, you want to-- %$* 13
unless, paul, you want to yield. %$* 13
but before you do that, i want to say this: this is an intelligence squared u.s.debate where our motion is: flexing america's muscles in the middle east will make things worse. %$* 13
we have two teams of two debating this motion, flexing america's muscles in the middle east will make things worse. %$* 13
on the side arguing for the motion, aaron david miller and paul pillar. %$* 13
on the side against the motion, mike doran and bret stephens. %$* 13
paul pillar. %$* 13
just, iraq, most assuredly, was not at peace in 2009.and we're not going back to sykes- picot or running the causation back deck indicates. %$* 139
we're talking about problems right now, the very issues we're wrestling with right now that are a continuation of what began in the case of iraq, in 2001. %$* 139
let's go to some questions from the audience. %$* 13
sir, right down here. %$* 13
a microphone will be brought to you. %$* 13
and when it does, we'd appreciate it if you could stand, hold the mic about this far away from your mouth as this mic is from mine, about a fist. %$* 13
tell us your name and ask your question. %$* 13
tightly, tightly focused question. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 18
may name is gerry ohrstrom. %$* 18
up till now, much of the discussion has been about the past, yes, the recent past, but still the past, and the good, the bad and the ugly of what happened in iraq, afghanistan, libya and so forth, and a little bit about what caused isis to evolve. %$* 18
my question is, what about where we are right now? %$* 18
what about our attack on isis? %$* 18
what is the good and the bad and the ugly of that? %$* 18
the consequences, outcomes, good or bad. %$* 18
can we win and air attack? %$* 18
do we need boots on the ground? %$* 18
what will the consequences of that be, good and bad and why? %$* 18
will that muscle flexing make things worse? %$* 13
let's put that to aaron david miller. %$* 13
i mean, i think-- %$* 138
aaron, again, on the mic. %$* 13
it's the goldilocks approach, which i happen to support. %$* 138
it's trying to find a balance between risk readiness and risk aversion, an effort-- %$* 138
first of all, we already had boots on the ground, especially operators in iraq. %$* 138
and i suspect, over the next year and a half, that number could double and triple. %$* 138
you should also not be surprised to learn one day that in effect, we already have boots on the ground in syria, and we will have additional boots on the ground, but not the massive redeployment of thousands of american combat forces. %$* 138
that's one red line that will not turn pink with respect to this particular president. %$* 138
the campaign is effective for undermining, retarding, preempting, keeping isis, nusra, khorasan on the defensive. %$* 138
if we hit them repeatedly, they'll have less time to spend planning attacks. %$* 138
but if you asked anybody from the cia today, what is the most imminent threat to the continental united states right now? %$* 138
they won't say, isis.they won't say iran. %$* 138
they'll say aqap. %$* 138
okay, mike doran. %$* 13
al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula. %$* 138
do you know that before, in the green room before we started, aaron came in and said, "i don't think i'm going to use my whole seven minutes." %$* 140
it was a debating tactic. %$* 140
the problem that-- %$* 140
the current campaign will set them back, clearly, and put them on the back seat, but it's impossible to win with this campaign because what we have from baghdad to damascus, baghdad to beirut, is a problem of sunni society. %$* 140
we have a shiite government in iraq, aligned with iran, using horrible murderous sectarian forces on the ground against the sunnis, and we have a shiite government in damascus allied with iran or a non-sunni government in damascus also using horrible, murderous sectarian forces supported by iran. %$* 140
and our air force is coming in and by intention or by accident, is changing the balance of power on the ground in favor of the shiites against the sunnis, which is not going to give us the ability to root out isis. we need to separate the local population sunnis from isis, and we can't do that in this conflicting-- %$* 140
mike, and i want to bring this question back to aaron as well. %$* 13
in terms of our motion, this is a muscle flexing, and you're saying that it's not going to make things better. %$* 13
you're not saying it will make things worse, but you're just not saying it's not going to make things better. %$* 13
we-- %$* 140
there's no-- %$* 140
the president has not defined-- %$* 140
he has not defined victory, and he is on a path that will not achieve victory. %$* 140
and, paul, and risking giving your opponents their point that you might agree with some of their-- %$* 13
sometimes you might think force is called for. %$* 13
in this case, do you think that this muscle flexing is called for, or do you think it will make things worse? %$* 13
well, one difference we've had between the two sides of the stage here, john, is that our opponents keep trying to make this a pro or anti-obama administration thing, but that's definitely not the case. %$* 139
and i think aaron and i both can see pluses and minuses in what's taking place on the isis front. %$* 139
the one substantive point i'd add, john, is that-- %$* 139
is this issue of political will, because ultimately, the fate of this group certainly in iraq, but also in syria, is going to depend on the politics and the capital-- %$* 139
and we've had some encouraging signs in baghdad-- %$* 139
but further political evolution so that iraqi sunnis know that they've got a future in an iraq that is not dominated by isis. %$* 139
that's-- %$* 140
wishful thinking, fantasy, total fantasy. %$* 140
well, we-- %$* 139
mike, actually, i don't want to – %$* 13
we got rid of maliki. %$* 139
that's kind of wandering off our question about what our choices should be, i believe. %$* 13
and so i just want to bring it back to the principle of the debate-- %$* 13
question being asked by the debate, paul. %$* 13
in this case, is the muscle flexing going to make things worse, or is this not one of those cases? %$* 13
i think overall the more deeply we get immersed into sectarian and internal conflicts in either syria or iraq, the greater are all the hazards that we've talked about of making things worse. %$* 139
do you think we're on that-- %$* 13
that does not mean there are not appropriate uses of military force such as rescuing the yazidis on a mountaintop. %$* 139
do you think we're on that path already? %$* 13
i think the path we are on carries much risk of escalation to damaging directions that do make things worse. %$* 139
i'm going to have the other side respond to that. %$* 13
bret stephens. %$* 13
you know, the israelis are great philosophers of middle eastern war diplomacy and overall conduct. %$* 141
and it boils down to a wonderful israeli phrase, "it's depend." %$* 141
oy, thanks god. %$* 18
and it's a wonderful phrase because it depends. %$* 141
it depends on the kind of force the president uses. %$* 141
it depends on whether he's smart about it, whether he listens to his generals, whether his considerations are mainly political or they're mainly strategic, whether he's looking to completely defeat isis, to simply degrade them, how much he's thinking about the view that our allies in the region take of us in our willingness to apply force as well as our-- %$* 141
as well as the way our enemies look at us. %$* 141
michael, i think, came up with a defining metaphor. %$* 141
and this is a good question-- %$* 141
i thought it was a wonderful first question to begin with. %$* 141
we are not going to solve isis. we are not going to solve iraq, and we're certainly not going to solve 1400 years of sunni-- %$* 141
sunni-shia sectarian conflict. %$* 141
what we can try to do is manage this situation so that, a, it inflicts a serious strategic military and psychological blow against isis. %$* 141
b, it creates the possibility for other actors in syria who are real, who exist, who might become more attractive and more popular to a majority of the population that is enchanted neither with assad nor with isis. and we might also demonstrate to our arab allies, to our persian enemies, to our israeli friends that we are a serious player that takes a group or takes something like the rise of isis seriously. %$* 141
okay, i'm just going to take another question. %$* 13
that's the issue, we want to manage. %$* 141
ma'am, you're wearing green. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13
mike's coming on your right hand side, if you could stand up please. %$* 13
my question is for the for side. %$* 19
assuming practicality that the sanctions are now becoming squishy, do you think it's worse to flex american muscle than to allow the middle east to go into a nuclear arms race? %$* 19
i don't know what you mean by sanctions getting squishy. %$* 139
we can argue all night about sanctions. %$* 139
they've worked in some cases and not worked in others, and there are all kinds of variables that take too much time to come into play. %$* 139
but i would mention just one example. %$* 139
and we've cited it in other ways in the past. %$* 139
libya, that was a successful use of sanctions against gaddafi. %$* 139
and he made this tremendous turn away from his previous outrageous behavior with regard to his unconventional weapons programs, weapons of mass destruction, and his rampant involvement in international terrorism. %$* 139
and back in the 1990s, after several years of multilateral sanctions in which he felt both the economic hurt and the political hurt of being a pariah, he changed. %$* 139
he got out of the international terrorism business, and he opened up and gave up his unconventional weapons program. %$* 139
and that was all without use or even the threat of military force. %$* 139
that was a successful case. %$* 139
mike doran. %$* 13
that's a fanciful chronology. %$* 140
he gave up his weapons program after a massive application of american force in 2003.it was the example of the invasion of iraq that turned him. %$* 140
and, by the way, it was also the-- %$* 140
that's factually wrong there. %$* 139
it was also the invasion of iraq that compelled the iranians to stop their weaponization-- %$* 140
i know it is wrong because i was personally involved in the negotiations with the libyans back in 1999-- %$* 139
i was personally involved with the-- %$* 140
four years before that-- %$* 139
i was personally involved with the-- %$* 140
four years before that-- %$* 139
i was personally involved in negotiations-- %$* 140
and that was after-- %$* 139
wait, we've got some real insiders here. %$* 13
mike, will you wait, and, paul, you make your point, and i'll come back to you. %$* 13
bret, bret, bret, bret, bret-- %$* 13
hang on. %$* 13
paul. %$* 13
gaddafi made those decisions in the 1990s. %$* 139
when i sat down across the table from his intelligence chief, he had already decided to get out of the unconventional weapons programs and get out of international terrorism. %$* 139
that was four years before the invasion of iraq. %$* 139
mike doran. %$* 13
his intelligence chief, moussa koussa-- %$* 140
what's his name, great name, yeah, moussa koussa-- %$* 140
moussa koussa once had a beautiful villa overlooking the mediterranean. %$* 140
and he came home one day to his villa and it was turned into rubble, bulldozed into nothing, right? %$* 140
and there was a message for him that, "the leader wants to see you." and so he went to go see the leader. %$* 140
and the leader said, "moussa, that villa." and he said, "yes." he said, "i didn't like it. %$* 140
it wasn't right for you." and he handed him some keys, and he said, "i've built another villa for you, and i want you to have that." and he gave him this other villa. %$* 140
and so what was the message? %$* 140
the message was, "don't get too big for your britches. %$* 140
everything you've got comes from me, everything. %$* 140
and i can destroy you in an instant." that's the mentality of a leader in the middle east, and you've got to ask yourself, "if that's who we're dealing with, do we deal with him with soft power or do we deal with him with hard power? %$* 140
all right, let's go to another question, sir. %$* 13
yes, you're standing up, yep. %$* 13
mike's coming from your left. %$* 13
my question is also for the for side. %$* 18
could you tell us your name, please? %$* 13
i'm alex selkir. %$* 18
i'm a student at princeton university, and thank you for having me here this evening. %$* 18
mr. %$* 18
pillar and mr. %$* 18
miller, your point of only fighting smart wars is well taken. %$* 18
however, military force is not bound to times of war. %$* 18
it is the threat of force, the capability and willingness to use it, from localized strikes to ground invasions that shapes the decision %$* 18
sir, can you just cut to your question? %$* 13
yes-- %$* 18
how can the united states effectively influence the perceptions, calculations, actions, and goals of its adversaries, particularly those who only deal in terms of violence, without a muscular foreign policy? %$* 18
thank you. %$* 18
well, you know, the notions-- %$* 138
can you move in-- %$* 13
the notions that we can have a cookie cutter strategy that is applicable to any number of situations in a region that is so fundamentally complex in my judgment is simply not possible. %$* 138
but he wasn't asking for a cookie cutter-- %$* 13
no, no, no, but you're asking for a sort of rx, a prescription for how to force smaller-- %$* 138
no, he wasn't. %$* 13
he wasn't saying, "what do you do all the time? %$* 13
" i-- %$* 13
honestly i don't think his question was, "in those situations where you are up against a guy who is only going to respond to tough force, how do you get through to him if you're not going to be a hard ass about it? %$* 13
i think that as long as you calculate means and ends, and that, in effect, military power, the projection of it, is an instrument to serve a set of political goals-- %$* 138
then military power can be an effective tool. %$* 138
what do you do, however, in a situation like egypt where, in effect, they are an ally-- %$* 138
former ally-- %$* 138
still our ally. %$* 138
we have a freedom agenda. %$* 138
we want to promote democracy in a country that is, since the overthrow of mubarak, has been dominated by a struggle between the military in one hand and the islamists on the other. %$* 138
we have interests in egypt. %$* 138
we've reduced their military assistance. %$* 138
we haven't threatened sanctions. %$* 138
we have to be artful and relatively sophisticated. %$* 138
but my basic point is, in a region in turmoil, it's simply going to be very difficult create to an action-reaction phenomenon. %$* 138
that's why i go back to the notion of understanding what our core interests are, identifying them, and then trying to protect them. %$* 138
all right. %$* 13
let me go to this side because-- %$* 13
and aaron has made that point a few times about core interests. %$* 13
he's been pretty clear about them. %$* 13
but you had us rescuing yazidis in syria. %$* 13
and we didn't really get very far with the question. %$* 13
i don't want to delve into it too much. %$* 13
but what are our core interests in terms of using force? %$* 13
well, one thing is we don't want to allow genocide to happen against a helpless population of women and children starving and trapped on a mountain. %$* 141
so, that is a core interest. %$* 13
yes. %$* 141
well, that is a core democratic value i would say. %$* 141
and we are a country where values do often go-- %$* 141
let me stop you and ask the other side. %$* 13
is that a core interest? %$* 13
look at our behavior. %$* 138
how can you argue it's a core interest? %$* 138
well, we are incredibly hypocritical when it comes to humanitarian intervention. %$* 138
we decide what is feasible, what is convenient, and we essentially ignore the tough cases. %$* 138
bill clinton, to this day, and the late fouad ajami called him to count. %$* 138
“this is your rwanda, president obama.” %$* 138
so, you're saying-- %$* 13
so, we took a pass. %$* 138
these are not core interests, you're saying. %$* 13
i mean, look. %$* 138
our interests-- %$* 138
i just need it for clarity. %$* 13
i know. %$* 138
you're looking for a short answer. %$* 138
i understand that. %$* 138
no. %$* 13
yes or no isn’t a short-- %$* 13
all right. %$* 138
okay. %$* 138
our interests and our values and our policies are constantly at war with one another. %$* 138
on the issue of genocide, we have not been consistent. %$* 138
not since roosevelt refused to be more ambitious with respect to trying to overcome the military's opposition to bombing the railways to the concentration camps. %$* 138
we have taken a pass on genocide and humanitarian intervention in rwanda, in congo, in syria-- %$* 138
so, mike doran, your opponent is saying that it's not a core interest because we've demonstrated again and again that it's not. %$* 13
and you want to chat to that briefly? %$* 13
and then i want to go to another question while we have time. %$* 13

so-- %$* 352
peter thiel. %$* 13
i actually very much disagree with almost every premise posted in that question but just let me-- %$* 352
let me just-- %$* 352
wow. %$* 13
i'll just flag one. %$* 352
the most concrete skill oriented education people get is engineering degrees, and that is actually probably the one area and we may even agree on this where i think the u.s.does not have an excess of engineers. %$* 352
and but that is something that's specific and tracked and engineering is specific and that's what people get paid for the most. %$* 352
and as we were heading into a more technologically oriented world, that's actually-- %$* 352
there's going to probably be an increasing premium on engineering and on specific types of skills. %$* 352
and if i had to give people advice and they were set on going to college, you should study engineering or some form of engineering unless you are in a really unusual situation and really passionate about something else. %$* 352
so i would sort of quibble with the question on that level. %$* 352
yeah, because i've been wanting to make this point because i think it was charles who-- %$* 353
if i were to reinterpret what he said, he wasn’t against too many kids going to college. %$* 353
he was really against too many kids going to four-year b.a.at expensive colleges. %$* 353
i don’t think that’s really a mis-description, but so much of this conversation from peter and charles has been a focus where they’re negative about the general b.a.or presumably the humanities and social sciences. %$* 353
so let me speak up for the humanities and social sciences. %$* 353
so the, you know, there are lots of smart people who think analytically and rigorously who take the humanities and social sciences, who are art history majors, god love them, and who are historians and who learn arabic and who learn chinese, or who learn hindi or who learn whatever. %$* 353
and we’re going to send lots of those people. %$* 353
they need to have those languages. %$* 353
they need to learn cultures that are different from the u.s.they’re going to be business people who go abroad. %$* 353
they’re going to be diplomats, whoever they may be, so why should we only think that the only place to get an education which is rigorous, analytical, and will serve you well is going to be in the engineering, mathematics-- %$* 353
so what’s really going on in the center for nanofabrication and molecular self assembly? %$* 13
those are not english majors hanging out there. %$* 13
no, nothing i said is against the sciences. %$* 353
i sunk a fortune into the sciences, and we hired the best chemists and computer scientists we could hire, and that’s great. %$* 353
i don’t think it’s one hand here or the other hand that. %$* 353
you can do lots of things in a great university. %$* 353
charles murray. %$* 13
i just want to comment that when we talk about the humanities and social sciences and rigorous critical thinking, i’m not only in favor that, i think we have a darth of it in the university system. %$* 354
the problem is we are talking as if universities consisted of stanford, of northwestern and harvard and places like that. %$* 354
very few kids go to those colleges. %$* 354
most of them are at west podunk state or its equivalent. %$* 354
and you are talking about course that they’re no relation-- %$* 354
could you name some names, seriously, of the types of colleges that you’re referring to? %$* 13
yeah, you take the state university systems which usually have about three tiers. %$* 354
there’s the, like ohio state and iowa university and so forth. %$* 354
then there’s a second tier of colleges which are acknowledged to be not nearly as good even though they’re four- year and sometimes there’s a third tier. %$* 354
and those are the places where you are getting the courses that teach economics with magazine articles, that teach shakespeare by having kids watch movies of shakespeare’s plays but you don’t ask them to read them, places where kids do not-- %$* 354
i’m not talking anecdotes. %$* 354
i’m talking surveys about the percentages of kids who graduate from college unable to write grammatical sentences. %$* 354
critical thinking doesn’t enter the realm of college life in those places. %$* 354
question right in the center with the beret. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
hi. %$* 19
my name is irene and i’m a final-year physics college student. %$* 19
and my question is, as a society, we’ve grown up with the notion of the importance of a well-rounded individual which is why a number of four-year bachelor programs in the u.s.have a substantial amount of unrelated course work that has nothing to do with a person’s major. %$* 19
on the other hand, europe, which recently adopted the three-year bachelor system a couple of years ago, has much less of that unrelated, more well- rounded amount of coursework and more focus on the concrete, actual coursework that pertains to one’s major. %$* 19
and my question to you is which system do you think has an advantage in the future? %$* 19
well, may i respond first by saying that if the required course in the humanities was to take the epic poem from homer to milton, i’d say that’s great. %$* 354
if it’s to take the epic film from ben hur to lord of the rings, it’s not so great. %$* 354
so well-- %$* 354
so what we have as course requirements in this country, it just doesn’t fit this image you want to see of people sitting aristotle and the classics and the rest of it. %$* 354
it’s not the curriculum. %$* 354
sir, there-- %$* 13
you’re behind-- %$* 13
yeah, thank you. %$* 13
and the mic’s coming from your right side. %$* 13
my name’s randall spencer. %$* 358
could you-- %$* 13
we didn’t turn the mic on. %$* 13
could you just repeat now? %$* 13
i think it’s ready for you. %$* 13
my name’s randall spencer. %$* 358
i myself graduated from a four-year college with an engineering degree. %$* 358
we’ve heard about students that-- %$* 358
how much more people make by getting college degrees. %$* 358
but what do we know about those who think that they have this idea that college is something that they’re supposed to do, and they end up going to college and building up debt and they don’t finish. %$* 358
what do we know about them as far as the money they make, the debt they accrue, the percentage of people that are going to college and are not directly-- %$* 358
can i rephrase your question to put a twist on it to relate it to our topic, is are so many kids-- %$* 13
are there people going to college who are hurt by going to college? %$* 13
right, exactly. %$* 358
and are there more or less-- %$* 358
henry-- %$* 13
okay, great question. %$* 13
henry bienen. %$* 13
it's interesting. %$* 353
the data shows, and the data is conclusive on this, that it's not just getting a degree which increases your life chances and your income. %$* 353
in fact, even in community colleges, which are basically two-year places, if you're in there for a period of time like one semester, you have a better chance, and you'll earn more money than if you never went. %$* 353
and this is true of two-year, four-year colleges, whatever. %$* 353
so it's-- %$* 353
if you look at this, it's almost linear that the more time you spend in college, irrespective of whether you get a degree, pays off for you. %$* 353
now, there is a sheepskin effect at around 16 years. %$* 353
but it's a little bump. %$* 353
it's not a huge bump so-- %$* 353
how do you know that going to college is what causes that benefit as opposed to people who are able to achieve those sorts of things in life rather than people who select to go to college? %$* 13
well, there's always a causation issue, as i said from the beginning. %$* 353
it's not so clear often what's correlation and what's cause. %$* 353
on this one, i think we have lots of study which show that when you try to normalize or hold account for all the other variables, and there are lots of them; family background, environment, even intelligence. %$* 353
i mean, some people are smarter than other people. %$* 353
that's a fact of life. %$* 353
whatever you do, you still find a college effect. %$* 353
but the point i was making to this question, john, because i think it's a very important question, that-- %$* 353
and even if you look at debt, if you look at the number of years in college or the number of even months in college, it's extraordinary. %$* 353
it pays off. %$* 353
peter thiel. %$* 13
well, you know, i think there is-- %$* 352
i think it pays off but not nearly as much as you think because i still think it's mostly correlation and just a tiny bit causation. %$* 352
but i want to quibble a little bit more with the idea of the data shows and what this means. %$* 352
and we're always looking backwards. %$* 352
and so 2005, you could have said the data shows that housing prices always go up. %$* 352
and they are less likely to go up if they've gone up a lot. %$* 352
and so what i will tell you as an analytic truth, not an empirical truth, when people are paying way more than they ever have, there are going to be more people who have been hurt than who were hurt in the '50s or '60s, when it was effectively free. %$* 352
and so-- %$* 352
and this will not be seen in advance. %$* 352
you will see this in 10, 15, 20 years time. %$* 352
you're starting to see it with college students, have to move back in with their parents because they cannot afford to get their own place and pay off their debts. %$* 352
so is that the popping of the bubble that you referred to, this college being when you described it as a bubble in housing, and housing crashed obviously when credit dried up. %$* 13
what is the-- %$* 13
what is the popping of the college bubble? %$* 13
it's-- %$* 352
what i think we are seeing a gradually unravel with the-- %$* 352
with this incredible recession in the u.s. because the basic lie that you take on all this debt, and then you get a good job is being seen as not quite true. %$* 352
and there are many cases where it's not true. %$* 352
and i basically think it's sort of-- %$* 352
we see it unravel over four or five years as you have one class after another graduate, and there are no good jobs, even for the people with college degrees. %$* 352
i would say it's different from housing because there's no specific market. %$* 352
you can't precisely evaluate a college degree. %$* 352
and that's actually one of the things that makes it a much more pernicious bubble than housing because it will not pop instantly, and therefore it's likely to be actually even more pronounced and more extreme before it unravels. %$* 352
another question from the rear there. %$* 13
hi. %$* 19
i'm exploration and a graduation of the university of chicago. %$* 19
we've heard lots of reasons to go to college. %$* 19
most of it has been about work and economics, a little bit about the need to meet diverse people, be exposed to things we might not see before. %$* 19
in the spirit of the debate, could you clarify what it is you think college is actually for? %$* 19
what's the end or purpose of college? %$* 19
what a great question. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
henry bienen or vivek, if you want to take that. %$* 13
different strokes for different folks. %$* 353
i think it's what you make of it. %$* 353
i think it can be sometimes very focused. %$* 353
it can be, as vivek has said, people don't know what they want to do until they get there. %$* 353
you learn, how do i know what i want to be until i grow up. %$* 353
i don't have a handy dandy formula. %$* 353
i think it's a good question, but i don't think there's an answer to it that it should be this or that because people are so diverse. %$* 353
they come with different interests, different experiences, different backgrounds. %$* 353
and they grow presumably in those-- %$* 353
in those years in college. %$* 353
and many of them find themselves. %$* 353
they get sparked by different things. %$* 353
i don't know what's going to spark somebody's interest. %$* 353
i mentioned for steve jobs it was a calligraphy course he stepped into. %$* 353
for somebody, it may be reading shakespeare. %$* 353
it may be looking at beautiful paintings. %$* 353
it may be listening to beautiful music. %$* 353
it may be all of a sudden math grabs them, and they didn't know what they could do. %$* 353
but would it ever be watching lord of the rings. %$* 13
could be. %$* 13
one more question on the far right, ma'am. %$* 13
yep, if you could just stand up. %$* 13
hello. %$* 359
my name is layla dolsin and i'm currently an mba student at the university of chicago. %$* 359
we've heard that-- %$* 359
or some of you have compared college education to a bubble. %$* 359
and i'm sitting here wondering whether it might not be a bubble but rather inflation. %$* 359
the same kind of healthy inflation that you would experience with inflation of gdp as the economy grows. %$* 359
so what i'm wondering is, do you feel like high school education, in the same way that it might have been sufficient for society in the '60s, is also sufficient for society today. %$* 359
thank you. %$* 359
charles murray. %$* 13
well, since i said that virtually everybody needs more education and training after high school, obviously, i think that high school is not sufficient. %$* 354
i do think that a great deal of what we talk about as a liberal education can be done at the k-12 level. %$* 354
there are things like the core knowledge curriculum that's created by edie hirsch, which is just wonderful. %$* 354
and it doesn't teach everybody a full-fledged classical education, but it-- %$* 354
it gets a lot of the common cultural knowledge for everyone in k-12.we aren't doing it in college. %$* 354
i think we could do it there. %$* 354
let me take one more question. %$* 13
green, wearing all green. %$* 13
hello. %$* 360
my name-- %$* 360
hello, my name is katherine darts and i'm an architect and academic here, that is educated in chicago, paris and copenhagen also. %$* 360
my question to everyone on the panel, what do academic institutions need to do to eliminate the influence-based system of family's previous alumni relations and money that keep us from having this open competition of education that mr. %$* 360
murray wants and get us to the opportunity of-- %$* 360
i'm going to respectfully pass on the question, although i think it's a very valid point, because i don't think it's going to get us to the issue of whether too many kids go to college or not. %$* 13
sir, in the black tie. %$* 13
but thank you for the question. %$* 13
hi. %$* 361
my name is phil pappus when i was young, i-- %$* 361
i read that majority of the ceos in fortune 500 companies only had a high school education. %$* 361
due to the deterioration of secondary education in the united states, isn't college, a college degree, a necessity to show that you have something that was once called a high school degree? %$* 361
peter thiel. %$* 13
it's possible that that's-- %$* 352
well, i think high school is very-- %$* 352
lots of them are still very good. %$* 352
a lot of them are not. %$* 352
but i-- %$* 352
it seems to me that that's a perverse cure for the disease. %$* 352
and so if that is the disease, we should be fixing k through 12 education. %$* 352
and i think probably all of us on the panel would agree that k through 12 education has a lot of room for improvement. %$* 352
all right. %$* 13
and i have to say that concludes round two of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
and here is where we are. %$* 13
we are about to hear brief closing statements from each debater. %$* 13
the statements will be two minutes each. %$* 13
they will be uninterrupted. %$* 13
and remember, you voted before the debate, and this is their last chance for them to try to convince you that they have argued most persuasively. %$* 13
and you'll be asked to vote once again and choose a winner just a few minutes from now. %$* 13
so onto round three, closing statements from each debater in turn. %$* 13
our motion is this: "too many kids go to college." and here to speak against the motion, henry bienen, president emeritus of northwestern university. %$* 13
well, no one seems to doubt, including our opponents, that there is a wage premium and a benefit to college. %$* 353
they may have some confusion about what kind of college, whether they're expensive or not, though the debate was not about cost, as i understood it. %$* 353
mr. %$* 353
thiel raises, i think, interesting points about causation, the direction of causation. %$* 353
but i think it's clear also that going to college isn't of itself an effect. %$* 353
it's a variable which moves people along in their lives, gives them more chance and gives them more income, independent of all the other things that get them to college in the first place. %$* 353
now, yes, there are too many people who are unprepared that go to college. %$* 353
and i agree with what peter said at the very last minute, that it would be a perverse effect to say, okay, college is going to be remedial for the lousy high school education that they got. %$* 353
the answer to that, which we're trying very hard to do in chicago, is to improve the k through 12 elementary and high school education. %$* 353
and that's key. %$* 353
that is key to society as it is to make sure that higher education is good and affordable for all. %$* 353
so the answer is not that too many kids go to college any more than it would be too many kid go to high school or elementary school because they don't get a good education in too many of those places, and i'm sure there are plenty of colleges where they don't get a good education, sure, i'm sure that's the case. %$* 353
i've just never been in any of them but i know that they exist. %$* 353
so i think the answer is very clear and that you have to decide in the negative on the proposition that too many kids go to college. %$* 353
that is after all the proposition, it's not about costs, it's not about whether everything is perfect, at every college in the country, it's not about whether we should do everything exactly how we've done it, it is the proposition that too many kids go to college, and the answer is clearly and unequivocally that's a wrong answer. %$* 353
thank you, henry bienen. %$* 13
there's a little bit of a lag on that one, but our motion is "too many kids go to college," and here to summarize his position in support of the motion, peter thiel. %$* 13
he is paypal cofounder who's 20 under 20 fellowship awards grant cash to young tech entrepreneurs. %$* 13
the one thing that was clearly not done by the other side was to answer my question about where would the accountability be for all the people who get hurt by the system that costs too much and is not delivering. %$* 352
and it is clear to me that there is no accountability on the part of our education establishment. %$* 352
they're not willing to give people refunds. %$* 352
they're not-- %$* 352
you know, if you get a ford and it blows up, a ford pinto blows up, you can go to the ford company, you can get money back for your car, you might even be able to sue them for torts, such a mentality is unthinkable in the college case. %$* 352
and given that there is this lack of accountability, buyer beware. %$* 352
you are on your own. %$* 352
you take on the loans. %$* 352
it's worse than housing debt. %$* 352
you can never get out of it, not even through bankruptcy. %$* 352
bush amended the bankruptcy laws in 2005 so you cannot get out of college debts for the rest of your life. %$* 352
and you need to think about this on your own. %$* 352
the way bubbles end is when people start thinking for themselves. %$* 352
and that is the first thing we want to encourage people to do is not to simply go with the social pressure, not to go with the bill of goods, "this has always been done. %$* 352
this is automatic. %$* 352
this is necessary. %$* 352
this is globalization." but think for yourself, "is the cost worth the benefit? %$* 352
" and when more people think for themselves about this, we will get to a very different equilibrium where there's less of a caste system, less of a social need to do these things for status reasons, people will still go to college, they will still get advance degrees, but there will be fewer of them who do it because there are a lot of people who are doing it for the wrong reasons, and i think that will be a much healthier and more balanced country. %$* 352
thank you, peter thiel. %$* 13
our motion is "too many kids go to college."and here now to summarize his position against the motion, vivek wadhwa. %$* 13
he is director of research at duke center for entrepreneurship and research commercialization. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 211
what i heard from the other side was that if we define college the way middle america does, then we actually are agreeing that we want more kids to go to college, so i'm not going to spend my two minutes on that. %$* 211
i want to actually challenge my new friend, peter thiel, on something which is very dear to his heart, about the fact that it's so expensive to go to college. %$* 211
that i agree with him on. %$* 211
and it's also antiquated. %$* 211
the system's antiquated. %$* 211
peter and i are both associated with a great university called singular university, which is on campus, where we teach about exponential technologies, how all these advances are happening which can change the world, impact the lives of billions. %$* 211
well, you know, think about it, five or 10 years ago did you ever use an iphone or an android? %$* 211
none of us did. %$* 211
i'll bet you everyone in the audience has one today. %$* 211
the fact is that it's now possible to communicate in ways we could never do before. %$* 211
we have these tabular devices which can deliver 3d simulations, take us into 3d worlds. %$* 211
we can teach people by taking them into games. %$* 211
we can change the entire concept of education. %$* 211
he has the ability to do that. %$* 211
he has done it before with social network, with facebook, he's done it with paypal. %$* 211
he has the ability to do this. %$* 211
instead of investing in silly little social media technologies, why don't we put our joint efforts into improving education if it's changing the way we deliver, to change the way we educate-- %$* 211
and changing the world. %$* 211
i tell you, peter, you can make it happen. %$* 211
so i challenge you here publicly to put your energy into improving education, into automating, into rethinking the way we educate so that the masses can get educated because all of us agree that we do want more people to go to whatever we call college. %$* 211
again, i'm not going to define it as a four-year degree, again to get more education so we can be more competitive, we can take on the world, we can change the world together. %$* 211
we're going to need it more than ever over the next few decades. %$* 211
thank you, vivek wadhwa. %$* 13
our motion is "too many kids go to college." and now to speak in support of the motion, charles murray. %$* 13
he is author of "real education: four simple truths for bringing america's schools back to reality." %$* 13
i think that even though we're supposed to be diametrically opposed, in fact there’s a lot of common ground. %$* 354
it’s not a very good thing to say in a debate. %$* 354
but suppose we got rid of the b.a.because it doesn’t mean anything. %$* 354
suppose we had as the goal of education not this piece of paper, but we had as a goal of education that all children shall reach adulthood having discovered things they love to do and having learned how to do them well. %$* 354
if we take that as the goal of education, we will have a system utterly different from the one we have now, and it will not be college as we know it. %$* 354
it will not be four years, and a lot of times, it won’t be residential. %$* 354
and most of all, it will not separate people into those who are college graduates and those who are not. %$* 354
and the fact is that every career-- %$* 354
excuse me-- %$* 354
goes through a couple of phases. %$* 354
we all start out as apprentices. %$* 354
and after we learn our trade, we become journeyman. %$* 354
and some of us who get really good at it become master craftsmen. %$* 354
that is just as true of a history professor or a lawyer or a physician as it of a carpenter or a plumber or an electrician. %$* 354
the kinds of changes we need to make to our educational system, sweeping, fundamental reforms, getting rid of the b.a., moving to certifications, has as its ultimate goal, in my view, something that is very important for america as it is increasingly stratified by class. %$* 354
and that is that it promotes a recognition among us that we are all engaged in the same process. %$* 354
we are not divided into professionals and service workers or blue collar workers. %$* 354
we all start out as apprentices. %$* 354
we become journeyman, and we all strive to become master craftsmen. %$* 354
thank you. %$* 354
thank you, charles murray. %$* 13
and that concludes our closing statements. %$* 13
we have been though all three rounds of this debate now, and it is time to learn which side you feel has argued best. %$* 13
we’re asking you again to go to the keypad at your seat that will register your vote. %$* 13
we’re asking you to judge on this motion, "too many kids go to college.” which side presented the stronger arguments? %$* 13
press number one if you feel this side, arguing too many kids go to college, presented a better argument. %$* 13
press number two is it was this side. %$* 13
press number three if you are or became undecided in the course of the debate. %$* 13
and we’ll have the results in about 90 seconds from now. %$* 13
so before i announce the results of that debate, i just want to first of all thank our panelists for coming here with the attitude and the kind of argument that we encourage. %$* 13
they were terrific. %$* 13
and i want to say something about the questions that were asked here tonight. %$* 13
i really wish that i can import you folks back to new york. %$* 13
because we had a lot of trouble with the question situation there, and you all really got the message. %$* 13
and there wasn’t a bad one among them. %$* 13
and so thank you very much, and thanks to the audience for all of that. %$* 13
so this is our first debate in the city of chicago, and it was our second outside of new york. %$* 13
and we want to thank very, very much the organizers of chicago ideas week for inviting us to be part of this program with them. %$* 13
and we also want to spend a very, very huge thanks to grovenor capital management who underwrote tonight’s debate for us and made the whole thing possible. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
so we are-- %$* 13
we head back to new york. %$* 13
we have two more debates in the fall season. %$* 13
you can actually watch those online, as this one, it’s been streamed by our media partner, slate. %$* 13
it will be 5:45 p.m. %$* 13
on our debate days. %$* 13
and this is what we’re doing. %$* 13
on october 25, we’re debating the motion, “congress should approve obama’s jobs plan.” the panelists at this point include the chief economist at moody’s analytics and also a former economic advisor to president obama. %$* 13
on november 15, our motion is "the world would be better off without religion.” and our panelists then include a rabbi and charles darwin’s great-great grandson. %$* 13
streaming at 5:45 on slate.com. %$* 13

can you at the margins of, you know, 1 percent or 5 percent, delay when they get the gun, or can you also have laws that say well, we can't really shut down the black market, but we can say that if you're a convicted felon for a genuinely violent crime and you're found carrying a gun, that there's going to be a severe sentence and that-- %$* 433
the studies do show that has some deterrent effect on them carrying guns. %$* 433
so i think you can't-- %$* 433
i want-- %$* 13
again, you know, i'm sorry to be stickler about this, but we'll wander all over and you're going to have to vote on this amendment language shortly, and that's why i'm trying to keep the questions focused on that. %$* 13
so, sir, i hope you're going to deliver for me. %$* 13
and it's a tough one, by the way. %$* 13
i don't think it's particularly easy to frame a question on this one. %$* 13
hi. %$* 18
my name is fortuna. %$* 18
i have a question to david and eugene. %$* 18
so, if you guys were to write constitution from scratch, what words would you put in place of the second amendment to properly represent the point of view you are defending? %$* 18
great question. %$* 13
and how-- %$* 13
language that you could come up with that would defend against these guys and give you what you want. %$* 13
who would like to take that? %$* 13
david kopel or eugene volokh? %$* 13
i think eugene is about to give you a quote, but the short answer is-- %$* 433
modern state constitutions say it in modern language, and so any one of those recent ones, wisconsin, for example. %$* 433
you would take out that whole militia thing? %$* 13
so let me read to you the 1998 wisconsin provision, which was close backed by then state senator russ feingold, not exactly the most conservative of conservatives. %$* 434
it says, "the people have the right to keep and bear arms for security defense, hunting, recreation, or any other lawful purpose."so that's what senator feingold was willing to say. %$* 434
i actually don't think that the preamble today-- %$* 434
the militia clause today-- %$* 434
is terribly helpful. %$* 434
if i had to re-write it, i'd probably end up-- %$* 434
i wouldn't worry about the possible political blowback that might cause even more infringement on this issue. %$* 434
i probably would-- %$* 434
eugene-- %$* 13
just when you turn your head-- %$* 13
got it. %$* 434
can you be careful of the mic? %$* 13
so i probably wouldn't include it. %$* 434
and i actually wouldn't include hunting, recreation, or any other lawful purpose. %$* 434
i think that is something that could be left to the political process. %$* 434
but i think the people have the right to keep and bear arms for security and defense. %$* 434
i think russell feingold-- %$* 434
that's one of the few things that i'm going to agree with russell feingold on. %$* 434
i'd like to see what the other side would say to that. %$* 13
sandy levinson. %$* 13
two quick things. %$* 432
i like state constitutions and their ability to experiment. %$* 432
one of the things i like about state constitutions is that with almost no exception, they're all easier to amend than the u.s. constitution. %$* 432
so, if the good people of wisconsin should decide in the next 10 years that maybe this is too broad, then it's really very easy to amend the constitution. %$* 432
one of the problems with the united states constitution is that it's next to impossible to amend, so that we are stuck with the language of 1787 or 1791, which you're happy to jettison. %$* 432
but which does involve, in fact, re-writing the history of the second amendment and re-writing what many people thought was the original meaning of the second amendment. %$* 432
right there, ma'am. %$* 13
hi. %$* 19
my name is stephanie, and i have a question. %$* 19
does the second amendment protect the right to bear unsafe or unregulated firearms as a product? %$* 19
and what is the government's role in ensuring that firearms are safe to use, reduce accidents, and to-- %$* 19
the misuse of firearm products, especially for-- %$* 19
by young children and by minors? %$* 19
thank you. %$* 13
because when you mentioned chicago, those are kids under the age of 21. young people under the age of 21. %$* 19
that was a very, very well-focused question. %$* 13
i'm going to-- %$* 13
i'm assuming it was to this side, arguing against the motion. %$* 13
those-- %$* 433
david kopel. %$* 13
those things you mentioned are legitimate governmental purposes. %$* 433
and the question-- %$* 433
if-- %$* 433
in pursuit of those legitimate governmental purposes, what are the particular laws which advance them? %$* 433
and do those laws significantly harm the ability of law-abiding people to use guns for lawful purposes? %$* 433
and you can look at different laws on these subjects. %$* 433
and as i'd say, some fail the test and some pass the test. %$* 433
and i should just say, not a single second amendment decision or state-- %$* 434
or decision under any of the 44 state constitutional rights to keep and bear arms contradict that or undermine the safety issue that you're raising. %$* 434
so, if, for example, a state court imposes liability because a gun is prone to misfiring or something like that, no constitutional problem. %$* 434
there's an interesting debate as to what the proper regulatory scheme for that is. %$* 434
but the second amendment is not an obstacle because-- %$* 434
well, that's what you say. %$* 305
but just remember what-- %$* 305
alan dershowitz. %$* 13
david said. %$* 305
david said that he's going to mount a second amendment constitutional challenge to new york's law that prevents you from taking your gun out of the state. %$* 305
so, there's always the threat, if there's a constitutional amendment, that every regulation will be challenged. %$* 305
the nra thinks everything is unconstitutional-- %$* 305
locks on guns, safety provisions for guns, making sure guns are stored properly. %$* 305
the nra can make a constitutional argument against any reasonable regulation. %$* 305
i think every-- %$* 305
and so could-- %$* 433
body has to-- %$* 305
the aclu. %$* 433
admit-- %$* 305
everybody has to admit that if there is a constitutional amendment, the presumption is against regulation. %$* 305
if there is no constitutional amendment, the presumption is in favor of regulation. %$* 305
that's why we ought not to constitutionalize this right. %$* 305
we ought to constitutionalize the right of self-defense, but not the derivative right of gun ownership. %$* 305
alan, this is like saying that the fourth amendment-- %$* 434
the problem with the fourth amendment is that every single criminal defendant can try to argue for reading it extra broadly and excluding all the evidence against them, and they do. %$* 434
and they lose. %$* 434
they lose. %$* 305
we judge the fourth amendment by how it's actually been interpreted, rather than by some possibility that maybe it's going to be over-interpreted-- %$* 434
this is just the beginning. %$* 305
the second amendment? %$* 434
no. %$* 434
the right to keep and bear arms has been around-- %$* 434
as an individual right-- %$* 434
10 years-- %$* 305
since 1776, at the state level-- %$* 434
there are dozens-- %$* 434
there are dozens-- %$* 434
of court decisions from the 1800s on to the 1900s into 2000s, interpreting it. %$* 434
none of them have had the effect of striking down any such laws. %$* 434
sir, could you come down just a few steps, so the camera can see you. %$* 13
you're a little bit of shadow. %$* 13
just three steps. %$* 13
that's great, sir. %$* 13
my name's eric. %$* 18
so, my question is that-- %$* 18
so on the campus where staten island college now sits was willowbrook where the state of new york interns the mentally ill children to die. %$* 18
if we believe that the right of self-defense is to protect vulnerable citizens, which you have all said, and given that in the press, tv news, and even here tonight we've demonized the mentally ill, is it not a violation of the civil rights of the mentally ill to bear arms? %$* 18
i think it's a legitimate question. %$* 432
that is to say-- %$* 432
wait. %$* 13
are you saying is it a violation of their right to deny them the ability to bear arms? %$* 13
yes. %$* 18
justice scalia, without presenting any argument, announced in heller that just as martha stewart can be deprived of her right to self-defense, it apparently was the case that all laws limiting the rights of mentally ill people, a notoriously accordion-like term, could be limited. %$* 432
i presume that all of us agree there are some mentally ill people who shouldn't be allowed close to a gun. %$* 432
i would imagine that as a policy matter, not as a constitutional matter, all of us might well agree that there are some mentally ill people whom we would, in fact, allow to have a gun if we really do take self-defense very seriously. %$* 432
this-- %$* 432
what you might want is legislators, city councils, et cetera, to write very careful legislation and tell us which is which, rather than to leave this up to judges who, quite frankly, have no training whatsoever in discerning differences of level of mental illness, or have no training in trying to figure out what, if anything, the data actually support. %$* 432
would the other side like to respond? %$* 13
sandy, that's exactly what justice scalia's opinion does, is he basically says that in terms of gun bans for people who are mentally ill, that the second amendment as he interprets it, is not going to intervene and it's going to be left to the political process. %$* 433
now, the gun control act of 1968, the main federal law, is a lifetime ban on gun possession by anybody who has ever been found to be in the words of the congressional statute, our laws, mentally defective. %$* 433
i think that that has reflected the somewhat prejudices of the time, and as sandy has said, that there is-- %$* 433
there are some people-- %$* 433
mentally ill people on the whole are less violent than the general public. %$* 433
there is also a small subset of them who are dangerously violent and absolutely should be prohibited from possessing guns, but i would also-- %$* 433
i agree with you that the breadth of the current prohibition, i don't think, fully makes sense based on current understandings and social science. %$* 433
so there's a touch of agreement on this. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
and this concludes round two of this intelligence squared u.s. debate-- %$* 13
where our motion is: the constitutional right to bear arms has outlived its usefulness. %$* 13
remember we had you vote just before the debate began and immediately after this closing round of closing statements we're going to have you vote a second time. %$* 13
the team whose numbers have changed the most will be declared our winner. %$* 13
on to round three, closing statements. %$* 13
each debater will make a closing statement in turn uninterrupted. %$* 13
they will be two minutes each. %$* 13
our motion is this: the constitutional right to bear arms has outlived its usefulness. %$* 13
and here to summarize his position against this motion to persuade you to vote against, eugene volokh. %$* 13
he's professor of law at the ucla school of law. %$* 13
so, we've heard all sorts of things about death, about assassination, about futility. %$* 434
i want to end this on a cheerful note. %$* 434
i want to tell you about some good news. %$* 434
so, from 1993 on, the size-- %$* 434
the amount of guns in america increased from 200 million to probably about 300 million. %$* 434
now, you might think that's good news or not, but that's not what i'm claiming is good news. %$* 434
likewise, or since from the mid-- %$* 434
in the mid-'80s about 10 states, any law abiding adult could carry a gun concealed on his person just by getting a license, except for one of the 10, you didn’t even need a license. %$* 434
that state, it turns out, was vermont. %$* 434
now that number is over 40. during that time, and i'm not going to say-- %$* 434
i'm not making a causal claim here, i will tell you the claim i'm making in a moment. %$* 434
during that time, the homicide rate and the firearms homicide rate, basically fell by a factor of two. %$* 434
the general violent crime rate and the gun violent crime rate basically fell by a factor of roughly three to four. %$* 434
i will tell you, the number-- %$* 434
it was so shocking, i thought it was just nonsense spread on the internet. %$* 434
but if it is, it's spread on the internet by the bureau of justice statistics, so that gives it some special claim as nonsense goes. %$* 434
so-- %$* 434
i think it's probably not nonsense. %$* 434
the serious violent crime with guns against youths, age 12 to 17, fell by a factor of 20-- %$* 434
by 95 percent. %$* 434
now, i'm not saying that the growing gun stock caused-- %$* 434
that's-- %$* 434
there's actually a hot debate about that-- %$* 434
i don't know what the right answer is. %$* 434
but it seems to have happened in spite of the growing gun stock. %$* 434
we'd think, if some of the arguments we've heard are correct, the result would have been vast amount of bloodshed. %$* 434
it hasn't been. %$* 434
something worked. %$* 434
we don't know what. %$* 434
nobody really quite knows what. %$* 434
but something has caused this tremendous and sustained decline of crime. %$* 434
we should be looking to see what that was. %$* 434
it wasn't gun control, maybe it wasn't gun de-control. %$* 434
it was something. %$* 434
that's-- %$* 434
eugene volokh. %$* 13
what we should be thinking about-- %$* 434
thank you very much. %$* 13
and not guns. %$* 434
your time is up. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
eugene volokh. %$* 13
our motion is: the constitutional right to bear arms has outlived its usefulness. %$* 13
and here to summarize his position in support of this motion, to persuade you to vote for it, sanford levinson, author of "framed: america's 51 constitutions and the crisis of governance" and a professor of government and professor of law at the university of texas in austin. %$* 13
sanford levinson. %$* 13
all right. %$* 432
it's no surprise that my friend eugene volokh makes very, very powerful, eloquent arguments about the public policy of gun control. %$* 432
but that's not what we're debating this evening. %$* 432
the question is to what extent any particular policy should be constitutionalized, which at the national level, means that it's close to written in stone and impervious to any change in the future. %$* 432
and i really do think when you vote, that ought to be the principal question you're asking, not whether you believe a particular policy in 2013 makes sense, because if you constitutionalize it, you also have to say, "it's going to make sense in 2023, 2033, and ad infinitum." secondly, i think david kopel used interestingly different language at different points in his argument. %$* 432
and he, too, has made very capable arguments. %$* 432
i don't know him so well as i know eugene, so you shouldn't take anything amiss when i don't refer to him as my friend. %$* 432
i've known eugene, you know-- %$* 432
since he was a child, almost. %$* 432
but-- %$* 432
he was very bright. %$* 18
at one point, david said that-- %$* 432
i think it was washington's policy-- %$* 432
no rational person could agree with it. %$* 432
that was new york city-- %$* 433
oh, okay. %$* 432
new york-- %$* 432
it really doesn't matter. %$* 432
these are uninterrupted. %$* 13
now, i really-- %$* 432
don't think it's the case that you have to be a lunatic to agree with michael bloomberg. %$* 432
maybe he's got the wrong policy. %$* 432
but it seems to me that the rationality test-- %$* 432
at least the way that lawyers use it-- %$* 432
really does require that you believe the other side is truly lunatic. %$* 432
but what was telling is that in his more recent comment, he said, in effect, that there are legitimate reasons for-- %$* 432
there are reasonable people who disagree. %$* 432
and-- %$* 432
sanford levinson, i'm sorry, your time is up-- %$* 13
we can-- %$* 432
thank you. %$* 13
disagree. %$* 432
our-- %$* 13
our motion is: the constitutional right to bear arms has outlived its usefulness. %$* 13
and here to summarize his position against this motion, david kopel, research director at the independence institute and associate policy analyst at the cato institute. %$* 13
professor dershowitz wants to re-litigate the constitutionality of the civil war. %$* 433
well, that settled, actually, the question that we have for tonight in our political process. %$* 433
as of 1850, the bill of rights, as interpreted by federal courts, was only a limit on the federal government and did not apply to the states. %$* 433
and then we had the civil war, and the terrible violations of the rights of the freedman that happened after the civil war, when the southern states abolished slavery in name, but tried to keep the freedmen in de facto servitude and subjugation by saying they could only have public assemblies when they got special permission, and by saying they needed special permission, if ever, that they could possess firearms for protection. %$* 433
and again, that was part of the ku klux klan's strategy of disarming them. %$* 433
the country recognized that not only were the oppressions of the freedmen under these black codes-- %$* 433
the new slave codes-- %$* 433
human rights violations in themselves, but that the lack of civil liberty in the south had been one of the important causes of the war, because it led to the suppression of speech, criticizing slavery, and poisoned the political dialogue there. %$* 433
and so, the country said we love diversity, we love the vastness of our country and the different state experimentations, but some experiments are so dangerous that they lead to catastrophe and we tried the experiment of saying we’ll just leave it up to state governments to protect civil liberties. %$* 433
that’s not enough. %$* 433
we need to set a national baseline on human rights and the 14th amendment was enacted to make the bill of rights, including especially the first and second amendments, applicable to the states. %$* 433
the baseline of the second amendment does not outlaw all gun control, and it allows montana to go much further in protecting gun rights than new york city does, but it says everywhere that there are american citizens every government must respect the baseline of the fundamental civil rights contained in our bill of rights. %$* 433
that was new york city-- %$* 433
thank you, david kopel. %$* 13
our motion: the constitutional right to bear arms has outlived its usefulness; and here to summarize his position for the motion, alan dershowitz, professor of law at harvard law school. %$* 13
i ask you to vote for the motion based largely on what professor volokh has brilliantly argued. %$* 305
he has conceded that he wouldn’t include a militia in his model bill of rights. %$* 305
he also has conceded that he wouldn’t constitutionalize the right of hunting. %$* 305
by making those two arguments, he has conceded the basic proposition: that the second amendment the way it’s currently written is anachronistic and has outlived its usefulness. %$* 305
he would substitute another amendment for that, an amendment much like the one that he said was passed in wisconsin. %$* 305
it seems to me that they have conceded away the basic argument, namely that the second amendment as written is anachronistic. %$* 305
what’s left? %$* 305
what’s left is: do we really want militia groups that are armed today, and armed under the second amendment, to have the right to confront our government and try to conduct yet another revolution of the kind that we had back in the american revolution and the civil war? %$* 305
it seems to me the answer to that is quite clearly no. %$* 305
sigmund freud had a very famous statement back 100 years ago in which he said, “the first human who hurled an insult instead of a stone was the founder of civilization.” the first amendment protects insults. %$* 305
it does not protect stones, it does not protect violence. %$* 305
we could live very comfortably with a first amendment and without a second amendment. %$* 305
i don’t want to amend the bill of rights because i worry that other things could happen, but i do want to make it very clear that the second amendment with its emphasis on militias and hunting, and with no mention of self-defense has outlived its usefulness. %$* 305
therefore i urge you to vote yes and let’s begin a debate on whether we should have an amendment protecting the right of self-defense, not the right of guns. %$* 305
thank you, alan dershowitz. %$* 13
and that concludes our closing statements. %$* 13
and now it’s time to learn which side has argued the best. %$* 13
we’re going to ask you again to go to the keypads at your seat and to push the button that will register your vote. %$* 13
remember the motion is this: the constitutional right to bear arms has outlived its usefulness. %$* 13
if you now side with this motion-- %$* 13
with this team, push number one. %$* 13
if you are against this motion-- %$* 13
if you’re with this team, push number two. %$* 13
if you became or remain undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and we’ll have the results in about 90 seconds from now. %$* 13
so while that’s happening, what’d i’d like to do-- %$* 13
first of all is say that our goal in this debate was to touch on this topic, but in a way that maybe you’ve never heard it argued before, and to have it argued well, and i really think that we succeeded in doing that thanks to the spirit of fairness and decency-- %$* 13
all of these debaters brought to the stage. %$* 13
and as you could see me struggling with shaping this questions and to-- %$* 13
we’re not used to framing it this way so everybody who got up and asked a question, even if i didn’t take it, i appreciate that you got up and tried. %$* 13
i can obviously sense the passion that everyone in this room feels about this issue. %$* 13
so to everybody who asked a question and those who didn’t get to, i really want to thank you as well for getting up and moving that along. %$* 13
like to have you tweet about this debate. %$* 13
use the twitter handle @iq2us and #gunsdebate. %$* 13
you can join the 43,000 nra members who have-- %$* 13
who have-- %$* 13
and we say welcome to intelligence squared u.s.we're glad to have you. %$* 13
we're glad you discovered us. %$* 13
our next debate at the kaufman will be on wednesday, december 4th. %$* 13
the motion on that debate-- %$* 13
at that debate will be: don't eat anything with a face. %$* 13
for the motion, dr. %$* 13
neal barnard. %$* 13
he's a clinical researcher who studies the effect of diet on health. %$* 13
his partner is gene baur. %$* 13
he is president and co-founder of farm sanctuary. %$* 13
time magazine calls him the "conscience of the food movement." arguing against, chris masterjohn, who is a nutritional science researcher and proponent of the paleo diet. %$* 13
anybody on that? %$* 13
no, you don't have to raise your hand. %$* 13
oh, you raised your hand. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
let's all look. %$* 13
and joel salitan. %$* 13
he's the third generation alternative farmer who was made famous in michael pollan's bestseller "the omnivore's dilemma."next wednesday, november 20th, we're going to be in washington dc in partnership with the mccain institute. %$* 13
we're going to be debating this motion there-- %$* 13
"spy on me: i'd rather be safe." tickets for that are free. %$* 13
and if you get down to dc, come see us. %$* 13
and tickets for all of our remaining fall debates are available through our website, www.iq2us.org. %$* 13
if you can't join our live audience, of course, you can watch us on the live stream, as i believe a lot of people were doing tonight. %$* 13
and you can listen to all of our debates, including this one, on npr stations across the country. %$* 13
you can check your local listings for air dates and times, and you can hear yourself applaud. %$* 13
make sure to visit our website for up-to-date information and follow us on twitter and facebook. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
and by the way, we're always open to ideas for debate topics, so you can send those in. %$* 13
we just-- %$* 13
you know, think of something-- %$* 13
in terms of something that's really vital and that really is a dichotomy of views, and send it in. %$* 13
and we're very interested in hearing those. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
so, we have the final results in now. %$* 13
our motion is this: the constitutional right to bear arms has outlived its usefulness. %$* 13
the way we do this-- %$* 13
you've listened to the arguments. %$* 13
we had you vote before the debate and again after the debate. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers have changed the most in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so, here are the results. %$* 13
before the debate-- %$* 13
on the motion the constitutional right to bear arms has outlived its usefulness-- %$* 13
64 percent agreed with that motion. %$* 13
18 percent were against. %$* 13
and 18 percent were undecided. %$* 13
those were the first results. %$* 13
remember, you have to beat the-- %$* 13
your starting number by more percentage points than your opponents. %$* 13
here now are the results of the second vote. %$* 13
on the constitutional right to bear arms has outlived its usefulness, the team arguing for the motion-- %$* 13
their second vote was 74 percent. %$* 13
they went from 64 percent to 74 percent. %$* 13
they picked up 10 percent. %$* 13
that is the number to beat. %$* 13
against the motion, their vote-- %$* 13
now, their first vote was 18 percent. %$* 13
their second vote was 22 percent. %$* 13
that's up only four percentage points. %$* 13
it means the team arguing for the motion has narrowly won this debate: the constitutional right to bear arms has outlived its usefulness. %$* 13
that motion is carried. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
congratulations to all of our debaters, and thank you from me, john donvan, and intelligence squared u.s. we'll see you next time. %$* 13

and they're-- %$* 19
so and your point being that this undermines the-- %$* 13
what i'm saying is that-- %$* 19
jeffrey's argument that-- %$* 13
yeah, my question is that they don't really want to possibly annihilate the state of israel more than maybe change the nature of the regime so it becomes more multi-ethnic, would you agree to that? %$* 19
okay, jeffrey goldberg. %$* 13
israel is the homeland and state of the jewish people. %$* 428
they want to deny the jewish people their right to a jewish homeland and a jewish state. %$* 428
they threaten to use violence and use violence to do that. %$* 428
i'm sure some of ayatollah khamenei's best friends are jews. %$* 428
and i'm sure that people walk around the streets of tehran with kippot on. %$* 428
i would point out that, yes, there's a synagogue open in tehran, when natan sharansky and the refuseniks were in jail in the soviet union, there were five synagogues open in moscow. %$* 428
it's not relevant. %$* 428
the vast majority of iranian jews have fled the country. %$* 428
there was a population of 200,000.they're down to 25,000 now. %$* 428
it's not relevant. %$* 428
the iranian regime is very happy to have their jews living in protected second-class status, and that's the way that they like it. %$* 428
that's the iranian regime. %$* 428
the iranian people, by the way, are not anti- semitic on the whole, but the regime most definitely is. %$* 428
i can cite you quote, after quote, after quote to show you that they have-- %$* 428
they take almost an epidemiological-- %$* 428
they use epidemiological metaphors to talk about the curse of international jewry. %$* 428
you know, these are not people who want compromise on the west bank. %$* 428
these are people who want the jewish people denied their right to have a homeland in at least part of their historic homeland. %$* 428
there's a-- %$* 13
right in front of you, two rows back, there's a mike being handed up to you. %$* 13
there you go. %$* 13
all right, my name is william gravsky i just want to preface this by saying that as a young man i had an opportunity to study for a year at the hebrew university, very impressionable year. %$* 18
and recently i've had two opportunities to visit iran for conferences there. %$* 18
and the question is really that iran could be our natural ally-- %$* 18
is our natural ally in the region. %$* 18
you know, if there were 10 years of détente, the theocrats would be thrown out and there would be massive change. %$* 18
also the-- %$* 18
do you mean détente under a deterrent system? %$* 13
i mean, relationships, that what we did with the soviet union-- %$* 18
okay, i just want you to land this question in relation to our motion. %$* 13
so what-- %$* 18
the very-- %$* 18
so-- %$* 18
that these are not fixed entities, that things can change, and that our policies could result in massive change in the iranian regime, and that-- %$* 18
but in the-- %$* 18
a follow-up question is if there were a comprehensive settlement to the israeli- palestinian problem, wouldn't that also take the wind out of the sail of the iranian animosity-- %$* 18
and would-- %$* 13
and that anything that the palestinians-- %$* 18
and, sir, let me-- %$* 13
i just-- %$* 13
yeah. %$* 18
to-- %$* 13
i'm not disagreeing with you. %$* 13
you're asking this question, i'm asking you if you feel that you're-- %$* 13
would you amend it to say that even under a nuclear iran things could change, that times could-- %$* 13
the settlement of the israeli-palestinian conflict would render irrelevant iran's possession of the nuclear weapon as it relates to israel's survival? %$* 13
well, it wouldn't change the problem of the partly nuclear middle east. %$* 18
that would still be a problem. %$* 18
but it would change the dynamic. %$* 18
okay, you and i are debating now. %$* 13
i-- %$* 13
it would change the dynamic-- %$* 18
no, i don't mean to i just want you to put a focused question-- %$* 13
would it change the dynamics of their animosity towards israel? %$* 18
okay. %$* 13
shimuel bar. %$* 13
yes, i don't know, it seems-- %$* 427
i'm in this sort of cognitive dissonance here with some of those questions because i think sometimes i feel that i am living in a parallel world. %$* 427
i read what is written in iran. %$* 427
i read the material coming out of the iranian revolutionary guard. %$* 427
i have no doubt that most-- %$* 427
you know, iran is probably the most pro-american country in the middle east after israel, but it doesn't really matter, because, you know, you may have noticed that not everywhere in the world does the public opinion of the people rule the country. %$* 427
there are many, many countries in the world, not only north korea and places like that, where people may think one thing and the regime is something else. %$* 427
and the more dictatorial the regime is, and the easier it is to make sure that what people want isn't what they get. %$* 427
the iranian poet saadi once wrote that the sultan is evil and you must get rid of him and you must destroy him, but if you cannot kill him-- %$* 427
you cannot cut off his hand, kiss it. %$* 427
and this is basically what has happened to the revolution in iran. %$* 427
so-- %$* 427
to the green revolution. %$* 427
now, yes, it is possible that over a period of decades eventually iran will get back to being, you know, a friend of america, a friend of everybody, and was a friend of israel, was an ally of israel. %$* 427
but what happens in between? %$* 427
and what does a regime do when it has a nuclear weapon and it does everything in order to enhance its position and to make sure that by enhancing its position abroad it can also put down its opposition at home, because who would dare intervene in iran when iran can do that sort of mischief abroad? %$* 427
okay. %$* 13
do we have a question that will be directed towards this team? %$* 13
i only want to balance the talking time here. %$* 13
the far side. %$* 13
oh, actually, i'm sorry, i meant higher up. %$* 13
but go ahead and do that. %$* 13
go ahead, since-- %$* 13
you've talked a bit about the-- %$* 19
can you tell us your name? %$* 13
sorry. %$* 18
i'm so you've talked a bit about the opposition. %$* 18
i mean, about the, sort of, fundamentalist groups in lebanon and in palestine, hamas and hezbollah. %$* 18
what do you think about how this would affect the fight against mr. %$* 18
assad, in syria? %$* 18
and what do you think that the current situation in syria, where you have 100 of fragmented groups fighting against mr. %$* 18
assad-- %$* 18
you mean-- %$* 13
how do you think that that could affect israel? %$* 18
do you mean, iran's getting a nuclear weapon. %$* 13
how would that affect the situation in syria? %$* 13
yeah, how would that affect this situation and how could the combination of the two affect israel? %$* 18
given that syria is iran's basic-- %$* 13
only ally in the region. %$* 13
yes, and that syria shares a border with the u.-- %$* 18
with israel. %$* 18
good question. %$* 13
good question. %$* 426
but, to use their phrase, it's not relevant. %$* 426
sorry? %$* 13
it's not relevant to our debate what's going on in syria. %$* 426
i mean-- %$* 428
i mean, i-- %$* 428
hey, give the kid a break. %$* 13
sorry, sorry. %$* 426
jim dobbins. %$* 13
answer. %$* 13
i mean, i don't-- %$* 425
iran is already-- %$* 425
mic %$* 13
iran is already helping the assad regime. %$* 425
it would probably do so under those circumstances. %$* 425
i don't see why it would-- %$* 425
its help would be more efficacious because it had nuclear weapons. %$* 425
it's not going to threaten to use nuclear weapons against the iranian opposition, so i don't think it's likely to have a major impact. %$* 425
it might have some short-term psychological impact, but it-- %$* 425
you know, i mean, the united states successfully waged a war that got-- %$* 425
that three the soviet union out of afghanistan employing pakistani and afghan surrogates. %$* 425
the soviets had nuclear weapons, they were completely useless. %$* 425
they got defeated in afghanistan despite the fact that they had 24,000 nuclear weapons. %$* 425
i know it's an analogy. %$* 13
it's not an analogy, it's history. %$* 425
that's a pretty-- %$* 13
that's a pretty good analogy. %$* 13
no, no, the timeline-- %$* 427
shmuel bar. %$* 13
the timeline is-- %$* 427
you know, time is out of the assad regime is going to fall within half a year or so anyway, and iran is going to take over the northern part of-- %$* 427
no, but the part-- %$* 13
the part of what he said that i found interesting was how powerless the soviets were when they had nuclear weapons-- %$* 13
yes, but-- %$* 427
to win in afghanistan. %$* 13
because they-- %$* 427
you can't use a nuclear weapon in order to fight a war in afghanistan, it wasn't relevant to that. %$* 427
and in gaza? %$* 426
that's not the situation that we're talking about. %$* 427
we're talking about nation-states which have nuclear weapons and are posturing with nuclear weapons against each other and are going on nuclear alerts and are going into spirals of escalation. %$* 427
and this is what we're talking about; we're not talking about things like-- %$* 427
wars like the soviets waged in afghanistan. %$* 427
it's not relevant. %$* 427
why is-- %$* 425
why is what the united states did to the soviet union in afghanistan different from what iran is doing to israel in gaza? %$* 425
why is it different? %$* 425
it's exactly the same. %$* 425
you're supporting an insurgent pool against them-- %$* 425
and nuclear weapons were irrelevant. %$* 425
but why is it relevant to this? %$* 427
it isn't relevant. %$* 425
that's the point. %$* 425
the nuclear-- %$* 425
no, i mean-- %$* 427
weapons had no effect in either case. %$* 425
the why is it relevant thing is really getting old for me. %$* 13
okay. %$* 427
i find it relevant. %$* 13
and i'm neutral in this, but i find it an engaging thought. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 427
so the united states supported bin laden in afghanistan to help him kick out the soviets, that was a very good idea, i think it was really a marvelous idea, i'm sure that you're happy with that, you know, in retrospect. %$* 427
seemed like a good idea at the time. %$* 425
yeah, especially in this city. %$* 427
but what we're talking about here is the risk of iran acquiring a nuclear weapon against a series of countries, an array of countries which are going to have nuclear weapons as well, and not-- %$* 427
not the issue of how do you prevent a superpower with using limited conventional weaponry to invade a neighboring state, and then you use your own proxies against their proxies. %$* 427
it's a completely different game. %$* 427
right down in front here. %$* 13
just let the mic come to you. %$* 13
it's coming from behind you. %$* 13
and if you could stand up, please. %$* 13
yamashi i would like to reverse a question. %$* 18
how much longer do you think iran can live with a nuclear israel? %$* 18
that's not the debate tonight. %$* 13
i'm sorry. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
no, it's not a bad question. %$* 13
it's just that it's not going to move us forward. %$* 13
ma'am, on the far-- %$* 13
all the way towards the back there. %$* 13
third from the far row. %$* 13
hi. %$* 19
thank you so much. %$* 19
ma'am, could you stand? %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
my name is renee tambor i'd like to ask the panel how they would like to live with somebody next door who said they're going to kill you, and they have all the weapons, just as we have guns and so ongoing on here, people threatening to kill other people-- %$* 19
okay. %$* 13
again-- %$* 13
again, ma'am, i think-- %$* 13
excuse me. %$* 19
i think we've covered-- %$* 13
i think we've covered it with respect that part of the question, and i respect your passion, and i hear it. %$* 13
but i want to move on to a different topic. %$* 13
can i just change my question at this point? %$* 19
i'll change my question. %$* 19
you said how can you live with somebody next door to you who wants to kill you? %$* 13
and i-- %$* 13
and jeffrey made that point very relevantly. %$* 13
and with respect, if you could yield the mic. %$* 13
sir. %$* 13
thank you, fred baumgarten a question for mr. %$* 18
dobbins. %$* 18
you've talked about israel dealing with uncertainties rather than certainties. %$* 18
my question is, can you give us some metrics by which israel can calibrate an appropriate reaction and also, can you give us some historical examples of how other countries have dealt with existential threats and what levels of uncertainty has been acceptable versus a precursor to a swift response? %$* 18
so what are the red lines to living with a nuclear iran? %$* 13
jim dobbins? %$* 13
well, you know, i'm not sure that one can calculate exact levels of risk. %$* 425
i would certainly acknowledge that the risk of miscalculation and a nuclear exchange is higher if the countries have nuclear weapons than if they don't. %$* 425
it's high enough to be very concerned about. %$* 425
and so, going back to my proposition, israel shouldn't have to live with a nuclear iran if it has a better choice. %$* 425
i'm just arguing that there aren't better choices necessarily than those that we're already pursuing. %$* 425
i mean, i will get into whether it's relevant or not, but a whole literature on the concepts of deterrence, on means of deterrence, on mutual signaling, on avoiding escalatory instability by making sure that you weren't subject to a first strike, and thus tempting your adversary to make that first strike in rising tensions. %$* 425
there are ways that one can minimize the risk of escalation by the way one constructs and hides and disposes of one's nuclear forces. %$* 425
there are technical ways that one can avoid unauthorized use of these kinds of weapons. %$* 425
and there's a long history of literature on that. %$* 425
the united states, for instance, has sought to help pakistan establish physical mechanisms and procedures that would make an unauthorized or accidental launch of a nuclear weapon more difficult. %$* 425
i'm not suggesting we necessarily get into such a relationship with iran, but we might hope someone did. %$* 425
and that concludes round two of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
where our motion is israel can live with a nuclear iran. %$* 13
and we are about to move on to round three which will be brief closing statements from each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be two minutes each. %$* 13
and this is their last chance to try to influence your vote. %$* 13
immediately after their closing statements, we'll have our second vote. %$* 13
and remember, it's the team that has moved your numbers the most in the course of the debate who will be declared our winner. %$* 13
onto round three, closing statements. %$* 13
our motion is, israel can live with a nuclear iran. %$* 13
and here to summarize his position against the motion, jeffrey goldberg, national correspondent for the atlantic and columnist for bloomberg view. %$* 13
thank you, john. %$* 428
i want to just tell a very brief story. %$* 428
in 1998, i was in afghanistan, in kandahar when osama bin laden issued his first fatwa, the first big fatwa, the fatwa against crusaders and jews. %$* 428
and i was with a bunch of people, westerners, and we heard about this. %$* 428
and frankly, we laughed about it because it seemed crazy, absolutely insane, the audacity of it. %$* 428
and, you know, i learned three years later that very often when someone who says something that seems crazy, says it over and over again, that it's worth paying attention to. %$* 428
and so on my visits to iran, and i've been there a few times, i've talked to people in the regime about these subjects. %$* 428
i'll tell you one very brief encounter i had with a guy named mohammed ali samadi who was a leader of a group called the seekers of martyrdom, which actually sounds like a great name for a band, actually. %$* 428
but their job at the time was to try to figure out how to kill salman rushdie. %$* 428
and-- %$* 428
but i talked to him about israel. %$* 428
and he said the following, which has always stayed with me. %$* 428
there are always infections and diseases in man. %$* 428
in the world, there is an infection called international jewry. %$* 428
and i listened to him, and i listened to various leaders of the regime. %$* 428
and i have decided to take them seriously. %$* 428
i think in the post 9/11 age, we have to take religious fundamentalists who say they want to kill you seriously. %$* 428
i think it is possible to overlearn the lessons of jewish history, to overlearn the lessons of the holocaust. %$* 428
but i'm even more afraid of underlearning the lessons of jewish history. %$* 428
i believe that the iranian regime is serious about wanting to find a way to destroy the state of israel. %$* 428
i believe that if they get a nuclear weapon, they will go a great distance to achieving that goal. %$* 428
and therefore, i ask you to vote against this resolution, vote against this motion. %$* 428
thank you. %$* 428
thank you, jeffrey goldberg. %$* 13
our motion is israel can live with a nuclear iran. %$* 13
and here to summarize his position in support of the motion, reuven pedatzur, a senior military affairs analyst with haaretz. %$* 13
thank you, unfortunately, all the arguments that we have raised were irrelevant. %$* 426
so i tried. %$* 426
anyway, i understand the arguments of the other side. %$* 426
it's very frightening to live under this shade of this hostile regime with nuclear weapons. %$* 426
i have no illusions. %$* 426
the ayatollahs are not lovers of zion. %$* 426
but they are very rational, and they want to survive, and they want to their country. %$* 426
and at the end, they are not going to use the weapons. %$* 426
we can live with nuclear iran. %$* 426
i live in tel aviv. %$* 426
this is the center of the target. %$* 426
and i didn't ask my four daughters and my grandchildren to leave israel, because i believe that we can live in israel and survive more than three years. %$* 426
in the '50s, at the end of the '50s when there was the threat of the soviet union, people in the states started building atomic shelters in their back yards. %$* 426
and kennedy ran for president promising that he is going to build atomic shelters for the whole population. %$* 426
i hope that we are not going to start building atomic shelters in tel aviv. %$* 426
a nuclear iran is not the end of zionism. %$* 426
thank you. %$* 426
thank you, reuven pedatzur. %$* 13
our motion is israel can live with a nuclear iran. %$* 13
and here, summarizing his position against the motion shmuel bar. %$* 13
he is director of studies at the institute of policy and strategy in herzliya, israel. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 427
i want to just reiterate that rationality of every single individual involved in a conflict is not a guarantee that the conflict will end or will develop in a rational manner or in a way which everybody will be happy with. %$* 427
in the end, history shows us that a lot of things happened which everybody's sorry about, that it's bad for everybody. %$* 427
now, you know, we talk about the cuban missile crisis, et cetera. %$* 427
actually, during the cuban missile crisis, all of these rational people were very, very close to armageddon, which was, according to the capabilities of that period. %$* 427
during the cold war, there were a number of instances where the united states and the soviet union, with all of their command and control capabilities, with all of their intelligence, actually came to some very, very dangerous points, which were avoided because the leaderships had a means of communication. %$* 427
now, the level of hostility in the middle east does not augur well for direct communications between-- %$* 427
not even-- %$* 427
not only israel-iran, but iran-saudi arabia, and we're talking about a middle east in which countries are falling apart, and that some countries may acquire the nuclear weapons that they will inherit from the countries which are disintegrating. %$* 427
we're talking about a region which is-- %$* 427
i call this the "humpty dumpty stage," that they're falling apart and nobody would put them together again-- %$* 427
this is a very dangerous area to have nuclear weapons. %$* 427
ultimately, the question is not, "well, can you do anything about it? %$* 427
if you can't do anything about it, live with it," but "you have to do something about it. %$* 427
you've got to find a way." and, believe me, there are more than one ways to skin a cat, even a persian cat. %$* 427
thank you, shmuel bar. %$* 13
the motion, "israel can live with a nuclear iran," and here to summarize his position in support of the motion, james dobbins. %$* 13
he's director of the international security and defense policy center at rand. %$* 13
well, i'm old enough to remember when in elementary school we were taught to hide under our desks under nuclear attack. %$* 425
duck and cover. %$* 426
duck and cover. %$* 425
and, you know, sirens would go off, and we would hide under our desks, so, you know, some level of fear and concern is natural enough in a society that faces that kind of threat. %$* 425
and if you can avoid the threat, by all means, do so if you have a better choice. %$* 425
we didn't have a better choice at the time. %$* 425
reuven has suggested that a nuclear iran will not be the end of the jewish state. %$* 425
and i'd have to say most israelis agree with him. %$* 425
the times of israel published a poll last week, a poll done in the context of their election campaign, in which they asked the israeli populace what were the issues that most-- %$* 425
that created most anxiety, what were they most worried about. %$* 425
was iran the number one issue? %$* 425
no. %$* 425
economic issues were their dominant concern. %$* 425
was iran the number two issue? %$* 425
no. %$* 425
actually, and perhaps rather healthily, the deterioration in relations with the palestinians was the number two concern. %$* 425
was iran the number three concern? %$* 425
no. %$* 425
the third concern was the state of their education system. %$* 425
iran was the fourth in this list of six, with 12 percent of the israeli population thinking that the iranian threat was their principal concern. %$* 425
well, i'm old enough to remember when in elementary school we were taught to hide under our desks under nuclear attack. %$* 425
thank you, james dobbins. %$* 13
and that concludes our closing statements. %$* 13
and now it's time to learn which side you feel argued the best this evening. %$* 13
we're asking you again to go to the keypads at your seat as you did at the beginning of the debate. %$* 13
the motion, "israel can live with a nuclear iran," if after hearing the debate you've been moved to this side or stayed at this side, press number one. %$* 13
if your position is or became against, push number two. %$* 13
and if you remained or became undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and if you think you pushed a key incorrectly, just correct yourself and the system will only record your last vote. %$* 13
and we'll have the results of that vote in just about a minute. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
before we do that, i want to do this. %$* 13
it's a contentious topic tonight. %$* 13
i think it was done in a very, very civil and constructive way. %$* 13
certain things were declared irrelevant repeatedly. %$* 13
and maybe they were, but i want to congratulate our debaters for the quality of debate-- %$* 13
also want to thank people who asked questions this evening, and that includes the questions that i did not take. %$* 13
i want to make it clear that if i pass on a question it is not meant as a disrespect in any way or a sign that the question is invalid or unsound. %$* 13
i particularly liked your question. %$* 13
in fact, about-- %$* 13
what is their-- %$* 13
iran going to do about nuclear israel? %$* 13
someday we're going to have that debate. %$* 13
i know you feel it's relevant, that's why you asked it, but i have to make a judgment call on that, and the woman who expressed her passion about living next door to a neighbor who wants to kill you, i totally respect that, and there is no disrespect intended in passing on the question. %$* 13
i just felt that we had covered it. %$* 13
but i basically want to say let's give a round of applause to everybody with the nerve to get up and ask a question tonight. %$* 13
so thank you for tolerating my occasionally vanishing laryngitic voice tonight. %$* 13
it will be better at the next debate, which will be wednesday, february 13th. %$* 13
we will be looking at this motion: prohibit genetically engineered babies. %$* 13
it's based on the fact that we already screen for genetic diseases, and the ability to choose a child's color and intelligence is, actually, not so far off. %$* 13
we want to look, basically, at the policy and the ethics implied in that manifestation of a brave new world. %$* 13
our debaters will include, for the motion, arguing to prohibit: sheldon krimsky. %$* 13
he is the chair of the center for responsible genetics and professor of humanities and social sciences at tufts university. %$* 13
he will be partnered with lord robert winston. %$* 13
he is a pioneer in fertility and ivf treatment and professor of science and society at imperial college. %$* 13
arguing against: nita farahany. %$* 13
she is a professor of law and genome sciences at duke, also a member of the presidential commission for the study of bioethical issues. %$* 13
and her partner will be lee silver. %$* 13
and lee silver is a professor of molecular biology and public policy at princeton university. %$* 13

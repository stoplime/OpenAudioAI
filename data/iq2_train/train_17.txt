lawrence o’donnell. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 187
do i really have seven minutes? %$* 187
because, you know, on msnbc, i never get out more than a sentence and a half before pat buchanan interrupts me, so i don’t know that i have seven minutes. %$* 187
i had some prepared material, which i will use some of. %$* 187
but i would like to very quickly go through some of the points that you have heard from the presenters of this preposterous idea. %$* 187
i want to though give you the correct concept that you are aiming for here, in that, in the title of this proposition, is it the first, the first failed state? %$* 187
what that means is, is it the worst of 50 states? %$* 187
all this side has to do—all it has to do—is give you the idea that there might be somewhere the 50 states somewhere %$* 187
one—one—that’s doing something worse than california %$* 187
or maybe doing everything worse than california. %$* 187
and oh, by the way, might also be a slightly less desirable place to live. %$* 187
that’s our chore. %$* 187
we have to find you one that you don’t want to live in. %$* 187
and you know, the proposition was defined by andreas at the beginning. %$* 187
he had to admit that it was a cheeky proposition. %$* 187
the backing off from the strength of the declaration and the proposition. %$* 187
he mentioned recidivism rates in california prisons—they are not good. %$* 187
crime is down, does that count? %$* 187
does it matter that in los angeles crime is down dramatically because the mayor had the wisdom to import the police commissioner that rudy giuliani, rudy giuliani’s ego couldn’t stand in this city, bill bratton? %$* 187
bill bratton came out to l.a. in the process %$* 187
and through an exercise of government—local government and local police work—got that crime rate down dramatically, as he did here. %$* 187
you will hear about different problems. %$* 187
you will hear bobby talking about the homeless. %$* 187
that’s important. %$* 187
that is, that is tragic. %$* 187
but remember what the case is here. %$* 187
the case is, is it somehow a california issue? %$* 187
is what bobby talked about a california issue? %$* 187
california has more homeless people than any other state. %$* 187
it has more wealth than any other state. %$* 187
it has more poverty than any other state. %$* 187
it has more agricultural production than any other state. %$* 187
it has more people. %$* 187
it has more. %$* 187
every single thing they will tell you about anecdotally—yes, california has the most of it. %$* 187
but as we sit here in the lower end of manhattan, is it conceivable %$* 187
is it conceivable that a homeless person has died in gruesome circumstances, in gruesome circumstances in this zip code, ever? %$* 187
or maybe, how often? %$* 187
is that the question for this zip code? %$* 187
you know, sharon mentions getting around is difficult. %$* 187
the traffic is hard. %$* 187
it is hard. %$* 187
it’s hard to get your car to a dodgers game from santa monica, where sharon and i live, that is true. %$* 187
what time do you have to leave to get a 7:00 p.m. flight from jfk? %$* 187
from here. %$* 187
not from up in the upper west side, where it’s even more difficult. %$* 187
but what time %$* 187
when would you leave? %$* 187
3:00? %$* 187
i mean, you know, factor in some security issues at the airport %$* 187
i don’t take 7:00 p.m.flights from jfk, because i can’t get there. %$* 187
it’s just not going to work—i am going to have to surrender too much of the day. %$* 187
the budget cuts in the university system, budget cuts— educational budget cuts have been mentioned. %$* 187
take your time. %$* 187
take all the time you need to come up with the name of a better public university—not in the 50 states, in the world—a better public university than the university of california at berkeley. %$* 187
take your time. %$* 187
we have all night. %$* 187
the delicious irony %$* 187
the delicious irony of having this debate %$* 187
in this state %$* 187
today’s local paper, the new york times, in its seemingly endless editorial series called “the failed state.” it stars—as usual—albany. %$* 187
they have %$* 187
this one happens to be about the ethics bill that they are %$* 187
the improvement in the ethics program that they are trying to introduce in albany. %$* 187
utterly hopeless. %$* 187
you would think there would be some momentum for that—after joe bruno gets convicted, of actually running businesses out of his office and all other sorts of illegalities— there would be some momentum for it. %$* 187
it’s hopeless, it won’t happen. %$* 187
you don’t know what the outside income is of your state legislators—and you don’t know it by law. %$* 187
so when you want to have this debate about failed states and failed state governments—with the state legislature that you have—having it here is cheeky. %$* 187
i lived here longer than i have lived in los angeles. %$* 187
i worked in government with senator moynihan. %$* 187
very much concerned with issues facing this state. %$* 187
very much concerned with its fair share, for example. %$* 187
the problem %$* 187
and what we discovered %$* 187
and what we harped on endlessly back in the ‘80s and ‘90s was new york sends more money to the federal government than it gets back— hence, all of its budget problems. %$* 187
well, the problem is much worse in california. %$* 187
california gets 79 cents back for every dollar that it sends to the federal government. %$* 187
so the reason you don’t have 40 other so-called failed states is because california tax money is paying for alabama, it’s paying to keep alaska running, it’s paying to keep arkansas afloat. %$* 187
you can’t balance any of the books in those states without the money that comes out of california pockets to fund it. %$* 187
there is much more to be said about this. %$* 187
i am running out of time to do it. %$* 187
i didn’t think i had six minutes %$* 187
seven minutes, thank you. %$* 187
thank you, lawrence o’donnell. %$* 13
and that concludes round 1 of this intelligence squared debate. %$* 13
this is a debate from intelligence squared u.s.i am john donvan of abc news, serving as moderator. %$* 13
and our motion is “california is the first failed state.” we asked you in the audience—who will be serving as our ultimate judges—before the debate began %$* 13
to tell us where you stood on this issue. %$* 13
we had you all vote. %$* 13
i now have the first results of that vote, and we do have a contest. %$* 13
before the debate, on the motion “california is the first failed state,” 31 percent of you were for the motion, 25 percent against, and 44 percent are undecided. %$* 13
so it’s really wide open. %$* 13
now moving on to round 2.and in round 2, the debaters address each other directly, and they also take questions from myself and from you in the audience. %$* 13
when i come to you in the audience—which will be in a few minutes— if you raise your hand, i will find you. %$* 13
and we would like you to rise. %$* 13
if you are a member of the news media, we would appreciate it if you would identify yourself as such. %$* 13
and when you take the microphone, hold it about a fist’s amount away from where you are speaking, so that the npr stations can hear you clearly, as well as bloomberg. %$* 13
and i really want to urge you to keep the questions to 30 seconds, and really to make them questions. %$* 13
don’t argue with the panel. %$* 13
questions, with a question mark at the end of it. %$* 13
round 1, our middle round. %$* 13
and i begin with the question to the team that is arguing that california is the first failed state. %$* 13
you have been making an argument—primarily, not entirely—but primarily that the failure of the state of california is largely a political failure, the failure of the political system leading to gridlock, and as a result, lack of services. %$* 13
the other team is arguing about %$* 13
they are listing several kinds of successes. %$* 13
they are listing successes in innovation, and in technology, and in the development of greening the state, and stem cells, and personal connections, political connections on the small scale. %$* 13
they are coming back at you with success. %$* 13
andreas, clearly, of the economist, well, what’s wrong with that argument? %$* 13
well, in particular, governor gray davis was making that point. %$* 182
i wrote down a direct quote from you, governor, “in california, the private sector is the envy of the world. %$* 182
the public sector is on the mend.” you asked me, “what’s wrong with the logic of the first part? %$* 182
” and in fact, i would like to do that, and the second part as well. %$* 182
and we examined the first part, and go and take a larger period of history—a few hundred years. %$* 182
the most elegant leather shoes come from a town nearly bologna in northern italy. %$* 182
the best violins come from another town in northern italy. %$* 182
that’s been that way for hundreds of years. %$* 182
would you honestly make the case %$* 182
would you have made the case for much of post-war history that italy was not a failed state in the european union because they had a great shoe industry and a great violin industry in the northern italy? %$* 182
gray davis, do respond. %$* 13
it is irrelevant. %$* 182
the other point—just briefly. %$* 182
you cannot seriously say that the public sector is on the mend—at the very moment when they are dismantling entire government programs that were intended to protect the weakest. %$* 182
and people are literally going to die, certain old people at home, because home visits are stopping. %$* 182
andreas, let’s now have gray davis respond to your first point. %$* 13
the state is not an abstraction. %$* 183
it is the sum total of the energy, the vibrancy, the creativity and the innovation of 37 million people. %$* 183
it is an exciting place to live because when we have problems, we don’t moan and groan. %$* 183
we don’t bemoan our fate. %$* 183
we say, we are going to solve it, we are going to figure it out, we are going to do something different. %$* 183
so for andreas to dismiss all the energy, the excitement, the creativity that is producing the iphone and the social networking, and alternative energy, we %$* 183
my god, we have got exxonmobil investing 600 million dollars into a san diego project that will turn algae into oil. %$* 183
i mean, if that’s not the establishment saying you are doing something smart in california, i don’t know what that’s about. %$* 183
now to say that’s not part of the state, to say that the state is just some civil servants and some black boxes, we don’t know anything about it. %$* 183
the state are human beings, getting up every day, doing their best to make the world a better place. %$* 183
expecting to succeed, frequently succeeding, but realizing that risk takers though they are, failure will eventually %$* 183
well, failure will occasionally occur. %$* 183
governor, did you say 60 million %$* 184
wait, let me just %$* 183
or 60 billion? %$* 184
i just want to point out %$* 184
let me just say this %$* 183
that failure will occur occasionally when you take risk. %$* 183
but they don’t see failure as the end of the journey—they see it as an occasional stop on the road to success. %$* 183
that’s what separates california from a lot of other parts of the world. %$* 183
and that’s why it is—and will continue to be—a successful state, despite what is happening in sacramento. %$* 183
sharon waxman. %$* 13
yeah, i had a question. %$* 184
exxonmobil, you say was 60 million dollars in san diego? %$* 184
600 million dollars %$* 183
600 million dollars %$* 184
in an algae to oil project. %$* 183
right, ok. so the last quarterly statement for exxonmobil, they were %$* 184
their profits were in the multiple billions of dollars. %$* 184
so in terms of their investments %$* 184
and that’s a small multiple for %$* 184
yeah, but algae to oil %$* 183
for a company like %$* 184
and they are %$* 183
and we are looking into algae and oil in new york? %$* 183
are we looking to algae and oil in kansas? %$* 183
are we looking to algae and oil in mississippi? %$* 183
they are in nevada and arizona %$* 182
andreas kluth. %$* 13
and especially—if you want to talk about the green economy— look to denmark, china, israel %$* 182
well, wait %$* 183
yeah, and it’s not in california %$* 182
andreas, let me, in your article %$* 183
governor %$* 13
in your article %$* 183
actually, i limit it to the united states. %$* 182
gray davis? %$* 13
do we have %$* 187
i just want to make one point %$* 13
do i understand %$* 187
we just have to find one state that %$* 187
well, lawrence %$* 13
well, one state. %$* 182
that runs from oil to algae %$* 187
lawrence, lawrence %$* 13
if there is one state that’s doing less %$* 187
lawrence %$* 13
on oil to algae, we win. %$* 187
lawrence, i just %$* 13
i just want to make one point %$* 13
i am going to refer to governor davis as gray davis throughout the debate, not out of any disrespect for the office, but because in the debates we keep everything on a first name basis, and i want to make sure that is clear. %$* 13
no disrespect is intended, and i hope nobody takes it that way. %$* 13
and lawrence, i was talking all over you. %$* 13
and it looked great, so go at it again. %$* 13
well, you know, you are going to hear a lot about budget cutting and they are going to %$* 187
you know, they are going to have to cut back on home healthcare visits and things like that. %$* 187
there are 43 states—43 states—that have cut their enacted budgets of 2009. they enacted budgets for 2009, they have—43 of them went back and cut them, ok? %$* 187
tomorrow’s newspaper will reveal to you that the governor’s latest idea—your governor’s, new york governor’s, latest idea—is the largest cut in school aid in more than two decades. %$* 187
that’s the latest idea for how to get things going correctly in albany. %$* 187
and now in searching for new areas of revenue so they don’t have to cut quite so much money, the brilliant idea that your governor here in new york is proposing is—to legalize ultimate fighting. %$* 187
congratulations. %$* 187
bobby shriver? %$* 13
i just %$* 186
and since lawrence is so funny and so experienced, i just have to do a few little, catch-ups here. %$* 186
they don’t win if there is another failed state. %$* 186
that’s not true. %$* 186
it, it’s whether this is the first failed state. %$* 186
so he would have to say that new—and which he was actually saying %$* 186
that new york was first. %$* 13
right here in new york—that new york is the first failed state. %$* 186
maybe that would give him a little bit of a point. %$* 186
but i %$* 186
lawrence, i think he has got you on that one %$* 13
i really don’t think that that’s what it is. %$* 186
let me do a couple of things. %$* 186
berkeley is a great university. %$* 186
do you know what it costs to go to berkeley a year? %$* 186
who knows? %$* 186
30-plus thousand dollars a year. %$* 186
oh my. %$* 137
is that a public university? %$* 186
it’s owned by the public, but when you say “find a better one than berkeley %$* 186
” that’s not a public university. %$* 186
the original act that created berkeley %$* 186
you went to berkeley free. %$* 186
free is public. %$* 186
free is the community. %$* 186
30,000 dollars of after-tax money—per year—is not free. %$* 186
that’s not %$* 186
bobby, that %$* 183
bobby, that’s %$* 183
just, just %$* 186
can i make one other %$* 186
well, that isn’t right %$* 183
well, let’s let gray davis comment. %$* 13
the under %$* 183
the fees have gone up. %$* 183
as governor, i opposed every fee. %$* 183
but the fee to be an undergraduate in berkeley this year is 10,000 dollars. %$* 183
ok.well then, i am wrong. %$* 186
i read that it was %$* 186
undergraduate. %$* 183
in the l.a. times %$* 186
the graduate schools %$* 183
then it was lies %$* 186
the graduate schools of law and business—for several years— have been allowed to float up. %$* 183
and they are—as sharon suggested—25, 30 thousand dollars. %$* 183
but ph.d.candidates are very low. %$* 183
so it’s still a %$* 183
it’s higher than it should be, but it’s still terrific compared to other alternatives available to students %$* 183
but when you have a student revolt for this %$* 184
let me just stop for a second. %$* 186
you do have a student revolt, but i just %$* 186
that’s true. %$* 184
and i got the number from the l.a. times, so %$* 186
and this is after the new editions, so maybe that’s wrong %$* 186
even to me, at 10 grand, it’s %$* 186
for a people who have modest incomes %$* 186
i agree. %$* 183
and i totally agree with you %$* 183
10 grand of after-tax money %$* 186
that it’s not fair to them. %$* 183
is a real thing. %$* 186
the second thing is: i think if you support— which i do too—a constitutional convention, your %$* 186
when did people have constitutional conventions? %$* 186
the national constitutional convention was %$* 186
when there was a big ol’ mess at hand. %$* 186
you don’t have a constitutional convention when things are going great. %$* 186
so if you support %$* 186
right? %$* 186
right? %$* 186
so if you support %$* 186
all right, stop. %$* 13
well, let me %$* 13
and let me %$* 13
and let me, and let me, and let me just say. %$* 186
if you support a constitutional convention—and i think you should ask all three of these gentlemen whether they support it or not—. %$* 186
uh-huh. %$* 13
—they have to lose, because now you %$* 186
you don’t have %$* 186
van jones. %$* 13
a constitutional convention %$* 186
i would love to bring in van jones %$* 13
in a successful—or a less than failed state—. %$* 186
van jones is part of the weekend summit %$* 13
well, the rules change by the minute here %$* 187
yeah. %$* 185
exactly. %$* 185
well %$* 185
first of all %$* 185
oh yeah. %$* 186
you are conceding the point—which is that we have, in california, the tools to continue to solve these problems. %$* 185
one of the things that is so exciting about the state of california is that people who have ideas get a chance to actually act on them— maybe to excess at this point. %$* 185
and i would have no problem with rolling back some of the detritus as it accumulates on our constitution. %$* 185
but we actually have the problem solvers, and the tools to solve the problems. %$* 185
and when you say you have a failed state—which you are, and which you are suggesting. %$* 185
first of all, you are trying to take off the table the economic successes. %$* 185
the economic successes are a function—especially in the clean tech area—of policy successes, of political successes. %$* 185
we have been able to put aside partisan differences on one question, which is: if we are going to have the jobs of tomorrow in california, we have got to have the technology of tomorrow %$* 185
make the products of tomorrow %$* 185
and we have been able to get that done. %$* 185
and that sets the table for the forward motion that you are talking about. %$* 185
so when you try and take off the table %$* 185
it’s striking to me. %$* 185
i have never heard of a failed state where the eighth largest economy in the world %$* 185
i have never heard of a failed state that is literally one-eighth of the output for the entire country. %$* 185
california is to the rest of the country what germany is to the eu.and i don’t hear anybody calling germany a failed state, whatever problems they may be, that may be there. %$* 185
and so i think again, you are conceding—when you talk about the fact that we are talking about a constitutional convention, and we are talking about a whole raft—that california forward and other folks are talking about a whole raft of fixes—we have got the tools and the innovation and the determination to fix the problems in california. %$* 185
so you are saying %$* 13
and so we are not a failed state. %$* 185
so you are saying then that the existence of an ambulance team, means that the hospital is basically not shut down quite yet? %$* 13
well, well %$* 185
if you want to go with that %$* 185
if you want to go with that analogy %$* 185
i am saying that the patient is not dead. %$* 185
ok. %$* 13
and that’s what these guys are trying to do %$* 185
but that’s %$* 13
i think that’s a valid %$* 13
actually quite cogent argument. %$* 13
andreas, can you take that on? %$* 13
sure. %$* 182
so if you say if you want to change it to california is dead %$* 182
and i can tell you we are not debating that, and we are not arguing it %$* 182
yeah. %$* 13
what we are %$* 182
by the way, i agree that failure—as you said—is an occasional stop. %$* 182
i happen to be writing a book at the moment about how failure and success are imposters. %$* 182
but you have to be honest that a failure has occurred, in order to fix it. %$* 182
californians are honest about it—that’s why they will pass the two initiatives that will call for a constitutional convention—just as americans, after the revolutionary war, called a constitutional convention because the articles of confederation were a failure, and they accepted that and admitted that first, and then you start fresh. %$* 182
so you need to admit honestly that a failure has occurred %$* 182
then you move on, move on. %$* 182
a few %$* 182
just a little bit of mopping up. %$* 182
about the public universities. %$* 182
what is the still remaining excellence of the university system a sign of? %$* 182
it’s a sign of the pat brown legacy, when california was not a failed state. %$* 182
what are they dismantling? %$* 182
i wrote a story about this. %$* 182
i asked professors and the president of the uc system. %$* 182
a professor at uc santa cruz of astrophysics told me %$* 182
the excellence is being lost in her department as we speak because of the budget cuts. %$* 182
the people she was hiring to be good professors have defected because they know there is nowhere for them to go in their careers. %$* 182
they are going to more competitive, private or other public universities in the state and world. %$* 182
so don’t get confused about this public university. %$* 182
it was a sign of something working well 30 years ago %$* 182
and you are %$* 182
you will see—when it’s gone—that something failed today. %$* 182
and we will patiently await your naming of the state that spends more on its university system. %$* 187
on a per-capita basis? %$* 186
spends more on its university system. %$* 187
no, that’s %$* 184
exactly. %$* 184
he kinda misses %$* 186
he kinda missed that %$* 186
i want to go to the audience for questions now. %$* 13
and again, raise your hand, i’ll find you. %$* 13
a microphone to your mouth. %$* 13
there is a woman i think in the gray sweater, right? %$* 13
yes, that’s right. %$* 13
and ma’am, it’s easier for us—and so for the camera to see you—if you stand up %$* 13
ok. %$* 137
and hold that mic close and make a good question %$* 13
well, sure. %$* 137
i am sorry? %$* 137
no one here has raised, the issue of what was passed in 1979—and that was a proposition where basically, negated the state from raising any tax revenues to feed everything that you are talking about, whether it’s schools, public universities, services, art, what have you. %$* 137
and i would ask van jones, let’s start with you. %$* 137
great that we have clean tech and we have the private industry and we have capitalism and competition. %$* 137
but if you don’t have the public monies to support initiatives, where do you get it? %$* 137
do you tax the capitalists? %$* 137
question mark, very good. %$* 13
van jones? %$* 13
well %$* 185
the problem in california isn’t primarily a revenue problem. %$* 185
i mean, there are %$* 185
we had a courageous governor, frankly, who was willing to do what needed to be done with regard to the so-called car tax. %$* 185
and the five billion dollars was on the table, and that’s off the table. %$* 185
and we are the only state, in california %$* 185
the only oil producing state in the country that doesn’t tax the oil when it comes out of the ground. %$* 185
it is a billion dollars a year %$* 185
there are revenue sources that are available. %$* 185
the problem in california right now is—which is why we are here—is that we haven’t agreed on the vision for california going forward. %$* 185
hmmm. %$* 13
now, a crisis of vision is an opportunity. %$* 185
and that is %$* 185
well, and that’s really, i think, what you are seeing in california. %$* 185
people now—and a critical mass of people—are trying to figure out how we go forward %$* 185
i think obviously prop 13, from my point of view, it has been disastrous for the state of california. %$* 185
i think it’s not all taxes, but it is property taxes. %$* 185
and what it’s done is, it has put the state on this yo-yo of tax income based on income tax and other sources of revenue %$* 185
we would have done better, i think, if we had a little bit more opportunity to have a property tax regime in place. %$* 185
and also the other problem with proposition 13—which was raised—is that it would %$* 185
it requires two-thirds of the legislature to agree to any tax increase. %$* 185
and in california, that’s a very, very difficult thing to do given where the republican party is. %$* 185
but what i would say is simply this: we have an abundance of opportunity in the state of california, because of the success of not just our clean energy—we brag on our clean tech because we are so proud of it—but we have nine different regional economies. %$* 185
which gives us the ability to do what countries do, frankly. %$* 185
we have an agricultural region %$* 185
we have, manufacturing, etc. %$* 185
and i think that where we are—at this stage in the development of california’s economy—is we will fix the tax structure, we will fix the budgeting structure. %$* 185
and we have already got redistricting done. %$* 185
and then, anybody who bets against california right now, is going to lose an awful lot of money. %$* 185
another question? %$* 13
and would you like to respond, to respond on this side before i go to a question? %$* 13
i would like, i would like to start %$* 184
oh, this is sharon waxman. %$* 13
oh yeah. %$* 184
i would like to not respond %$* 184
i would like to ask %$* 184
and clean tech is %$* 184
and we keep hearing clean tech, clean tech %$* 184
how about the industry that i brought up—hollywood—where that is, that is just the subject of the most egregious neglect in the years that i have been covering the industry. %$* 184
this is a huge amount of money that the state has just allowed to leave. %$* 184
and only this past year has there been the tiniest, too little too late measure to keep it together %$* 184
by passing a small fraction of the kinds of measures that other states have already had in place for years to incentivize productions to stay in the state. %$* 184
that’s money %$* 184
that’s not money that’s out there to be created, as clean tech is a future and building, an economy of where we are going %$* 184
it’s an industry that’s there, that the state has allowed to slip through its fingers, and has never actually created a sense of—as i keep using that word—connection between the people %$* 184
yeah, how %$* 184
i mean, california invented the motion picture industry. %$* 184
it created %$* 184
it invented the entertainment industry. %$* 184
how is it possible that it has been allowed to slip away? %$* 184
well, that’s a very simple question. %$* 187
and what sharon is talking about %$* 187
lawrence o’donnell. %$* 13
is what in california is referred to as runaway production. %$* 187
a show like the west wing, for example, was shot on a sound stage at warner brothers, and we would go to washington a couple of times a year and pick up some exteriors. %$* 187
dick wolf, who shoots law and order—the most successful show on television in terms of longevity and ratings—wanted higher production values than that, he wanted his cameras to be able to go on the streets of new york every day. %$* 187
and where would you suggest shooting the sopranos. %$* 187
do you think maybe we should do that on a back lot at universal, you think we can just get the palm trees out of the way and give you the right feel, by moving the sopranos out there? %$* 187
what’s happened is the artists involved in this giant industry which is thriving, which has had its biggest box-office year of all time this year, in a recession, the artists are looking for higher production values and opportunities to shoot in places that were never available before. %$* 187
you couldn’t shoot in prague %$* 187
25 years ago if you wanted to. %$* 187
lawrence— %$* 13
you can now— %$* 187
—do—so, you’re basically saying that the migration of the industry has nothing to do with the management of the state. %$* 13
that’s— %$* 13
it has absolutely nothing to do with the management of the state— %$* 187
that’s absolutely false— %$* 184
—nothing— %$* 187
—and you know it. %$* 184
the taxes— that’s completely empirically false. %$* 184
canada, london, 20 percent tax credits, it’s not the artists who make the decisions as you know, dick wolf is an exception, he’s not the artist in that case, he’s the executive producer. %$* 184
but it’s the producers and it’s the people who sign the checks who decide where these jobs go. %$* 184
i’m declaring—i’m declaring impasse on the hollywood question— %$* 13
what you’re advocating is a tax hike— %$* 187
i’d like to go to another question— %$* 13
—for movie producers in california— %$* 187
to, um %$* 13
i haven’t come to this side, this gentleman in a blue shirt, sir, you— you have to stand up, thanks. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 9
first of all, i, i think that the dwelling on the word “first” in the “first failed state” is honestly frivolous. %$* 9
i’d like to pose though to governor davis, i was a san francisco for 15 years and, and i arrived %$* 9
feeling very, very excited about the idea of direct democracy. %$* 9
and it seems like we’re avoiding that topic because in—to my mind, it is the very prevalence of direct democracy that is ruining california and ruining california’s political system. %$* 9
and— %$* 9
can you formulate this as a question. %$* 13
how do we fix the direct democracy problem in california— %$* 9
okay— %$* 13
—as somebody who was an elected official— %$* 9
i think everybody’s nodding on this one, i’d like to go to andreas and andreas, in, in 14 seconds— %$* 13
well, wait a minute— %$* 183
—remind—remind— %$* 13
question was put to me. %$* 183
was it—? %$* 13
i feel like— %$* 183
was it— %$* 13
—reagan saying mr. %$* 183
green, this is my microphone. %$* 183
i’m sorry. %$* 13
i’m answering— %$* 183
i—i apologize, gray davis, i had a moderator lapse— %$* 13
and i—i can speak— %$* 183
i just want to ask you— %$* 13
—with authority on direct democracy because i am a victim of it as well as a— %$* 183
can you—governor, can you %$* 13
can you take 10 seconds for the people who missed civics class that day %$* 13
10 seconds— %$* 13
i can’t answer in— %$* 183
—to remind us of what direct democracy involved— %$* 13
direct democracy in california basically means that, all issues get to the voters sooner or later, and if they don’t get to them sooner the voters put an initiative on the ballot and take matters into their own hands. %$* 183
and basically, everything of consequence gets decided by the voters. %$* 183
and i think they make basically good decisions, i won an awful lot of elections, i lost my last election. %$* 183
but that doesn’t mean, people didn’t have a reason to want to change. %$* 183
what it does mean, however, is they have the power, and i would suggest, in our system of special interests, the only people who have the power to improve things in sacramento. %$* 183
they’ve already improved them, by changing the way legislators draw—legislators will never— no longer draw the districts, that means they will lose if they’re unresponsive going forward. %$* 183
they can improve them further, with the passage of the open primary, which i assure you, the republican party will oppose, the democratic party will oppose, which oughta tell you how you should vote. %$* 183
and on all major issues like the constitutional convention, the vote in november will just be to go out and come back to us with recommendations. %$* 183
we don’t like the recommendations we will vote them down. %$* 183
but we know the legislature, republicans won’t allow taxes to increase, democrats won’t allow cuts in major programs—they are immobilized, they can’t solve the problem, the only people who can solve the problem are the voters, who will i predict with the open primary, have already with reapportionment, and will i believe, give voters the opportunity to come back to us with recommendations, hopefully to get away—get away with things like the two-thirds requirement to pass the budget. %$* 183
but if they don’t come back with good ideas, then the voters will knock it down, so— %$* 183
andreas— %$* 13
—direct democracy can be a problem, but it also can be a saving grace. %$* 183
andreas kluth. %$* 13
first of all i have to say i agree exactly with you, you’ve—because you lived there and because you came from outside as i did you saw that direct democracy is a large part of the problem. %$* 182
part of it is confusion over the word democracy, james madison didn’t want it even used in the constitution of the country, because he was afraid—they had studied ancient athens which was a failure because of direct democracy. %$* 182
they had studied republican rome, which was very stable, they wanted rome, not athens. %$* 182
fast forward to a century ago, the progressive era. %$* 182
californians and other western states introduced direct democracy because they were afraid of corruption by the southern pacific railroad of the young state california, they wanted direct democracies, voter directly passing legislation, as a safeguard, as a fourth branch of government to be used sparingly as in switzerland which was their model. %$* 182
fast forward again to prop 13, and onward, and you have a circus, earlier i said, an asylum that is run by the inmates. %$* 182
never mind the attack ads, the demagoguery %$* 182
here is the word count of the longest initiative, 15,633 words. %$* 182
that’s—it is, there was a, i remember driving in the car when several propositions were decided last year. %$* 182
an english teacher called in and said she’s not able to understand the initiatives in the ballot on grounds of syntax. %$* 182

and i'd also like to introduce the man who, 50 debates ago, founded intelligence squared u.s., mr. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
welcome. %$* 1
this evening is special because it marks our collaboration with the film society of lincoln center, coordinated with the opening of their splendid new facility and their premier of a documentary about the new york times, “page one,” which has a nice feature about intelligence squared, actually. %$* 1
it's also very special for intelligence squared, for our mission to promote a higher level of public discourse in america and for all of our supporters and staff, for john donvan, for our research head, kris kamikawa, for our executive producer, dana wolfe, and for me, because tonight we reach a landmark, which is our 50th debate. %$* 1
first amendment reads, quote, "congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of the press." but congress did pass a law back in 1917 called the espionage act which applies broadly to national defense information. %$* 1
the law prohibits disclosing such information to persons not authorized to receive it, who have reasons to know it could prejudice national security or u.s.interests. %$* 1
the founders recognized that a free press is an essential antidote to an abusive government. %$* 1
but congress recognized that a measure of secrecy is an essential attribute of an effective government. %$* 1
no reasonable person would dispute that matters like the movement of troops, the names of spies or the plans for building a nuclear bomb are necessary secrets which the press should not be publishing. %$* 1
but no sophisticated person would doubt that governments can be tempted to use the guise of national security to protect the reputation and electability of its officials. %$* 1
and between these two extremes, there are abundant shades of gray in which the national security bureaucracy might be genuine in its concerns but overbroad in its actions. %$* 1
i saw this myself when, early in my career, i was a national security analyst at the rand corporation. %$* 1
all of us had security clearances. %$* 1
but some of our work was classified at such a high level that their authors could not read them. %$* 1
the tensions here are obvious. %$* 1
the press will want to err on the side of disclosure, the government on the side of secrecy. %$* 1
well, how are the inevitable conflicts to be resolved? %$* 1
what principles should be applied and by whom? %$* 1
should the press publish what they like and take the risk of prosecution afterwards? %$* 1
or should government be able to prevent publication in the first instance? %$* 1
and who exactly is the press? %$* 1
a tricky question in an era of bloggers and wikileaks. %$* 1
these are complex and important issues. %$* 1
we have an extraordinary panel with us this evening to help you decide. %$* 1
and it's my pleasure to turn the evening over to them and to our moderator, john donvan. %$* 1
thank you. %$* 13
john, thank you. %$* 1
and may i just invite one more round of applause for robert rosenkranz for making this possible. %$* 13
so a major newspaper-- %$* 13
say a major newspaper of record gets a hold of some classified government material, say some leaked documents, some leaked government diplomatic cables and prints those documents. %$* 13
well, what has that newspaper done? %$* 13
has it exercised its rights under the first amendment, or has it betrayed the nation? %$* 13
and does the answer to that question depend on the consequences of publication? %$* 13
well, let's argue that out. %$* 13
that's what we are here for. %$* 13
this is another debate from intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
we are at the skirball center for the performing arts at new york university. %$* 13
and on this stage we have two teams of debaters, two tables, two members each. %$* 13
arguing for the motion, “freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets,” we have gabriel schoenfeld, who is author of “necessary secrets: national security, the media and the rule of law,” and his partner, michael chertoff, former secretary of homeland security and cofounder of the chertoff group. %$* 13
arguing against the motion that freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets, alan dershowitz, the felix frankfurter professor of law at harvard law school and david sanger, chief washington correspondent for the new york times. %$* 13
now, i just want to be clear because there's a negative in this motion. %$* 13
it can sometimes be tricky. %$* 13
“freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets.” if you support this motion, you’re leaning more towards the side for secrecy. %$* 13
if you are against, you're leaning more towards disclosure and more towards the liberty or license for the press. %$* 13
so i just want to be clear about that because of the next thing i want to say. %$* 13
this really is a debate. %$* 13
there will be winners and losers in this debate. %$* 13
it's a contest in which you, our live audience, act as the judges. %$* 13
by the time the debate has ended, you will have been asked to vote twice, once before and once after, to tell us what your view is on this motion, “freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets.”and the team that has changed the most minds in the course of the debate will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so let's go to your preliminary vote. %$* 13
if you go to those key pads at your seat, i'll state the motion again with the caveat that i put in, but i won't restate it because i think i confused everybody. %$* 13
“freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets,” if you agree with this motion, press number one. %$* 13
if you disagree, number two, and if you are undecided, press number three. %$* 13
and if you think you made a mistake, just correct it and the system will lock in your last vote. %$* 13
so we do this in three rounds. %$* 13
the first round is opening statements, seven minutes each by each debater. %$* 13
then we have a middle round in which they talk to each other and take questions from you. %$* 13
and then the third round are brief closing statements and then our final vote. %$* 13
so onto round one, opening statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
our motion is "freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets." and arguing for that motion, i'd like to introduce gabriel schoenfeld, senior fellow at the hudson institute and author of “necessary secrets: national security, the media and the rule of law.” and, gabriel, you are also a chess player, i understand chess master at the u.s. chess federation? %$* 13
that's right. %$* 304
so you've come to play and to win? %$* 13
yes. %$* 304
and i can see far ahead as well. %$* 304
ladies and gentlemen, gabriel schoenfeld. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, welcome. %$* 304
the gravity of the issue we're debating here tonight cannot be overstated. %$* 304
at stake is nothing less than preventing a reprise of the kinds of attacks that befell our city and our country nearly 10 years ago. %$* 304
to keep our country secure, our government inevitably generates a great many secrets of many different kinds. %$* 304
we cannot disclose all of the methods by which we track terrorists. %$* 304
we cannot publicize the vulnerabilities of our bridges and tunnels and buildings. %$* 304
we have an absolute duty to conceal things like the blueprints for nuclear weapons or the formulas for substances like aerosolized anthrax. %$* 304
but equally at stake is the character of our democracy. %$* 304
we live in an open society, and secrecy is antithetical to the democratic idea. %$* 304
secrecy can be used as a cover for corruption and wrong-doing. %$* 304
and we depend upon a free press to keep us informed about what our government is doing in our name, including the things that it's doing in secret, or at least some of them. %$* 304
and indeed the foreign affairs pages of our major newspapers are filled with stories based upon reporting drawn from state secrets. %$* 304
and that's the way things are, and that's the way they ought to be. %$* 304
but even as we have a press that we want to be delving into state secrets, it must do so under the rule of law. %$* 304
that is the press must be vulnerable to prosecution when it violates the laws governing secrecy. %$* 304
now here, as robert rosenkranz mentioned, we run head long into the first amendment. %$* 304
the first amendment says that congress shall make no law abridging freedom of speech or the press. %$* 304
but, of course, we live with numerous abridgments of free speech and free press, all widely accepted by the public and upheld by the courts. %$* 304
we can't libel one another. %$* 304
we can't engage in false advertising. %$* 304
and of course, it's forbidden to yell, "fire"-- %$* 304
falsely yell, "fire" in a crowded theater like this one. %$* 304
now, congress has enacted several statutes that criminalize the publication of state secrets. %$* 304
the espionage act was mentioned but one might also point to the atomic energy act that makes it a crime to publish classified material pertaining to the design of nuclear weapons. %$* 304
or the comint act which makes it a crime to publish classified information pertaining to cryptography, or code breaking, or the intelligence identities protection act makes it a crime to publish the identities of undercover cia officers and other intelligence officers of the u.s.government. %$* 304
now, these laws are all in obvious tension with the first amendment, but no court has ever struck them down. %$* 304
and it is a statement of fact, ladies and gentlemen, the proposition under debate here tonight, the freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets, is inarguably true. %$* 304
valid laws are on the books that criminalize the publication of certain state secrets. %$* 304
now, does the existence of such laws mean that every time a journalist like my colleague here, david sanger, publishes a state secret he should be prosecuted and marched off to prison? %$* 304
absolutely not. %$* 304
that would be foolish in the extreme. %$* 304
that's why we recognize that our government is promiscuous with the secrecy stamp. %$* 304
it marks lots of things secret that need not be. %$* 304
and back when i was an editor at commentary magazine, i myself published classified information and i would do so again. %$* 304
the real question raised by the proposition is whether the press can and should be prosecuted in those instances when it places the country in danger. %$* 304
such danger is not purely hypothetical. %$* 304
back in the 1970s there was a magazine called counterspy that began to publish the identities of hundreds of cia officers around the world. %$* 304
in 1975, it outed richard welch as the cia station chief in athens. %$* 304
and no sooner was his name disclosed that he was murdered by a greek terrorist organization as a direct result of that revelation. %$* 304
today we have wikileaks which in the name of transparency has indiscriminately dumped thousands of secret diplomatic and military cables onto the internet. %$* 304
now, some of those documents are innocuous. %$* 304
and many of them without question help us better understand what our government is doing around the world and what other governments are doing, but some of them are outright dangerous. %$* 304
one wikileaks document, a u.s.army document that they put on the internet, describes the technical details of the jamming devices used by our soldiers in iraq to scramble the signals that insurgents were using to detonate roadside bombs. %$* 304
now, i ask you is there any reasonable person who believes it should be legal to publish the secret countermeasures used by our soldiers to keep from getting blown up on the battlefield? %$* 304
is there any reasonable person who believes it should be legal to publish blueprints for making nuclear bombs-- %$* 304
or should it be legal to give out the recipe for-- %$* 304
to publish the recipe for making aerosolized anthrax? %$* 304
those are questions that i hope we will receive straightforward answers to tonight from david sanger and alan dershowitz. %$* 304
if they believe those things should be allowed, i hope they'll fully and frankly acknowledge the costs, and if they think those things should be prohibited by law, well, then they'll be agreeing with the very proposition that they supposedly came here to oppose. %$* 304
ladies and gentlemen, freedom of the press does not, cannot, and should not extend to state secrets. %$* 304
not all government secrets warrant protection, but some clearly do. %$* 304
and if you in the audience agree with what justice robert jackson once memorably said, that the constitution of the united states is not a suicide pact, i urge you to vote for the proposition at issue here tonight. %$* 304
thank you. %$* 304
thank you, gabriel schoenfeld. %$* 13
our motion is "freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets," and here to speak against this motion, alan dershowitz, harvard law professor and consultant to wikileaks founder julian assange's legal defense team. %$* 13
alan dershowitz is, as we all know, a great attorney and a celebrity attorney who's been played at least twice in the movies, you were played in "reversal of fortune" by the late great ron silver in the klaus von bulow story, and in "american tragedy, o.j. simpson trial," you were played by richard cox, but interesting, ron silver in that movie played robert shapiro, so was he upgrading the role or-- %$* 13
all i can tell you is "reversal of fortune," having been produced by son, elon dershowitz, who is in the audience, is a much better film. %$* 305
ladies and gentlemen, alan dershowitz. %$* 13
thank you so much. %$* 305
thank you. %$* 305
it's a distinct pleasure to be arguing with two such distinguished people-- %$* 305
gabriel schoenfeld, whose book i reviewed for the new york times, and reviewed very favorably. %$* 305
and i admire much of what he writes, but we disagree, and you'll hear the disagreements. %$* 305
and judge michael chertoff, whose work as a public figure deserves all of our appreciation. %$* 305
he has helped protect us for so many years. %$* 305
and of course, my distinguished colleague who will be arguing on my side. %$* 305
the proposition is far too broad. %$* 305
“state secrets” encompass far too much. %$* 305
and even the criteria used by my opponent-- %$* 305
quote “places the country in danger”-- %$* 305
is far, far too broad. %$* 305
let me start with a story that one of my dissident clients told me in the 1970s, when i was representing soviet dissidents in the bad old days of the soviet union. %$* 305
the joke went around during stalin's time that a dissident was arrested for the crime of calling stalin a “fool.”and he came to court and he said, “i didn't commit a libel. %$* 305
i want to defend myself. %$* 305
i will prove that what i said is truthful.” and he said, “you don't understand. %$* 305
you're not being charged with libel. %$* 305
you're being charged with revealing a state secret! %$* 305
” and that's precisely the kind of state secret that we often seek to protect. %$* 305
now, you don't have to be stalin. %$* 305
remember, everybody knows-- %$* 305
every newspaperman memorizes the famous quote of thomas jefferson that he made before he became a president. %$* 305
he said, “were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without government, i should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.” that was pre-presidential thomas jefferson. %$* 305
now let me read you a quote six years into his presidency: “a man who never looks into a newspaper is better informed than he who reads them. %$* 305
and as much as he who knows nothing is nearer the truth than he whose mind is filled with falsehoods and errors.”thomas jefferson sought to censor the press. %$* 305
we all know that he opposed the alien and sedition act. %$* 305
of course he did, because that was federal legislation. %$* 305
but he supported state legislation that would have censored the press and protected him from embarrassment. %$* 305
now, you just have to look in today's new york times to see how foolish some of these state secrets that are protected tend to be. %$* 305
finally, finally, the pentagon papers are about to be declassified and released. %$* 305
i defended senator mike gravel against the charges of reading the pentagon papers-- %$* 305
what was it-- %$* 305
40 years ago! %$* 305
and daniel ellsberg, in today's times, i think aptly states the reason why the pentagon papers were censored for so long. %$* 305
he said, “the reasons are very clearly domestic political reasons, not national security at all. %$* 305
the reasons for the prolonged secrets are to conceal the fact that so much of the policy making doesn't bear public examination. %$* 305
it's embarrassing or even incriminating.”you don't have to be as cynical as ellsberg-- %$* 305
and ellsberg is not one of my heroes. %$* 305
i agree with gabriel schoenberg's analysis of ellsberg for the man. %$* 305
but the point is a very, very important one. %$* 305
secrets get disclosed all the time. %$* 305
and the issue is not whether secrets will be disclosed. %$* 305
if you read the new york times, if you read bob woodward, if you read seymour hersh, you understand the question is who decides which secrets are disclosed to whom? %$* 305
when? %$* 305
secrets get disclosed. %$* 305
bob woodward has its sources. %$* 305
why do people talk to bob woodward? %$* 305
why do they give him classified information? %$* 305
why do they give seymour hersh classified information? %$* 305
because those are secrets that government officials want to have revealed. %$* 305
so the question is not “should state secrets be subject to the first amendment? %$* 305
”the question is, “should the government-- %$* 305
the executive branch of the government-- %$* 305
be making the decision as to which secrets to withhold and which to reveal? %$* 305
” secrets should be kept. %$* 305
and the primary responsibility for keeping secrets lies with those who have those secrets. %$* 305
if you look, for example, at how wikileaks got disclosed, the alleged culprit there is man-- %$* 305
a private named bradley manning-- %$* 305
who have never should have had access-- %$* 305
such easy access to the material that he disclosed. %$* 305
that was negligence on the part of the government. %$* 305
as julian assange, i think, aptly put it, “the best way to keep a secret is not to know it.” and if the government wants to keep secrets, they have to do a better job of preventing them from being leaked-- %$* 305
and not put the burden on the press. %$* 305
and by the way, i mean not only leaked wikileaks style, but leaked bob woodward, seymour hersh style, the kind of selective leaks that we've come to grow accustomed to. %$* 305
there are very limited numbers of secrets that deserve to be protected. %$* 305
and they can be listed and catalogued. %$* 305
you listed some of them. %$* 305
i agree with some. %$* 305
i disagree with others. %$* 305
the names of troops, of the nature of weapons. %$* 305
but you mentioned a couple, for example, methods used to track terrorists, vulnerability of bridges. %$* 305
those are very complicated. %$* 305
we have a right to know, at least in broad terms, what kinds of methods are being used, whether they're constitutional or not. %$* 305
we have a right to know if our bridges are vulnerable, not how they're vulnerable. %$* 305
these are very, very hard judgments. %$* 305
so you can agree with our side of the proposition while conceding that there are a limited number of things that should be kept secret. %$* 305
and i believe-- %$* 305
and here we have a real disagreement. %$* 305
you wrote in your book that you would prefer to leave this to the good judgment of prosecutors, the discretion of prosecutors and the common sense of jurors. %$* 305
what i would prefer to see is a complete starting from scratch with the espionage law of 1917. scrap it. %$* 305
it tells us nothing. %$* 305
and draft a very narrow statute that says you cannot disclose the nature of certain kinds of weapons. %$* 305
you cannot disclose the movement of troops. %$* 305
you cannot disclose the names of spies. %$* 305
that is not state secrets, broad general concept. %$* 305
that's a limited number of things that need protection, not protection from the new york times because the times won't publish them, but protection from internet people who will publish almost anything without any kind of accountability. %$* 305
there must be a strong presumption in favor of freedom of speech and sunshine as the best disinfectant. %$* 305
the government says, "trust us." no. %$* 305
don't trust the government. %$* 305
the new york times says, "trust us." don't trust the new york times. %$* 305
trust the process of checks and balances, whereby the government tries to keep secrets. %$* 305
the press tries to release the secrets. %$* 305
that process is the best guarantee of liberty. %$* 305
thank you. %$* 305
thank you, alan dershowitz. %$* 13
so here's where we are. %$* 13
we are halfway the open round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two fighting it out over this motion, “freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets.” you've heard two of the opening statements, and now onto a third. %$* 13
i'd like to introduce, arguing for the motion that freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets, michael chertoff is former secretary of homeland security and cofounder of the chertoff group. %$* 13
and after a long career in government, lived with the secrets, knows what some of them are. %$* 13
so just between us, because it's us here, you're going to share some of it? %$* 13
you're not going to hear any secrets from me, john. %$* 306
michael chertoff. %$* 13
thank you, very much. %$* 306
first, let me again thank you for inviting us to this debate. %$* 306
i think it's a critical issue for the country. %$* 306
i'm delighted to be on the same stage with such distinguished scholars and authors. %$* 306
i think, though, if i'm not mistaken, that the other side has essentially conceded the proposition for which we are arguing, and that proposition is that freedom of the press has to give way to state secrets. %$* 306
now, nobody is arguing that the proposition means everything that the government has in its possession is a state secret, nor are we arguing that simply having a single public official asserting that something is a state secret ends the analysis. %$* 306
but i think where the dispute has come down to is who actually makes the decision. %$* 306
is it the government and the government process, which is what our contention is and our proposition is, or is it the press. %$* 306
does the press get the final say? %$* 306
now, i will agree with professor dershowitz that in the first instance, the right way to deal with this problem is for the government to control its own secrets. %$* 306
and most of the time, the government succeeds in doing so. %$* 306
although the press is constantly making the argument that as a matter of law, they ought to have access to those secrets. %$* 306
and those arguments are relatively routinely rebuffed. %$* 306
but the reality is that there are times people do leak secrets. %$* 306
and sometimes they do it for what they may conceive to be noble motives. %$* 306
sometimes they do it for purposes of settling scores or personal advancement. %$* 306
and sometimes they do it perhaps because they want to hurt the united states. %$* 306
and in those instances, it is not enough to say that because the government has failed to keep the secret, the secret ought to become public and ought to be published widely. %$* 306
national security and human life cannot be the subject of a cat and mouse game. %$* 306
and so i would argue that actually the existing system, which does require freedom of the press to give way to genuine state secrets is pretty much the correct balance. %$* 306
how does that work? %$* 306
well, first of all, if the press wants to get a secret in the possession of the government, it's very difficult to do so. %$* 306
and there's a very strong presumption against simply open access to very significant classified material. %$* 306
but we do have cases where the material gets out. %$* 306
and there, i believe the law allows, if the facts are there and the intent is there, a prosecution to take place as a way of deterring somebody from publishing that secret. %$* 306
and that's in fact what the law basically is. %$* 306
there are statutes in the books that permit those prosecutions. %$* 306
when the courts have been confronted with those prosecutions, and those are relatively rare cases, the courts have upheld the principles of those prosecutions. %$* 306
even in the pentagon papers case, at least five of the justices and probably seven, indicated that there were instances where a prosecution might be appropriate even if not in that particular case. %$* 306
and even with respect to prior restraint, the issuance of an injunction to prevent publication, most of the justices on the court have acknowledged in the case of a very strong and dangerous release of information, for example, the proverbial publication of information about the movement of a troop ship, it would be appropriate to rejoin the publication of that material. %$* 306
and that's because the courts recognize that in the government process, a combination of executive action, congressional action and judicial action is the best mechanism for balancing between state secrets and freedom of the press. %$* 306
now, the press often argues we ought to be the judges. %$* 306
and the difficulty is that the press is sometimes a flawed judge of what is in the public interest. %$* 306
first of all, the press is not a monolith. %$* 306
as professor dershowitz pointed out, we're not concerned about the new york times. %$* 306
we're worried about people who blog. %$* 306
but the first amendment doesn't distinguish between the new york times and the wall street journal and al manar, which is the news organ of hezbollah. %$* 306
or extreme blogs on the right or the left. %$* 306
all of those are part of the press. %$* 306
nor do we want to have the government start to license particular organs as organs that can be trusted and organs that can't be trusted. %$* 306
the fact is if we say that state secrets have to give way to the press when the press gets hold of them, then we mean it has to be any member of the press, a blogger, a hezbollah journalist, somebody who works for a news organ run by the government of a foreign country. %$* 306
and i don't think any of us believe that would be prudent or safe. %$* 306
is the press right even when we deal with the venerable institutions that we're so familiar with? %$* 306
well, the press sometimes also makes mistakes. %$* 306
several years ago, there was a publication by the new york times. %$* 306
i know david sanger knows about this, of information about a program that allowed the united states government to see what was going on in the financial transactions that were being executed through a program known as swift. %$* 306
and this was critical in tracking the flow of money that was used to support terrorist activity. %$* 306
precisely one of the recommendations that was made by the 9/11 commission against the very strong request of the bush administration, that material was published. %$* 306
and the original argument was, well, this is something people need to know about because it's potentially illegal or requires some kind of oversight. %$* 306
but what emerged after a period of time is it was completely legal and that there was nothing wrong about it, and nobody's privacy had been improperly invaded. %$* 306
everything was done according to an appropriate process. %$* 306
and therefore, the public ombudsman of the new york times had to write a retraction. %$* 306
he had to write a piece in the times saying that while he had originally endorsed the publication of the swift material, he had changed his mind, and it was not appropriate because it turned out that there was nothing wrong with it, and there was no powerful interest served in releasing that material. %$* 306
and then he made an interesting and telling confession, that he had originally endorsed the disclosure because he didn't like the administration and the way the administration was treating the paper. %$* 306
and i suggest to you that that's the problem with having the press make the decision. %$* 306
the press is no more in a position to separate itself from its interests than anybody else. %$* 306
but unlike the organs of government which are accountable to the public and to each other, the press is accountable to nobody. %$* 306
and that's why i strongly urge you to support the proposition that we're advocating tonight. %$* 306
thank you very much. %$* 306
thank you, michael chertoff. %$* 13
our motion is "freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets." and now here to speak against the motion, david sanger, who is chief washington correspondent for the new york times and was part of the team involved in its wikileaks coverage, so you've, david, printed some secrets in your time. %$* 13
a few. %$* 307
a few. %$* 13
well, i hope you're going to share those with us since the other guy wouldn’t. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, david sanger. %$* 13
thank you thank you very much. %$* 307
and it's wonderful to be here and to be with such a great panel. %$* 307
in schoenfeld's book, if you haven't read it, it's a wonderful accounting-- %$* 307
historical accounting of the tension between the press and the government. %$* 307
michael chertoff has done a fabulous work and we have talked over many years on many different subjects, and i agree with almost everything that my partner here had to say except when alan dershowitz declared that you shouldn't necessarily trust everything that you read in the new york times. %$* 307
we’ll take that aside later on. %$* 307
i come to this as a practitioner, not as a legal expert. %$* 307
and i come to this knowing that the tensions that we are discussing here today are as you've heard as old as the republic. %$* 307
the new york times among other newspapers had reporters embedded with civil war troops, union troops, and at one appropriate moment or another, several generals having read the reviews of their strategy, took those reporters and put them in the brig. %$* 307
i've been around more than a few government officials who have suggested to me over the years as we have debated various stories that we were getting ready to write that what was good for general sheridan would be perfectly good today. %$* 307
i would argue that in fact it is impossible, it is impossible to separate out state secrets from what appears every day in the new york times and other major newspapers around the world. %$* 307
it is impossible because you cannot discuss the subject of whether or not we should have gone into iraq, or how quickly we should get out of afghanistan, or the issues surrounding cyber war that we deal with each and every day now, without daily venturing into territory that is classified somewhere and somehow. %$* 307
the problem is, as a reporter, i probably don't even know when much of that material is classified. %$* 307
and i can tell you as someone who went through the wikileaks material for many months before the times and other newspapers published them that i was pretty surprised by some things that were stamped “secret.” i came into the office one day and asked if anybody knew why every american embassy that collects the morning news accounts that would appear in the spanish press or the chinese press and collates them and sends them off to washington so that they would have a sense of what's appearing in those press reports each day. %$* 307
somebody on the way out the door, as they are putting that cable over to washington, stamps “secret” on them. %$* 307
they had appeared in the newspaper that morning. %$* 307
what does that tell you early on? %$* 307
it tells you that you cannot have a system in which you keep state secrets from being published if almost everything is a state secret. %$* 307
and my friend, michael chertoff, points out that the press is a flawed judge of the national interest. %$* 307
that is absolutely true, but a better judge than the u.s.government because when you read the u.s.government's own regulations for what gets made classified, what that stamp goes on, the rules only discuss national security considerations. %$* 307
there is no category that makes the person who's got that stamp in the hand weigh a public interest. %$* 307
only the press can do that and only after the information is out. %$* 307
now, there's a second issue around this which the other side pointed out, which is that only the executive, they said, really has the full knowledge to make those decisions. %$* 307
but in fact i think what you heard in the discussion of the constitutional origins of all of this is that the founders believed that to give the executive complete discretion in this area is to create a country that isn't like the america that we know. %$* 307
you would get egypt under mubarak; you would get the chinese press today. %$* 307
and americans feel that deeply. %$* 307
just think about the criticism directed at the new york times when we failed to go as deeply as we should have into the evidence concerning the justification for going into iraq. %$* 307
it would have been wonderful if we could have published more about what the u.s.government knew about whether weapons of mass destruction existed. %$* 307
eventually, we were able to. %$* 307
but at the time we were doing that reporting, it was all deeply classified, except for those tidbits that the u.s.government decided to release to support its own case. %$* 307
now, we are hardly indifferent, as reporters, to the question of what the consequences of these actions are. %$* 307
we live in new york and washington. %$* 307
our kids ride the subways. %$* 307
we have reporters who are out all across the world. %$* 307
many have been kidnapped. %$* 307
a couple, unfortunately, have been killed. %$* 307
a wonderful photographer for the new york times lost both his legs just a few months ago, stepping on an improvised land mine in afghanistan. %$* 307
we know that the violent jihadists, who we write about each and every day, have no interest in a free press. %$* 307
and we're not here to side with them. %$* 307
we are also not here to be propagandists for the u.s.government. %$* 307
and you don't want us to be. %$* 307
if you think, briefly, about some of the stories that we have held back on, we held back for a year on the story on warrantless wiretaps that president bush authorized. %$* 307
eventually, we published it. %$* 307
congress decided to rewrite the law. %$* 307
we held back for three years-- %$* 307
on a story i worked on for some time-- %$* 307
about a secret u.s.government program to help secure pakistan's nuclear weapons. %$* 307
we held the story because the government was fearful that if we published it too soon, we would be giving al-qaeda or the taliban directions into how to get to those weapons. %$* 307
and we published stories that are quite controversial including one earlier this year about stuxnet, the computer virus that many believe the u.s.government had a role in developing. %$* 307
it was used against the iranian nuclear program. %$* 307
what possibly could be the interest in that? %$* 307
very simple. %$* 307
if the u.s. government-- %$* 307
if any other government-- %$* 307
is starting off a cyber war, well, we are the country that is most vulnerable to that problem. %$* 307
and we could be subject to attacks in response. %$* 307
so, these are central policy issues. %$* 307
these secrets are not merely published because they are cool stories. %$* 307
they are published because there is a debate that the public has to conduct. %$* 307
thank you. %$* 307
thank you. %$* 13
david sanger. %$* 13
and that concludes round one of this intelligence squared u.s.debate where our motion is “freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets.” now, keep in mind how you voted at the top of the evening. %$* 13
you're going to be asked to vote once again at the end. %$* 13
i'm reminding you that the team that has changed the most minds will be declared our winner. %$* 13
a couple of other things i just wanted to mention, in terms of this being a radio broadcast, there are some-- %$* 13
the only somewhat scripted moments of the evening will be some introductions that i'll make repeatedly, telling you again and again who i am and who our panelists are, and where we all are, and we know that. %$* 13
and every now and then i'll say, “we'll be right back,” but we won't really go anywhere. %$* 13
we'll all still be here. %$* 13
and between the rounds that we just took, the stations like to take a break. %$* 13
so what i'd like to do is ask you, when i raise my hand, to burst into such enthusiastic applause that people listening in their cars will think, “these people must be having a great time. %$* 13
i'm going to stay and listen to this.” and then we'll move on to round two. %$* 13
so let's go do that. %$* 13
welcome back to this debate for the intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
we're at the skirball center for the performing arts at new york university. %$* 13
our motion is “freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets.” we have heard from both sides, the side arguing for the motion: gabriel schoenfeld and michael chertoff, who are arguing that a press that can publish state secrets without fear of prosecution actually endangers the nation. %$* 13
the team arguing against, david sanger and alan dershowitz, are arguing that yes, there are secrets that should be kept, but it should not be up to the executive of the u.s.government alone to decide which of those secrets are worthy of keeping secret. %$* 13
so we've heard opening arguments. %$* 13
and now, the two teams are going to be freer to debate each other and to address one another. %$* 13
and we'll take questions from you as well in just a few minutes. %$* 13
but i'd like to start putting to the team that is arguing for the motion-- %$* 13
and this is an argument for greater restriction on press freedom to publish secrets-- %$* 13
do you feel that the press can actually do its job, that your opponent, david sanger who is with the new york times, can do his job if he has to face fear of prosecution on a greater-- %$* 13
to a greater degree than he does now? %$* 13
michael chertoff. %$* 13
first of all, i respect david, and i certainly don't want to suggest he should ever put himself in harm’s way. %$* 306
but i think the answer to that is yes. %$* 306
most of the issues which david has talked about can be written about without getting into matters that are state secrets. %$* 306
first of all, there are times that information is declassified or becomes available from other sources and doesn't need to be entered into in great detail. %$* 306
but to give you an example of something that i would argue you shouldn't be able to do, is in the run-up to the bin laden raid that resulted in eliminating bin laden, obviously, it was a compelling public story. %$* 306
and the fact that we were going to be invading another sovereign country and taking military and fatal action against an individual who had not been tried or convicted was a big issue. %$* 306
i think it was a good idea, but others might have disagreed. %$* 306
and yet had that been leaked in advance, had it gotten into the hands of the press, i would argued it would be quite appropriate for the government to say to david sanger, “if you publish that, we will prosecute you, and perhaps we will even enjoin you from publishing it.” %$* 306
but your answer to my question is yes, he can do his job-- %$* 13
absolutely. %$* 306
i want to come back to david as a practical matter because you are the one who's practicing. %$* 13
can you respond to what you just heard? %$* 13
well, certainly the bin laden raid raises a very good question and is one in which the new york times has been very clear throughout the time that we went through the wikileaks material. %$* 307
long before that, we have said, as you can see from the examples i cited earlier, that we do not publish stories about operations. %$* 307
we don't name dissidents who walked into the chinese embassy and talked to american diplomats. %$* 307
where do we draw the line? %$* 307
information that is merely embarrassing as opposed to operational. %$* 307
so the u.s. government, during the midst of the wikileaks operation, asked us to withhold the information that the king of saudi arabia said in response to a discussion with an american diplomat about iran's nuclear program, "cut off the head of the snake." now, why did they consider this to be particularly sensitive? %$* 307
no one was going to go put the king of saudi arabia in jail the way a chinese or saudi dissident might be put in jail for saying the wrong thing. %$* 307
they considered it sensitive because it would make it more difficult to conduct american foreign policy if the king read his own words in the new york times or foreign publications. %$* 307
and so that's the distinction that i think is critical, the one between an operational secret and embarrassment. %$* 307
and there is no place in the law that makes that distinction. %$* 307
gabriel schoenfeld. %$* 13
well, i find that curious. %$* 304
operational secrets-- %$* 304
what is the swift program? %$* 304
but an operational program to monitor the finances of al-qaeda that the times published against the strong protest not only of the bush administration but leading democrats like lee hamilton of the 9/11 commission. %$* 304
and the times justification for it was always quite murky. %$* 304
eric lichtblau, the reporter, one of the two reporters who wrote the story, said in his memoir about it, "it was, above all else, an interesting yarn." what was the public interest that was served there? %$* 304
the times-- %$* 304
the ombudsman of the times, as secretary chertoff pointed out, disavowed the story. %$* 304
so did the general counsel of the times. %$* 304
so i don't think that in the final analysis we can just have a system where editors make the-- %$* 304
make such decisions without being subject, vulnerable to prosecution, not necessarily prosecuted, for instance, but vulnerable to prosecution. %$* 304
before we get into the weeds on the specifics of the cases, and we will do that, i do want to stay with the question of if you had to work under that threat of prosecution, what would it do to your ability to work? %$* 13
and maybe your colleague, alan dershowitz, would like to take this one. %$* 13
well, i can tell you that the greatest forms of censorship that take place today are not censorship imposed by the government. %$* 305
it's self-censorship resulting from fear of prosecution. %$* 305
i see that all the time, or fear of libel, other kinds of defamation lawsuits. %$* 305
so clearly it has an impact. %$* 305
but i'm not one who thinks that free speech is free or that it comes without costs. %$* 305
in fact, i think we've heard a very clever debaters' point here tonight from our opponents, namely that if we concede that there are any conceivable state secrets like the plan to kill osama bin laden, then we can see the proposition. %$* 305
that's absolutely not the case. %$* 305
the proposition is state secrets. %$* 305
and i submit that you've conceded our point by changing the debate from state secrets to-- %$* 305
and i quote judge chertoff-- %$* 305
to "genuine state secrets." and you also used a modifier, "real state secrets." the problem is it's just too broad. %$* 305
now, there are going to be problems. %$* 305
and the new york times is not the only game in town. %$* 305
judge, you mentioned, how about the hezbollah press? %$* 305
they might publish it. %$* 305
do you think american law is going to stop the hezbollah press from publishing anything? %$* 305
so that's just a red herring. %$* 305
okay, michael chertoff. %$* 13
but, see, i think this is the point. %$* 306
the point is-- %$* 306
and i don't think we have to argue that simply calling something a state secret ends the analysis. %$* 306
what's important is whether it's in the new york times or hezbollah press or somebody else. %$* 306
if they are in an area where they are dealing with material that is classified and sensitive, they have to make a judgment. %$* 306
now, there's a certain amount of uncertainty. %$* 306
and i understand that may have a chilling effect. %$* 306
but that chilling effect is what imposes a sense of responsibility. %$* 306
and let me say, everybody in the world who exercises power and authority, lives with the possibility that if they guess wrong, they're going to wind up in trouble, including, for example, cia agents who find themselves being investigated, and yet nobody says they should be immune from the possibility of investigation. %$* 306
i just think you're wrong empirically. %$* 305
i think you're wrong empirically. %$* 305
it's not the fact that people are guessing wrong. %$* 305
seymour hersh isn't guessing. %$* 305
he knows he's not being prosecuted because he's revealing a secret that you-- %$* 305
not you personally-- %$* 305
but somebody in the administration gave him on the sly. %$* 305
they say that, "we know it's classified, but please print this because it makes us look good. %$* 305
and if you print it, you won't be prosecuted." the end result is that people only feel chilled when they release secrets that make the administration look bad. %$* 305
when they reveal secrets that make the administration look good, they are not going to be prosecuted. %$* 305
i'll give you an example. %$* 305
i'm a supporter of the obama administration. %$* 305
i think they handled the post-osama bin laden killing miserably. %$* 305
what did they do? %$* 305
they revealed the fact that they got computers. %$* 305
that was a victory lap. %$* 305
nobody should have ever known that they got computers. %$* 305
they revealed the fact that they got telephone numbers of two guys in osama bin laden's phone book. %$* 305
nobody should have revealed that. %$* 305
why did the obama administration reveal that? %$* 305
they were proud of it. %$* 305
but they didn’t reveal the pictures. %$* 305
why didn’t they reveal the pictures? %$* 305
but i haven't heard-- %$* 13
let me just say for the record, alan, i have not heard from your side a refutation of their claim that david can't do his job without threat of prosecution. %$* 13
and so i mean, that point stays hanging out there and i think leans to their favor. %$* 13
david? %$* 13
david? %$* 13
let me just make one quick point. %$* 305
no. %$* 13
let david come in. %$* 13
please. %$* 13
can i do the job? %$* 307
yes. %$* 307
can i do the job the way all of you want me to do the job? %$* 307
probably not. %$* 307
and that's because, as you said, there is uncertainty in the system. %$* 307
there's always going to be uncertainty in this system. %$* 307
but the uncertainty can't extend to the point where we are stopping from publishing something that may be published, as alan points out, outside the country. %$* 307
it may be available in another form, maybe at a u.n.agency, maybe among international nuclear inspectors, and also was classified in the united states. %$* 307
and we simply will not know. %$* 307
we cannot know what is classified. %$* 307
you have to assume that almost anything on a sensitive subject like this is classified in some way. %$* 307
and so we have to roll that dice every single day. %$* 307
and we're willing to take that risk not for us, but because there is a broader readership and citizenship out there-- %$* 307
but michael said if you roll the dice, and you're wrong, there are no consequences for you. %$* 13
that's not true. %$* 307
okay. %$* 13
now-- %$* 13
why not? %$* 13
that's not true. %$* 307
why not? %$* 13
i mean, there-- %$* 307
you laid out very clearly what the laws are and what the penalties are. %$* 307
now, as you may also point out and schoenfeld does in his book, there has not been a successful prosecution under the espionage act against reporters. %$* 307
there have been against their sources. %$* 307
and part of this is because i think the government recognizes that once you start down that road, it's very unclear where you draw the line. %$* 307
okay, michael chertoff. %$* 13

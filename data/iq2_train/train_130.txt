ieds are the biggest, most effective killers of american troops in afghanistan. %$* 379
that is why he is possibly going to be targeted. %$* 379
it's not a surprise to him-- %$* 379
okay. %$* 13
let me take-- %$* 13
that that's going to happen. %$* 379
same question to the other side. %$* 13
hina, would you like to take that? %$* 13
sure. %$* 381
hina shamsi. %$* 13
you know, american citizens always have the right to due process. %$* 381
the question is, what does due process look like in a particular circumstance? %$* 381
and when we're talking about an actual armed conflict, people on a battlefield, then due process does not require trial or charges if lethal force is going to be used. %$* 381
when we're talking about an american citizen who is posing an imminent threat, walking down the street waving a gun or some other kind of imminent threat situation-- %$* 381
then, no, due process does not require charge and trial, conviction before anything-- %$* 381
before a death penalty. %$* 381
so, you're saying his right to due process is context-sensitive-- %$* 13
context-related? %$* 13
well, and-- %$* 381
but-- %$* 381
to how it's actually-- %$* 13
to these limited circumstances, right? %$* 381
but what we're talking about here is something that goes far beyond that, which is the claim that a person may be deprived of their due process rights, even when they are far from any battlefield, even when they do not pose an imminent threat, and that the government will not let-- %$* 381
or does not want to let the judiciary test that claim. %$* 381
that is, at heart, one of the most problematic things that is going on. %$* 381
michael lewis. %$* 13
in other words, he gets to build all the bombs he wants until we get the judiciary to say otherwise. %$* 379
that-- %$* 381
well, let hina follow and then i'll actually come back to you. %$* 13
do you want to ask your question %$* 381
i guess my question is, who-- %$* 19
all right. %$* 13
we need the mike or you won't be-- %$* 13
oh, sorry. %$* 19
on the radio. %$* 13
who decides that i'm an imminent threat-- %$* 19
the executive. %$* 18
okay? %$* 19
it's-- %$* 19
i know-- %$* 19
are you saying that the government has records of these people and they have documentation that i've been building bombs and that i'm a member of this terrorist organization? %$* 19
well, not only that. %$* 305
they have-- %$* 305
they have-- %$* 305
alan dershowitz. %$* 13
drones which actually see them doing it. %$* 305
it has to go through about six levels before a targeted assassination is authorized. %$* 305
it has to first go through the intelligence community. %$* 305
they have to have a report. %$* 305
the reason there have been leaks is the president of the united states has apparently refused to accept the recommendation of the killing of this person now who is on the possible hit list. %$* 305
he wants more evidence. %$* 305
he wants more review. %$* 305
he wants more process. %$* 305
essentially, this administration-- %$* 305
i'm not here defending the administration-- %$* 305
has insisted on essentially an administrative warrant, essentially a multi-layered process. %$* 305
and they have been very, very cautious about when they've done it, how they've done it, and to whom they've done it. %$* 305
that's why there have only been four. %$* 305
when you compare that to how incautious we allow our police often to be in making on the spot decisions about whether to use lethal force against fleeing felons or against hostage-takers, you will see that we're much more cautious about our enemies who are trying to kill us than about american citizens in the united states-- %$* 305
we should not apply a higher standard-- %$* 305
a more difficult standard to people who have as their-- %$* 305
all right. %$* 13
declared goal-- %$* 305
can you %$* 13
to kill as many americans as possible. %$* 305
so i can get in one more question? %$* 13
sure. %$* 381
hina shamsi. %$* 13
i really want to get at what the heart of this issue is, which is what the administration's policy and what is the legal interpretation standards that they are applying. %$* 381
evidence-- %$* 381
they're keeping it entirely secret. %$* 381
apart from naming four u.s.citizens who have been killed, they have not identified any other information on the record to a court where it can be subjected to independent review. %$* 381
that is the heart of due process. %$* 381
the administration's claim is that due process does not equal judicial process. %$* 381
and we could not disagree more. %$* 381
the one other things that i would add is that when you look at the white paper, which is all we currently know are the standards that the administration is using, it uses the same cases that we have used to the courts, to argue for judicial process. %$* 381
it uses the same language of due process. %$* 381
it recognizes what is due, but then it radically reinterprets what the courts have said to fit a situation in which the legal constraints, important constraints that the law places to ensure that the people, the government-- %$* 381
okay. %$* 13
kills really are their-- %$* 381
i have to interrupt you for this reason. %$* 13
i would like to get in one more question. %$* 13
can everybody commit, including the questioner, to you pop out a question, 30 seconds, 30 seconds. %$* 13
can we do that? %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
pop that question, sir. %$* 13
and just wait for the mike. %$* 13
okay. %$* 386
larry nessbaum of philadelphia. %$* 386
listen, real quickly, it's a thin blue line to me. %$* 386
i want to understand, let's look back to the taliban, when we supported them-- %$* 386
what i-- %$* 13
can you just make a question, if you will. %$* 13
what would you do if now we switch allegiances? %$* 386
we're for the taliban, now we're against the taliban. %$* 386
what happens to those americans who are stuck in the middle when we change allegiances, and we're supporting one country, and americans are there, and they get killed, and we've switched allegiances? %$* 386
and they're not targeted, but they die. %$* 386
okay. %$* 13
i'm-- %$* 13
i'm going to pass on your question because i think it's a little bit more of a policy question and a little bit more of a statement. %$* 13
and it's interesting and relevant. %$* 13
but, ma'am, down front here. %$* 13
and just wait for that mike to come around. %$* 13
mary greg, philadelphia. %$* 387
i'd like a definition of where the battlefield is. %$* 387
thank you. %$* 387
i'm going to pass because they've-- %$* 13
they've defined it a couple of times. %$* 13
they have. %$* 387
but where do you see the battlefield now? %$* 387
where is it? %$* 387
all right. %$* 13
fair enough. %$* 13
this side. %$* 13
sure. %$* 381
right now-- %$* 381
hina shamsi. %$* 13
the battlefield exists in afghanistan and potentially the border regions with pakistan. %$* 381
so they can get asylum in yemen. %$* 305
if they just go to yemen. %$* 305
aren't you encouraging every al-qaeda terrorist to leave those two countries and go to places where you say the president can't get them? %$* 305
noah feldman. %$* 13
the president can get them, provided their threat is imminent. %$* 380
it's as simple as that. %$* 380
and we've circled back, and that concludes-- %$* 13
concludes round two of this intelligence squared u.s.debate, where our motion is, the president has constitutional power to target and kill u.s.citizens abroad. %$* 13
and now we're going to move on to round three. %$* 13
and round three are brief closing statements from each debater in turn that last two minutes. %$* 13
you do these seated. %$* 13
and i just want to remind you that you voted before the debate began, and you're going to vote immediately after these closing statements. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers have moved the most in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. %$* 13
onto round three, closing statements from each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be two minutes each. %$* 13
the motion being, the president has constitutional power to target and kill u.s.citizens abroad. %$* 13
here to argue in his closing statement, in support of this motion, michael lewis, a professor of law at ohio northern university, pettit college of law. %$* 13
having flown after hostile territory, i have some appreciation for the restrictions and constraints that our opponents are trying to place on our commander in chief and the armed forces he commands. %$* 379
you have to remember that every soldier is an extension of the president's war-making power. %$* 379
for me to use my weapons, certain parameters had to be met. %$* 379
and those parameters were established for me by my chain of command which ended with the president of the united states. %$* 379
on missions in which those parameters might be exceeded, provisions were made for me to contact people higher in my chain of command who could give me weapons release authority in situations outside of the narrow discretion i was given in my brief. %$* 379
but according to our opponents, even if i had the president of the united states himself on the line, if my target was an american citizen, or if there was an american citizen amongst the enemies that i was targeting, then he could not give me the authority to release the weapons. %$* 379
we would have to go to the judiciary to ensure that the due process rights of our enemies were not infringed. %$* 379
and while there may be certain circumstances-- %$* 379
they were talking about, well, how imminent is it if we're talking about al-awlaki? %$* 379
there may be certain circumstances in which there is time for discussion between the judiciary and the executive branch. %$* 379
but i guarantee you that there are many, many times in which there is not sufficient time for such discussions and deliberations. %$* 379
justice jackson famously said that the constitution is not a suicide pact. %$* 379
but for members of our armed forces, that is precisely what our opponents are trying to make it. %$* 379
thank you. %$* 379
thank you, michael lewis. %$* 13
the motion, the president has constitutional power to target and kill u.s. citizens abroad; here to summarize her position against this motion, hina shamsi, director of the aclu national security project. %$* 13
when i started out earlier this evening, i laid out the ways in which both constitution and international law work together in order for there to be authority to protect us as well as to protect individual liberties. %$* 381
we talked about the extent to which there is a right to use lethal force and how important it is that that right be constrained. %$* 381
and i remind you that our founders included the due process clause in the bill of rights at a time when the very life of the republic was at stake, when it was facing an existential threat. %$* 381
that's not the issue now. %$* 381
but even then, at that time, founders believed that there's some powers that a people should never concede to their government. %$* 381
that's why they included the due process clause, because they thought that extraordinary powers in one office inevitably will be abused no matter who sits behind that desk. %$* 381
that's especially true when we are faced with amorphous terms like "global battlefield," "associated forces," terms that can be subjected to misuse, abuse, regardless of how good the intent of the human being can be. %$* 381
the basic proposition before you today is that the president can carry out a targeted killing of a person, including american citizens, without due process, without ever presenting that evidence to a court. %$* 381
the executive has that power even with respect to a 16-year-old who is killed far from any battlefield. %$* 381
that is quite simply not the law. %$* 381
the president has gone beyond what the constitution and international law permits him to do. %$* 381
we ask you to vote against the proposition in order to start reining back the kinds of powers that have been so dangerously assumed and asserted today. %$* 381
thank you, hina shamsi. %$* 13
our motion, the president has constitutional power to target and kill u.s. citizens abroad, here summarizing his position in favor of this motion, alan dershowitz, the felix frankfurter professor of law at harvard law school. %$* 13
i think that our opponents have essentially conceded the motion. %$* 305
the president does have constitutional power to target and kill u.s.citizens abroad they concede, if it's on the battlefield, if it's imminent, and they don't distinguish between americans and non- americans. %$* 305
that, it seems to me, essentially concedes the proposition and imposes some limitations on it. %$* 305
they throw out some red herrings like a 16-year-old. %$* 305
nobody ever targeted a 16-year-old. %$* 305
that 16-year-old was tragically and accidentally killed the way 16-year-olds are tragically and accidentally killed on battlefields, and in all aspects of war and the way they're killed by terrorists. %$* 305
look, i love the constitution. %$* 305
i have devoted my life to defending civil liberties and the constitution. %$* 305
i, too, was on the national board of the aclu. i'm here today to defend civil liberties. %$* 305
the civil liberties of noncombatants, all noncombatants, whether americans or non- americans, i believe in a living constitution which adapts to changing times. %$* 305
i fear that if the president's ability to defend us against terrorist attacks, even those committed by american citizens is placed within an unrealistic straight jacket, grave damage will be done to our constitution and to the international laws of war that distinguish between civilians and combatants, not between americans and others. %$* 305
the constitution is a living document that permits every generation of americans to strike the appropriate balance between protecting our civilians and living within the rule of law. %$* 305
we can do both. %$* 305
we can do both as long as we adapt to new realities such as the fact that terrorist groups operate all over the world and operate within civilian areas. %$* 305
we must adapt. %$* 305
allowing the president to employ these drone strikes will strike that proper balance. %$* 305
so in the name of the constitution, in the name of civil liberties and human rights and common sense, i urge you to vote yes. %$* 305
thank you, alan dershowitz. %$* 13
the motion, the president has constitutional power to target and kill u.s. citizens abroad, here to summarize his position against this motion, noah feldman, the bemis professor of international law at harvard law school. %$* 13
i really love debating. %$* 380
and this has been a really fun debate. %$* 380
and arguments have been terrific on all sides. %$* 380
but the stakes of your vote and the stakes of this debate are a little different than they would be for almost any other kind of debate that intelligence squared could put together. %$* 380
and i want so just say why that is. %$* 380
in the real world, the way that drone strikes are now used, is that an administration-- %$* 380
it could be democratic or republican-- %$* 380
leaks to the press that it plans to target and kill a particular american somewhere in the world. %$* 380
last time it was yemen, this time in process it's pakistan. %$* 380
now, that leaves that person a choice. %$* 380
and in the case of the yemen example, that person through his father actually came to a u.s.court and said, "hey, i'd like to be heard. %$* 380
you got the wrong guy. %$* 380
i'm a propagandist. %$* 380
i don't like america very much. %$* 380
but i'm exercising my free speech rights." and the executive branch said to the courts, "don't hear this case." they used a bunch of reasons, but one of them was, "it's a secret whether we're targeting him or not." this was after they had leaked it. %$* 380
then they killed him. %$* 380
and then they said, "well, you definitely don't get review after the fact," right? %$* 380
"oh, and, by the way, we did kill him," so it wasn't apparently that much of a secret after he was dead or when it was leaked in the first place. %$* 380
now, we're in the midst of one of these processes right now. %$* 380
now, we could speculate about why the government does it this way nowadays. %$* 380
one possibility is that they've got a bad conscience about whether this is really imminent under their own legal definition. %$* 380
but i'll tell you this, and i'm really not joking, when they're running something up the flagpole to see who salutes, they're trying to see how you, not "you" in the abstract, "you, the particular people in this room" will vote on this question. %$* 380
how you vote will be noticed. %$* 380
it will be a component of a real world process at the end of which someone will live or die. %$* 380
and on that basis i urge you to vote, "no." %$* 380
thank you, noah feldman. %$* 13
and that concludes closing statements. %$* 13
and now it's time to learn which side you have been persuaded by or not. %$* 13
we're going to ask you again to go to the keypad at your seat and look again at this motion and its language and the two teams that have argued for and against it, "the president has constitutional power to target and kill u.s.citizens abroad." if you now support this motion, push number one. %$* 13
if you are against this motion, push number two. %$* 13
and if you became or remain undecided, push number three. %$* 13
i'll let another 10 seconds go by to lock that out, and it will take us about a minute and a half to get the results back to you. %$* 13
and while that is happening, a few things i would like to say, one is what a pleasure it has been to be hosted here today by the ncc, and, you know, the comments that noah feldman said about seeing independence hall and the references to the history, i mean, it really felt tonight as we were having this constitutional debate that we could feel the vibrations of history coming through the floor. %$* 13
it was spectacular to be here, and it was an honor to be the guest of jeffrey rosen and the national constitution center. %$* 13
thanks so much for having us. %$* 13
this program was also supported in part by the daniel berger esquire, programming fund for the national constitution center. %$* 13
our thanks as well to the fund. %$* 13
we would love to have you tweet about this debate. %$* 13
you can use the twitter handle, @iq2us, and the hashtag potusdebate. %$* 13
our next debate is going to be at the kauffman center in new york next week. %$* 13
the motion is-- %$* 13
and i'll tell you, we planned this one six months ago-- %$* 13
the motion is, "russia is a marginal power." so if you can make it up to new york, please do that. %$* 13
the other thing i want to say is that the mission of intelligence squared is to-- %$* 13
the name is in the title partially, and it's to raise the level of public discourse. %$* 13
and that happened in two ways. %$* 13
the first way is the spirit of intellectual engagement, honesty, and respect for one another that all of these debaters brought to the stage. %$* 13
i would really like to thank them for the way that you all handled this debate. %$* 13
and the second thing i want to say is that very often the audience q&a thing can be very tough in new york and getting it all to work out. %$* 13
this audience was spectacular, and i heard you. %$* 13
and even the questions that i passed on, i think they were excellent. %$* 13
they were just a little bit off point, but i want to thank everybody who got up and asked a question. %$* 13
and thank you, all, for the way that you participated in this debate tonight. %$* 13
so, all right, it's all in now. %$* 13
i have been given the results. %$* 13
remember, the team that has changed the most votes in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. %$* 13
the motion is this, "the president has constitutional power to target and kill u.s.citizens abroad." when we have announced the winner, you may feel free to congratulate them with your applause. %$* 13
the first vote, 29 percent were for the motion, 44 percent were against, and 27 percent were undecided. %$* 13
so those are the first results. %$* 13
remember, you voted a second time. %$* 13
the winner is the team that has changed its numbers the most from the first vote to the second. %$* 13
so here is the second vote. %$* 13
the team arguing for the motion, their second vote was 54 percent. %$* 13
that's 29 to 54 percent, 25 percentage points, which is the number to beat. %$* 13
the team against the motion, their first vote, 44 percent, their second vote, 39 percent. %$* 13
they went down five percent. %$* 13
that means the team arguing for this motion has prevailed, with the motion being "the president has constitutional power to target and kill u.s. citizens abroad." our congratulations to them, and thank you from me, john donvan, and intelligence squared u.s. we'll see you next time. %$* 13

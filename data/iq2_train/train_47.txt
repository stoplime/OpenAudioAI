they do. %$* 236
i could teach it right now-- %$* 236
because i think it's important to point out, from my point of view, what drove the founding fathers at that field into mysticism was the fact that getting at the very depths of trying to understand subatomic reality they were led to believe the consciousness, the observing mind actually played a role in the unfolding of what was being observed. %$* 234
and i think that that mystery, to my satisfaction, has not really been solved in a way that says that the concerns of people like de broglie and dirac, einstein, bohr, and others, that they were trying to understand how consciousness influenced them. %$* 234
so is your point, for those of us who are just not as well steeped in the conversation that's already happening here-- %$* 13
is your point that there is a kind of reality that you are saying is beyond science, the-- %$* 13
total of science that we know now? %$* 13
let me ask raymond. %$* 13
raymond, can you move in just-- %$* 13
you need to be really right on top of that mic. %$* 13
great. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
well, i believe at some point science can be very useful at determining a lot of this. %$* 234
but i'm going to-- %$* 13
and i'm going to move on because i don't want to belabor this topic, but-- %$* 13
but what sean-- %$* 13
what sean was saying to you was that you're basically saying there just cannot be any other explanation other than the one that i have, and therefore science really isn't relevant at this point. %$* 13
i think that-- %$* 234
in my view, this is all about how understanding the true nature of consciousness, soul and spirit, has a lot to do with helping to take physics to the next level in terms of understanding-- %$* 234
okay. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
sean carroll. %$* 13
the thing about einstein, bor, de broglie, et cetera, the founders of quantum mechanics, is that they're all dead, and they have been dead for many decades. %$* 236
and we know what's going on much better now than we did back then. %$* 236
they were inventing quantum mechanics, and occasionally they toyed with the idea that somehow consciousness had something to do with the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics. %$* 236
now we know better. %$* 236
we know how laws of quantum mechanics help explain how electrons move in the brain, and there's nothing in there-- %$* 236
take 15 seconds and tell us why quantum mechanics has been brought up by your opponent, why that has relevance here. %$* 13
well, it's-- %$* 236
i can only quote mit physicist scott aaronson who says, as far as he can tell, quantum mechanics is confusing, and consciousness is confusing, so maybe they're the same. %$* 236
raymond moody, let's bring you into the conversation. %$* 13
you know, really, i think the end reality, what we're dealing with here is not a scientifically decidable issue, but a philosophical question. %$* 235
and what it's called is the mind-body problem, probably first articulated in the west by pythagoras, but there have been many, many different theories of it. %$* 235
the one that's current in the neurosciences is called epiphenomenalism, which says, in effect, that there is no independent reality to what we experience as consciousness. %$* 235
but it's a secondary byproduct of the primary reality which is the brain and the electrochemical events going on in the brain. %$* 235
in my opinion, that's a philosophical statement, really. %$* 235
and my answer is, i don't know. %$* 235
i think the mind-body problem is still unresolved. %$* 235
all right. %$* 13
let's go to your opponent, steven novella, who specializes in whether the mind is in the brain or not. %$* 13
i think, you know, dr. %$* 237
alexander said that the experience that he remembers-- %$* 237
again, i don't doubt he has a memory of a profound experience-- %$* 237
that it could not have occurred as he was coming out of his coma. %$* 237
but you have no basis for that statement, i don't think, that you have no sense of time. %$* 237
your brain also constructs your sense of time. %$* 237
and when your brain is only partially working, you can have experiences that are hyper-real, that are both bizarre, that it's hard for you to reconstruct. %$* 237
and then your memory struggles to sort of construct a narrative that makes sense. %$* 237
it takes these bits and pieces of things that were firing in your head when you were in this semi-conscious state, and it constructs a narrative out of it based usually culturally on your pre-existing beliefs. %$* 237
you know, near-death experiences, whether,-- %$* 237
okay. %$* 13
as moody said in a cave, in a cave %$* 237
you're providing a lot of other ways that what eben says could have happened-- %$* 13
could not have happened any-- %$* 13
okay, so. %$* 13
perfectly consistent with what we know about the brain. %$* 237
i want to take that back to eben then. %$* 13
so your opponent, steven novella has just laid out many, many scenarios in which you experienced could not-- %$* 13
could have been real to you, but not-- %$* 13
not real. %$* 13
well, i would say the-- %$* 234
and what are your responses to his specifics? %$* 13
well, the interesting thing to me in looking back on it is the fact that, you know, i started for a very long time in what i call this "earthworm eye-view," a very primitive, coarse, unresponsive realm that had absolutely no kind of interactivity to it, and yet i remember that prolonged period. %$* 234
and that's what i said earlier is that the next step beyond that should have been one of no awareness at all, and yet what really happened was the blinders coming off and emerging into this far grander reality that was-- %$* 234
but, i mean, you-- %$* 13
which was much crisper than my %$* 234
but your response-- %$* 13
your responses to your opponents' criticisms keep returning to, "what i saw, this is what i saw, this is what i experienced," and that's not a response to the point he made, that there are other ways in which you could have seen what you saw. %$* 13
so that's what i want you to do, is to respond to steven novella's, you know, two or three scenarios for ways in which what you experienced may have been generated by your ill brain. %$* 13
well, to have that be an explanation, one would want at least some part of the neocortex still in a state that could participate because all of our modern thinking in neuroscience-- %$* 234
during your recovery-- %$* 18
let him finish. %$* 13
go ahead. %$* 13
is that there really was no part of my brain-- %$* 234
i mean, the factors that showed me when it happened, which was between days one and five and not at the end on coming out of it, basically those are part of the experience itself that to me were very difficult to explain, because they showed that it happened when my doctors told me my brain was way too sick to manufacture anything. %$* 234
okay, so that's a very solid answer. %$* 13
he's saying his brain was flat. %$* 13
nothing, nothing was going on, therefore, the kinds of experiences you are saying his brain could have generated, they could not have generated. %$* 13
it was shut. %$* 13
well, we don't know and he didn't give an answer to the question of when did those memories form? %$* 237
we don't know. %$* 237
they were not necessarily happening when you were at your worst. %$* 237
and when you were at your worst, there wasn't the kind of functional monitoring that we would've needed to know that your brain was not functioning at all. %$* 237
we don't know that. %$* 237
we saw anatomically, we had edema, swelling, and that certainly would have kept you unconscious, but you weren't getting an fmri, a pet scan, or an eeg as far as i could see anything that you've written or said about it that would have documented zero brain activity. %$* 237
you can't say that. %$* 237
nobody can say that. %$* 237
and even still, the memories that you have now were not necessarily formed when you were at your deepest part of the coma. %$* 237
they could've been forming in the hours and days when you were coming out of the coma. %$* 237
then you had a later delusional period, but at different points in time, different parts of your brain were working or not working, and you were constructing reality in a very bizarre way, in ways that we can reproduce with drugs and hypotension and, you know, with electromagnetic stimulation of different parts of your brain. %$* 237
is that valid, that the entire near-death experience, as described by thousands of people, can be recreated by drugs and putting electricity across the brain? %$* 13
no, i would say that's not true at all. %$* 234
there are tremendous examples of people encountering souls of departed loved ones, learning information that they couldn't possibly learn in any other way. %$* 234
you had said earlier that there were no cases of any of these memories being generated when the brain was out, and yet there are examples of that, where the brain-- %$* 234
people under deep anesthesia, with complete circulatory arrest, things like that, where they do have some astonishing stories of getting information that it doesn't seem to be any other way that they could have gotten it. %$* 234
so those cases are out there. %$* 234
but those cases are not controlled or documented, so, in other words we don't know that they couldn't have gotten that information any other way a lot of those cases i've read, that they're like cold readings, you're getting information that is either plausible or later was retrofitted to the scenario. %$* 237
it's all a lot of special pleading, the same kind of information you get from a psychic. %$* 237
it's not controlled scientific information. %$* 237
there are, in fact, attempts at putting controls in place like putting playing cards on top of a shelf that could only be viewed if you were actually floating above the ceiling. %$* 237
and to the extent that those have been done, no one has been able to demonstrate any information that could only have been obtained while they were extracorporeal, floating above their body. %$* 237
and, by the way, we could make you float above your body. %$* 237
okay. %$* 13
raymond moody, did you want to comment or-- %$* 13
i can go back to eben. %$* 13
yeah, you can go to eben. %$* 235
because i actually want to move on to a different point that was made, and that was, sean carroll, you were making the point that we're wired to want this to be true, we're wired to want to-- %$* 13
to shape strange events into narratives and into narratives that we particularly like, and my response to that is maybe that's true, but that doesn't necessarily mean that's what happened over here. %$* 13
and there's a little bit of an argument, ad hominem thing about it, is you're not a reliable reporter because you just want that to be true. %$* 13
and it's a little bit insulting almost to say, "you can't be trusted because you want everything to be happy." respond to that. %$* 13
yeah, i hope it's not insulting. %$* 236
it's certainly not ad hominem because the message is that nobody can be trusted. %$* 236
i think that that is part of what science has taught us, that if someone makes an extraordinary claim, the very first questions we should be asking ourselves are, number one, is there a different, simpler alternative explanation? %$* 236
and number two, how would we know if our purported explanation were false? %$* 236
how would we disprove it? %$* 236
how could we possibly test this idea? %$* 236
and i think that, you know, when you look at the bigger picture of how the universe works, how the laws of physics work, the enormous success of understanding matter, energy, the brain, life-- %$* 236
everything that we've had-- %$* 236
there's just an enormous presumption against the idea that somehow, through ways that there are no equations, no experiments, or no direct evidence to tell us, the information in our brains persists after we die and is there forever and talking to other people who died. %$* 236
so, it's just a matter of presumption. %$* 236
there's plenty of things that i would like to be true-- %$* 236
and i have been tricked into believing they're true. %$* 236
so, i know that i should be especially skeptical about them. %$* 236
all right. %$* 13
raymond moody, you're the philosopher on the panel. %$* 13
and you've said that this essentially a philosophical question. %$* 13
so, take on what sean carroll has just said, from the philosophical point of view. %$* 13
what i would say about what sean says is i agree with it up to a point, in the sense that, yes, i love physics, too. %$* 235
i was an astronomer from the age of seven and so on. %$* 235
and i accept there's a physical realm and so on. %$* 235
but that doesn't rule out that there could be a state of being that doesn't operate by physical principles. %$* 235
i noticed, sean, when you were trying to think of some other realm, you were thinking in terms of energy or soul substance or whatever. %$* 235
but i'm talking about something entirely different. %$* 235
there's no inconceivability in thinking that everything that we know is true. %$* 235
and yet, there is a higher dimension or a higher domain of existence that sort of-- %$* 235
in which this one is included. %$* 235
but this-- %$* 236
sean carroll. %$* 13
i mean, that's-- %$* 236
i think that's a perfect thing to have said in this debate, because it illustrates the difference here. %$* 236
no evidence was given for this claim. %$* 236
no reason to believe it was given. %$* 236
all we are given is, "well, maybe it's true and you can't absolutely disprove it." maybe it is conceivable. %$* 236
we have laws of physics that tell us how the moon moves around the earth. %$* 236
and they work very well. %$* 236
it is conceivable that there are also angels living inside the moon, gliding it around in exactly the way that newton's laws tell us. %$* 236
but we don't take that seriously as an idea, because there's no need for it or evidence for it. %$* 236
so, the question is not is it conceivable that there are other realms. %$* 236
the question is, is the evidence in favor of that other realm so overwhelming that it causes us to dismiss the enormous successes of physics, chemistry, biology and neuroscience? %$* 236
no. %$* 235
i would say absolutely not. %$* 235
it doesn't require you to dismiss the findings of science to – %$* 235
come over here to this side. %$* 236
we'll welcome you. %$* 236
we'll put your chair over here-- %$* 236
and yet, you know, i think it's entirely conceivable that there's some other domain of existence over this that some people gain access to it sometimes. %$* 235
and i know hundreds and hundreds of them. %$* 235
and how would we know if there weren't? %$* 236
you know something? %$* 235
you're right about the false of viability problem, sean. %$* 235
that's very big in the afterlife question. %$* 235
but i think the way that this is going to work out is that what we need to do is prepare people in advance, before they ever have a near death experience, in new ways of thinking about these things. %$* 235
you know, the standard-- %$* 235
the standard objection to mystical experience has always been-- %$* 235
as a.j. ayer put it-- %$* 235
that if the mystic tells us that he can't possibly describe what he experienced, then he's got to admit that he's talking unintelligibly when he talks about it. %$* 235
and that's the problem that we can change, because i think it's-- %$* 235
but-- %$* 13
but raymond-- %$* 13
but your argument said-- %$* 13
and i'm not taking sides on this, but my role in this, to some degree, is to push the arguments on both sides. %$* 13
you were-- %$* 13
what you were saying sort of reminds me of the editorial to virginia about santa claus, written in the 19th century, in which francis church wrote this editorial, said to the little girl, "do you see fairies dancing on the front lawn? %$* 13
no, of course you don't, but that doesn't mean that they're not there." and i feel, to some degree, that's the argument you're presenting is-- %$* 13
"no, we can't prove it, but that doesn't mean it's not real." %$* 13
what my argument-- %$* 235
and i just need you, again, to come close to the mic. %$* 13
yes. %$* 235
yes. %$* 235
my argument is that when thousands and thousands of people whose judgment i trust and other-- %$* 235
in all other circumstances, a lot of medical friends-- %$* 235
okay. %$* 13
give us one example, because i know you've written about this, examples where people who were not the person lying in the bed, but other people-- %$* 13
okay. %$* 235
had an experience. %$* 13
and let the other side respond to that. %$* 13
okay. %$* 235
and just lean into that mic. %$* 13
and artist i met a couple of years ago, jeff olson, by name, a very well-known graphic artist, had a horrific car crash in which he lost his leg, he-- %$* 235
his wife was killed instantly, and he had a profound near-death experience. %$* 235
as he was thinking about this, what am i going to do about this? %$* 235
" his doctor had not been informed about this. %$* 235
so he decided to write this story up, and then he wanted to use the name of his doctor. %$* 235
so he called the doctor and invited him to lunch. %$* 235
the doctor came and jeff told him the store i have his near-death experience, whereupon the surgeon said, "well, i've never told anybody this, but that night you were in the hospital i knew that you weren't going to die. %$* 235
your wife was talking with me in the surgery room. %$* 235
and the-- %$* 235
his dead wife. %$* 13
yes. %$* 235
and so did the scrub nurse also had an experience of vivid sense of presence and seeing the-- %$* 235
so my point here is that it's not proof, but at a certain point, you know, where do you draw the line and-- %$* 235
okay. %$* 13
give people respect? %$* 235
so you put an example out there where it's not simply about the brain activity of the person lying in the bed, but that the notion of an afterlife represented by this apparition, we are talking about ghosts now, and i'm sorry that sounded pejorative, but we are talking about something that a lot of people would challenge as incredibly implausible. %$* 13
but you’re making the argument seriously, so i want your opponents to respond to it seriously. %$* 13
well, we want to know what's really, really true, not just what seems to be true, what we want to be true. %$* 237
and, you know, again, our brains are narrative generating machines. %$* 237
it tries to construct a story that makes sense to us, appeals to us, stream-- %$* 237
puts everything together seamlessly. %$* 237
and you know, we can have what we believe-- %$* 237
we have memories of experiences that mean something to us, but don't really relate to reality. %$* 237
we know this is true. %$* 237
if you accept that level of evidence-- %$* 237
and this is not about respect. %$* 237
i believe that people have these memories of these experiences. %$* 237
it's just about the interpretation of them. %$* 237
are you talking about the scrub nurse and the doctors? %$* 13
anyone. %$* 237
i mean, think about it. %$* 237
but these scrub nurse and doctors were at separate-- %$* 13
met this woman at separate places, right, on the same night. %$* 13
but all we have is a story constructed after the fact. %$* 237
we have similar stories about people being abducted by ufos, seeing big foot, any weird kind of experience you can imagine. %$* 237
if you accept this level of evidence, then you have to believe every paranormal claim out there because we have that level of evidence for thousands of stories that are conflicting in mutually exclusive, often culturally dependent. %$* 237
it's simply not acceptable. %$* 237
and we know-- %$* 237
we know for a fact that the brain can absolutely manufacture those memories, come to absolutely believe a story like that, that's absolutely not true. %$* 237
i want to go to audience questions. %$* 13
and while you're raising hands, i just want to ask very, very quickly for eben alexander, do we know that the brain can manufacture those experiences? %$* 13
i would say the brain does not create consciousness. %$* 234
that is something a lot of scientists, those interested in neuroscience are far along that pathway. %$* 234
now it's called the hard problem of consciousness. %$* 234
in fact, no neuroscientist on earth can give the first sentence to explain the mechanism by which the physical brain creates consciousness. %$* 234
we don't have to know how the brain creates consciousness. %$* 237
steven novella. %$* 13
in order to know that it creates consciousness. %$* 237
that it creates consciousness, we absolutely know, just like we don't have to know how the earth generates gravity to know that it generates gravity. %$* 237
there's no question we have gravity even though we haven't untangled the deepest understanding of every possible thing. %$* 237
so yes, we don't know exactly how the brain creates consciousness, but the evidence can only lead to one interpretation, that it is consciousness. %$* 237
the consciousness is what the brain does, no question. %$* 237
eben alexander. %$* 13
as i said, no neuroscientist on earth can give the first sentence to explain a mechanism by which the physical brain gives rise to consciousness. %$* 234
but not knowing the mechanism-- %$* 237
is that-- %$* 13
is that true? %$* 13
i don't-- %$* 237
i disagree with that because there are-- %$* 237
there's consciousness research. %$* 237
there are researchers who are doing a very good job of making progress of understanding consciousness as a neurological phenomenon. %$* 237
we certainly are not all the way there of understanding exactly what it is. %$* 237
it's a very difficult nut to crack. %$* 237
but that we are not at the-- %$* 237
but not knowing the mechanism is not the same thing as saying it's not possible, or it's impossible, or we need a nonphysical mechanism. %$* 237
we certainly don't. %$* 237
given that point, but is he accurate that we don't know the mechanism by which the brain gives rise to consciousness? %$* 13
well, it's not a black or white thing. %$* 237
we have some knowledge. %$* 237
we don't have complete knowledge about it. %$* 237
it's like saying, do we understand-- %$* 237
do we understand everything about genetics? %$* 237
no. %$* 237
but we know that dna is the molecule of inheritance. %$* 237
that's not questionable. %$* 237
but not one sentence. %$* 234
give the first sentence of how you would trace from the physical brain that it gives rise to consciousness. %$* 234
let's go to some audience questions. %$* 13
right down front here. %$* 13
a mic will come to you. %$* 13
i didn't explain this before. %$* 13
a mic will come to you. %$* 13
and if you can stand up, tell us your name, and then give birth to a perfect formed question. %$* 13
hello. %$* 18
hi. %$* 18
my name is arthur kramer. %$* 18
my question is to the panel arguing for the motion. %$* 18
if a person was to take a strong hallucinogen, let's say lsd, and they were to have a very distorted experience, hallucinations, would you accept their version of reality, or would you just merely dismiss it as them having an experience because of-- %$* 18
that was a perfect formed question. %$* 13
and very relevant. %$* 13
which of you would like to take it? %$* 13
raymond moody. %$* 13
yeah, i think william james was kind of right about that, that whatever experience one has one can say that by definition almost there's some correlated state of the central nervous system. %$* 235
the question of reality is an entirely different question. %$* 235
can i imagine that maybe by taking some substance someone could gain access to some other kind of reality? %$* 235
yes, i can imagine that. %$* 235
however, i think it boils down to the particular, doesn't it? %$* 235
i think you have to look at a much broader set of information to make a-- %$* 235
but generally speaking, yeah. %$* 235
i don't think this side needs to add to that. %$* 13
i think your side was in the question. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 18
sir. %$* 13
you were starting to stand up. %$* 13
well, you too. %$* 13
i'll come back to you. %$* 13
richard spencer. %$* 18
i've got a question for eben and specifically about the issue of other people having experiences. %$* 18
eben, in your experience, you seem to have met your biological sister who you had never met before or seen a picture of. %$* 18
and i gather from your book that you actually drew a picture of her or somehow had a picture done before you subsequently had an actual picture of who she was, which you learned later. %$* 18
i'd like you to describe that in a little bit and say if in fact you-- %$* 18
i'm going to pass on that question because it's not going to-- %$* 13
i don't think it's going to advance our understanding of whether science relates to this or not, but thanks very much. %$* 13
ma'am in the center there. %$* 13
is your book on sale in our lobby? %$* 13
i like always being able to say that. %$* 13
i have no idea. %$* 235
it should be out there somewhere. %$* 235
if you have-- %$* 13
if you have no idea, that's a no. %$* 13
it's downloadable. %$* 13
and the story that was just brought up can be-- %$* 13
can be read in the book in great and compelling detail. %$* 13
ma'am. %$* 13
okay. %$* 19
hi. %$* 19
my name is eleanor. %$* 19
and i have a question for this side as well. %$* 19
i did read both of your books, by the way, which are super interesting. %$* 19
but it left me with a question which hasn't been answered yet, so why wouldn't everyone that experiences a death experience or a near-death experience have one of these experiences? %$* 19
right. %$* 13
it's about one out of ten or one out of eight, something like that. %$* 13
right. %$* 19
why wouldn't-- %$* 19
who comes back. %$* 13
more people have-- %$* 19
and why is there no mention of hell? %$* 19
it's all about heaven, which could be a good thing. %$* 19
but-- %$* 19
i think this side has an answer to that question. %$* 13
eben alexander, would you like to take that? %$* 13
well, i think that, to me, is a very interesting question. %$* 234
the number out there is roughly 15 percent, 20 percent of people who have a medical situation that might lead to a near-death experience, about 15 to 20 percent seem to report them. %$* 234
that's a historical figure that i think is probably low because it comes from an era when we weren't asking people to volunteer that kind of information. %$* 234
i think the actual number is probably higher. %$* 234
if i had just come back from my earthworm eye view, you know, that very prolonged initial phase, that very dumbed- down consciousness that i think was the best my brain could do, i would have had a hellish nde. turns out that hellish ndes are probably, what-- %$* 234
just remind people. %$* 13
3 or 4 percent. %$* 234
nde stands for near-death-- %$* 13
a near-death experience. %$* 234
and the hellish ones are quite rare by comparison, 3 or 4 percent. %$* 234
my own feeling is that that is because they're incomplete, that souls don't go in with quite the oomph and that exactly in my case, i went in with plenty of oomph and went through that phase and up into the much higher levels of ultra-reality. %$* 234
i think the other side should get a crack at this question and why it's only one out of eight or one out of 10 people who have had these experiences, %$* 13
yeah, i mean, it’s perfectly compatible with the neuroscientific hypothesis of these experiences depends on what parts of your brain are working and not working at any given moment. %$* 237
what's the mechanism of your being in a coma or unconscious? %$* 237
was it traumatic? %$* 237
was it lack of oxygen? %$* 237
you know, we could put pilots in a centrifuge, spin them up until they pass out-- %$* 237
a lot of them have near-death experiences, too, they're not near death, but we're depriving their brain of blood flow-- %$* 237
you know, with similar numbers, very, you know, profound, memorable, vivid experiences. %$* 237
so it just depends on the particulars of what parts of the brain are working or not working. %$* 237
and nobody's seeing hell, whew. %$* 13
some people have-- %$* 18
but there is hell. %$* 18
yeah, %$* 18
there is-- %$* 234
as i said, 3 or 4 percent of people have hellish ndes. %$* 234
i believe-- %$* 234
i believe there's actually a reality to that realm, to those lower spiritual realms, that you can see referred to back in the tibetan book of the dead, egyptian book of the dead. %$* 234
i mean, it's something that's been referred to for a long time. %$* 234
okay. %$* 13
depends on your amygdala activity. %$* 18
right down in front here. %$* 13
if anybody's upstairs, i apologize i can't see you at-- %$* 13
whatsoever. %$* 13
but if you'd like to ask a question, i see you come to the doors to the rear downstairs, i will try to call on you. %$* 13
what is the one thing that you would need to know that would make you believe them, even a little bit? %$* 19
so-- %$* 18
i just want to clarify that as a question to the side arguing against the motion. %$* 13
steven novella. %$* 13
for me, you know, i'm open to evidence for anything. %$* 237
what i would need to see is some information that the people having the experience gained through no other mechanism. %$* 237
so-- %$* 237
and there are experiments ongoing-- %$* 237
preliminary ones have been negative, there are bigger ones ongoing-- %$* 237
to see if people could, for example, look up on the top shelf and see a card that's placed there, that you could only see if you were actually floating above, near the ceiling, so that would be compelling evidence. %$* 237
i mean, it would need to be enough to-- %$* 237
that would be enough to me to at least take it seriously, but then to be - - to say that it's probably true, you need as much evidence as we have for the neuroscientific model which says it's not possible. %$* 237
steven novella, could you be convinced? %$* 13
is there any piece of evidence that would convince you that there's an afterlife? %$* 13
i could be convinced of anything if the evidence were sufficient. %$* 237
i'm sorry, i meant to ask your partner, but thank you for your answer. %$* 13
sean carroll, would-- %$* 13
could you be convinced? %$* 13
yeah, i think that-- %$* 236
you know, the idea that we could be convinced of another realm in addition to the natural world is obviously, "yes." there's a million pieces of evidence that would help convince me. %$* 236
none of-- %$* 236
i mean, if this-- %$* 236
if there's a ghost in the room that could lift up that glass right now, then i would be convinced. %$* 236
for those listening on the radio, the glass is not moving, and it-- %$* 236
it never moves when you do this. %$* 236
and we live in a world that looks exactly like there's only the natural world. %$* 236
but wouldn't you really kind of like those guys to be right? %$* 13
wouldn't it be great? %$* 13
yes and no. %$* 236
i think that there is obviously advantages. %$* 236
now, what would be the disadvantages? %$* 13
i don't want to die. %$* 236
i want to live after i die, maybe not for infinity years but for a few hundred thousand years i could amuse myself. %$* 236
sadly, as a very wise philosopher once said, "you can't always get what you want." %$* 236
i want to remind you, we are in the question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan, your moderator. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, arguing it out over this motion, "death is not final." let's go back to questions. %$* 13
ma'am-- %$* 13
sir, right up there, if you could stand-- %$* 13
yes, thanks. %$* 13
oh, hi. %$* 19
hi. %$* 19
could you step out just-- %$* 13
because it's a little dark where you are-- %$* 13
yeah, sure. %$* 19
step into the light, ma'am. %$* 13
hi. %$* 19
move to the light. %$* 13
i'm andrea, hello. %$* 19
i wanted to ask a question to the pro side, which is what is your definition of "final," because in your description of what it was like in this what you called sort of a transcendental state you were feeling things but it didn't seem as if you could do anything, as if you were really talking to anyone. %$* 19
so i wanted to know what your definition of "final" is. %$* 19
how will that help you vote on the motion seriously? %$* 13
because, you know, the motion is "death is not final," so they have to convince me that there's something beyond when the body, you know, decomposes into the earth, so that doesn't end what we know to be life, so i wanted to know-- %$* 19
but i think-- %$* 13
i'm going to pass because i think that's the thrust of their entire argument is that, that-- %$* 13
unless i'm really missing your point, have argued is that "death is not final." am i missing something? %$* 13
i just-- %$* 19
oh, i had hoped for some clarification on their definition of "final," but if it seems as if-- %$* 19
i'm going to pass on it because i think-- %$* 13
right down there. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
i'm michael, and, dr. %$* 18
moody, in your opening comments you said that we-- %$* 18
you believe we're on the verge of understanding through philosophy and logic this other realm. %$* 18
can you elaborate on that? %$* 18
yes. %$* 235
i think that probably about one out of five people i meet socially-- %$* 235
and when the conversation develops, "so, what do you do? %$* 235
" "i write books on near death experiences"-- %$* 235
about one out of 10 people say, "oh, i don't believe in life after death. %$* 235
when you're dead, you're dead." then i go on and i ask them, "well, how did you reach that conclusion? %$* 235
" most of them say, "what are you talking about in the first place, life after death? %$* 235
it's just illogical." and you know, the sentence "there is life after death" is a self-contradiction, if you look up the words in the dictionary. %$* 235
and this may sound trivial, but this is really a major problem, because that-- %$* 235
it helps us understand why life after death is not yet a scientific question. %$* 235
question is one of intelligibility. %$* 235
what does it mean? %$* 235
and the person, i think, who stated that point of view most eloquently was david hume, who said, "by the mere light of reason it seems difficult to prove the immortality of the soul." then he went on to say, "some new species of logic is requisite for that purpose. %$* 235
and some new faculties of the mind that they may enable us to comprehend that logic." that sounds like a tall order, but it's not really that difficult. %$* 235
the trouble is that you have to stop thinking about stories for a while and beautiful narratives, and really get busy with some conceptual thinking. %$* 235
but when that's all said and done, i think that we do now have new ways of thinking about things that are illogical that will open up entirely new ways to investigate the afterlife question. %$* 235
this is not geared to the afterlife, per say. %$* 235
what somebody who wants to go through this pathway has to do-- %$* 235
first is to say, "what i'm going to focus here is on learning new logical principles and going through a process of learning." then, as a corollary, much later down the road, this has implications for the afterlife question. %$* 235
we're going-- %$* 13
we're going to book you in about seven years and see where that-- %$* 13
see where that process is. %$* 13
let me go to more questions. %$* 13
sir? %$* 13
my name's rob. %$* 18
my question is for the against side. %$* 18
thank you. %$* 18
how can you be so sure about your position when you base it upon what we now know in science-- %$* 18
and by the mere fact of what we now know, we're constantly evolving in science? %$* 18
so, how can you base-- %$* 18
be so sure about your position when science may learn things that we don't yet know? %$* 18
well, i mean-- %$* 18
that's a pretty-- %$* 13
that's a pretty good question. %$* 13
that's a good question. %$* 18
yeah. %$* 13
steven novella. %$* 13
so, as i said-- %$* 237
as i was saying, i'm a skeptic, so i'm in a perpetual state of doubt about everything. %$* 237
i need lots of evidence and logic to convince me. %$* 237
and all we could say within the scientific realm is what does the best evidence tell us today? %$* 237
right now, we have lots of evidence that we could be highly confident in the conclusion that the mind is what the brain does. %$* 237
and we have no compelling evidence-- %$* 237
only narratives and really dubious evidence to-- %$* 237
against that proposition, against that notion, or for the notion that there is some consciousness separate from the brain. %$* 237
so, the scientific conclusion today is that the mind is the brain. %$* 237
if new, dramatic evidence comes to light that changes that, i will happily move along with the evidence. %$* 237
sean caroll, take a crack at the same question. %$* 13
i think-- %$* 236
you know, it's a great question because there's this image-- %$* 236
like, when we're teaching high school and science, that it's a bunch of facts that are absolutely established, whereas professional scientists like to brag about the fact that-- %$* 236
like steven just said-- %$* 236
that, you know, we're always skeptical and we're always ready to throw out everything. %$* 236
and both are true, but because there's some intermediate ground. %$* 236
there are many, many things that science does not understand, and we're hoping to get better at it. %$* 236
many, many things. %$* 236
and there are also some things that science does understand and are not going to go away. %$* 236
this table is made of atoms. %$* 236
we will improve our understanding of what an atom is, what the elemental particles and fields are that make it up, how they interact. %$* 236
that is not finished yet. %$* 236
we can do better. %$* 236
but a million years from now, our best scientific understanding will still say that the table is made of atoms. %$* 236
in my judgment, the current status of our scientific understanding, the parts that we're not going to give up, are enough to conclude that death is, in fact, final. %$* 236
i want to remind you, we are in the question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan, your moderator. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, arguing it out over this motion-- %$* 13
death is not final. %$* 13
did somebody come downstairs? %$* 13
he did. %$* 13
i see standing there. %$* 13
again, i need you to walk to the light. %$* 13

so, i guess if we’re going to argue about these implications, one question is, why truncate it if this data seems to suggest that the common core is going to have fewer children ready to complete their educations? %$* 252
mike petrilli. %$* 13
right so, let’s go back to the question about testing. %$* 250
rick is right, that there are a number of states out there, that because of political pressure, mostly from the political right, have decided to pull back from the common core testing. %$* 250
right, it’s because that’s the position you are arguing. %$* 250
your position is being heard in red states and they are saying, therefore we’re not going to do these better tests. %$* 250
we’re going to do our own tests. %$* 250
because we don’t want anything involved with the federal government. %$* 250
we’re afraid of all kinds of other issues. %$* 250
my argument is that those states have not embraced the common core. %$* 250
they have not fully embraced the common core. %$* 250
because you cannot embrace higher standards if you don’t also embrace better assessments. %$* 250
but mike, embracing the common core. %$* 252
they go together. %$* 250
embracing the common core, does embracing the common core mean embracing a national cut score? %$* 252
it means embracing a rigorous standard . %$* 250
no, no, no. %$* 252
does it mean embracing a national, because otherwise, states can use a common core tests, which are still very much of unproven quality, as i think you’ve publicly conceded. %$* 252
we don’t know if they’re good tests or not. %$* 252
but you can use those tests and still make up your own cut score, and still three extra months of instruction. %$* 252
so the idea that you are now getting honest clear apples to apples comparisons because you have used, it is just simply. %$* 252
then i am excited. %$* 250
what i think i’m hearing rick, is that you agree with our position, that we should embrace the common core, embrace good assessment and make sure that the states are %$* 250
no, no, no, no, no. %$* 13
no, he actually asked a really good specific question. %$* 13
which is, if the common core is embraced from california to maine to florida, to alabama to montana, does the kid in montana have to get the same score, to get, on the same test, to get past through the high school, as the kid in alabama? %$* 13
right. %$* 250
i would prefer that kind of policy. %$* 250
and it looks like the states that are doing the parcc test, as far as we can tell, are going to agree to a common cut score. %$* 250
we’re not sure yet about smarter balance. %$* 250
i think even those other states, even those that don’t have great tests, all signs are, even those are going to have much more challenging cut scores than they had before. %$* 250
so we will have made some progress on these issues. %$* 250
but look, rick, i would love- %$* 250
that’s a yes. %$* 13
that is a yes. %$* 250
okay, you got a yes on that. %$* 13
are you surprised by that? %$* 13
now where do you go? %$* 13
i mean i think, frankly, i think this is part of it. %$* 252
i think not embracing the common core is to say look, a number of states should do the common core and they should do it uncompromisingly and aggressively. %$* 252
and we should see if their children actually benefit. %$* 252
how long do you want to wait? %$* 250
i’d like, i’d like, i’d like-- %$* 252
you know, i wrote a book, in my harvard dissertation, close to 20 years ago, called spinning wheels. %$* 252
pointed out that the average urban school system in the united states launched 13 major reform waves between ’92 and ’95.that is the history of education at stake, that we excitedly tout a new thing, an exciting thing, no child left behind, or reading verse, or comprehensive school reform. %$* 252
we have to rush it out, into lots of venues and lots of sites. %$* 252
and then when it doesn’t work, we go oh gosh, but we got another one for you. %$* 252
for once, just for once, i would like us to actually try to keep the common core. %$* 252
follow through on what we started? %$* 250
excuse me? %$* 252
you’d like us to follow through on what we started? %$* 250
oh, well. %$* 13
i have a quick question. %$* 19
i’m the mother of a special needs child. %$* 19
i am also a teacher of english language learners. %$* 19
but my question is, are these standards copyrighted? %$* 19
and as a result of that, can teachers veer off the script? %$* 19
that's my question. %$* 19
let's take it to carmel martin. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 249
they are not copyrighted. %$* 249
they're open. %$* 249
and teachers-- %$* 249
i think where we see common core being implemented effectively, teachers aren't following a script. %$* 249
what we see is that the-- %$* 249
as i said in my opening, the standards create guide posts, a destination. %$* 249
and teachers are able to then construct lessons so they can differentiate for the children in their class. %$* 249
we have heard very positive things from teachers of special ed students, that in some ways, they're better than the old way because it allows you to get the answer through different methodologies-- %$* 249
and math, for example, it's-- %$* 249
allows for different ways to get to the answer. %$* 249
so, i would say that they should not feel scripted. %$* 249
i do think, in some places, with that-- %$* 249
with those bad instructional leadership, they're being given scripts and told to follow the script. %$* 249
but i don't think that's the right way to implement the standards. %$* 249
and i don't think the standards themselves dictate that. %$* 249
i think the standards really try to shift in the direction of giving teachers more freedom, like the teacher that i quoted in my opening had mentioned. %$* 249
carol burris. %$* 13
the common core standards most certainly are copyrighted. %$* 251
they are. %$* 251
and i really-- %$* 251
all of you. %$* 251
go online tonight and look. %$* 251
you're going to see that they're copyrighted. %$* 251
they're not allowed to be changed. %$* 251
when they're adopted by states, states may add 15 percent, but they cannot change any of the standards. %$* 251
that's one of the problems. %$* 251
second, in terms of scripts, if you look, in new york state, engage new york, we spent over $28 million for curriculum. %$* 251
and that curriculum is full of script. %$* 251
and those scripts-- %$* 251
at engage new york, at least you publicly praised when you've talked to-- %$* 251
i think it was the governor's commission, you said how wonderful engage new york is. %$* 251
they truly are scripts. %$* 251
and we find so many teachers who are so afraid to go off-script, to not teach exactly what-- %$* 251
all right. %$* 13
engage new york says-- %$* 251
you've made the point-- %$* 13
unfortunately, i want to let-- %$* 13
i want to let carmel respond. %$* 13
or mike petrilli. %$* 13
sure. %$* 250
let's talk about-- %$* 250
michael petrilli. %$* 13
new york is an interesting case, because it is the only state in the country that has developed a fully fleshed out curriculum. %$* 250
and i think you can certainly make the case that it's too fleshed out. %$* 250
and out-- %$* 250
and good administrators will tell their teachers, "hey, use it as a resource. %$* 250
and it's there for you. %$* 250
but by no means should you be following it word-by-word," okay? %$* 250
you know, it-- %$* 250
most states have the opposite problem, which is that there's nothing. %$* 250
there's nothing been developed, and teachers are saying, "i'm desperate for something to help me teach to these standards." and what those teachers usually use is engage new york. %$* 250
we have a-- %$* 13
we have to wrap up this section of the debate, but before we do, i want to bring a question in from an npr listener. %$* 13
it's a question for the against side. %$* 13
i'm not going to give you time to answer it, because i just want to let it linger, because i like the question. %$* 13
it's great-- %$* 13
it's great to think schools are incubators for new ideas, but what if you're in a school system with subpar teachers and administration? %$* 13
surely not all principals are like carol. %$* 13
something to consider. %$* 13
and that concludes round 2 of this intelligence squared u.s.debate, where our motion is embrace the common core. %$* 13
and here's where we are. %$* 13
we are about to hear closing statements from each debater. %$* 13
they will be two minutes each. %$* 13
and remember how you voted before the debate. %$* 13
immediately after the closing statements, they will-- %$* 13
we will have you vote again. %$* 13
and this is their last chance here now, for them to change your minds. %$* 13
onto round 3, closing statements. %$* 13
from each debater in turn. %$* 13
our motion is this-- %$* 13
embrace the common core. %$* 13
and here to give you his summarizing statement in support of this motion, mike petrilli, president of the thomas p. fordham institute. %$* 13
great. %$* 250
thank you, john. %$* 250
and thank you so much to rick, and carol, and carmel for this great discussion. %$* 250
it's-- %$* 250
it is so nice for a change to have a discussion about the common core that is so substantive, because unfortunately, that's not been what's happening for much of the last couple of years. %$* 250
i just want to say to some of the points that rick and carol made. %$* 250
they're very smart to go and to look at some of the specific standards that they've got questions about. %$* 250
and as we said at the beginning, there's no doubt, the common core are not perfect, nor are they set in stone. %$* 250
you look at states around the country, they have found ways to add to the standards. %$* 250
florida, for example, adding calculus to their math standards because of some of the concerns that rick made. %$* 250
totally legitimate. %$* 250
other states adding cursive, because parents have been concerned we're not teaching cursive. %$* 250
there are no common core cops. %$* 250
states are free to do that, and they should do that. %$* 250
and they should make them their own. %$* 250
but i want to talk again about what happens on the other side of this if you go backwards. %$* 250
rick is right. %$* 250
rick's book, "spinning wheels," you should read it. %$* 250
it's a classic, right? %$* 250
you want to see spinning wheels? %$* 250
go check out oklahoma right now, because that's where you have spinning wheels, because the legislature decided out of political pressure to pull back on these standards. %$* 250
you listen to jeannetta jante she's a english language arts teacher at oklahoma city's southeast high school, she called that decision a "travesty." she says, quote, "now it's like we've wasted teacher training, teacher time, lesson planning, resources, all of those things we've just done. %$* 250
the senators have basically said, 'oops, sorry, we didn't mean for you to do all of that.'the chaos in the classrooms will be great. %$* 250
the chaos in the classrooms will be great." okay, we are four years into this. %$* 250
and many, many teachers, millions of teachers across the country are working hard at making common core work. %$* 250
we should follow through now on what we have started. %$* 250
we should make it better as we go. %$* 250
we should address problems and challenges. %$* 250
but we should embrace the common core. %$* 250
thank you. %$* 250
thank you, mike petrilli. %$* 13
and that's our motion, "embrace the common core." and here to summarize her position against this motion, carol burris. %$* 13
she is principal of south side high school in rockville centre, new york. %$* 13
well, you know what, there probably is a mess down in oklahoma. %$* 251
but in ohio what they're doing is they're considering adopting the standards of massachusetts. %$* 251
doesn't need to be a mess. %$* 251
it doesn't. %$* 251
about 10 years ago my husband and i bought a new car. %$* 251
it was gorgeous. %$* 251
it was silver. %$* 251
it had heated leather seats, a great steering wheel, lots of pep. %$* 251
i loved that car. %$* 251
and then one night when we were coming home about a month after we bought it, it broke down. %$* 251
the oil light went on. %$* 251
took us 10 minutes to get the car going again. %$* 251
brought it into the station. %$* 251
they tweaked it a little bit. %$* 251
and they sent us on our way. %$* 251
well, six months later the car broke down again, and this time when we brought it in, they weren't quite so nice. %$* 251
they started asking us, "well, what kind of oil were you using? %$* 251
" a year later, same thing happened, car stopped, oil light went on. %$* 251
we couldn't get it started. %$* 251
the car had to be hauled in. %$* 251
now we said we wanted the oil pump repaired, and all of a sudden they started talking about how maybe we had not kept it up properly. %$* 251
we just had not implemented that car the right way. %$* 251
well, the bottom line was when we looked online we found out that a lot of other people were having the same problem. %$* 251
we bought a lemon. %$* 251
we bought a lemon. %$* 251
but luckily, luckily, there were other cars for us to buy. %$* 251
i have to tell you, from my perspective, 25 years as an educator of i think one of the finest schools in the country, the common core is a lemon-- %$* 251
and the problem is because it is on a national scale it's the only car that they want to have on the lot. %$* 251
our kids deserve better than this. %$* 251
they deserve new ideas. %$* 251
they deserve new approaches. %$* 251
they deserve differentiation. %$* 251
and they certainly don't deserve what has happened in new york where only 30 percent of the kids are deemed to be proficient based on an insane standard. %$* 251
carol burris, i'm sorry your time is up. %$* 13
okay, don't embrace the common core. %$* 251
thank you very much. %$* 13
"embrace the common core," is our motion, and here to summarize her position in support of the motion, carol martin, she is executive vice president for policy at the center for american progress. %$* 13
thanks, john. %$* 249
i'm sorry, i want to redo that because i just mispronounced-- %$* 13
misspoke your name. %$* 13
i'm just going to do it again for the radio broadcast so that, that never happened. %$* 13
okay. %$* 249
the miracle of editing. %$* 13
and here to summarize her position for the motion, carmel martin, executive vice president for policy at the center for american progress. %$* 13
thank you, john. %$* 249
as a mom and a former civil rights attorney, i've seen firsthand the consequences of low expectations and their long term effects. %$* 249
our children do deserve more. %$* 249
they deserve to be taught to the level that they need to be successful in college and career, and that's the overarching goal of these standards, and there's lots of evidence to support that it will get them to where they need to be. %$* 249
the common core gives teachers the space to create an exciting classroom experience for all rooted high expectations, project-based learning, problem solving, and exploring concepts deeply instead of focusing on worksheets and rote memorization. %$* 249
if this were 2012, all four of us-- %$* 249
all four of the panelists here would be in agreement that we should not repeal the common core. %$* 249
carol said as recently as 2012 that higher level thinking is more prominent in the common core than in all present state standards. %$* 249
and rick said just last week that he was not necessarily saying to pull out of the common core. %$* 249
i think what he's saying tonight is the jury is out. %$* 249
what mike and i are saying is to-- %$* 249
let's keep moving forward because our children can't afford to wait any longer for higher standards, and they can't rely on extraordinary principles or teachers to help them get there. %$* 249
the achievement gaps in our country are staggering, and it's time to tackle them aggressively. %$* 249
your vote tonight will be closely watched and folks outside of this theater may not understand all of the nuance of rick and carol's position. %$* 249
a vote to not embrace the common core will be interpreted as a vote to repeal the common core altogether. %$* 249
and as mike said, we do not believe that there are good alternatives to that. %$* 249
there are real consequences to this decision, higher versus lower standards, new expenses in changing course, frustration for countless educators. %$* 249
those consequences should be at the forefront of your decision. %$* 249
students who come to high school, falling behind, only one in 10 of them get to catch up, according to a recent act study. %$* 249
we need to get to them earlier. %$* 249
okay. %$* 249
thanks, john. %$* 249
carmel martin, i'm sorry, your time is up. %$* 13
i urge you to "embrace the common core." %$* 249
well done, thank you. %$* 13
carmel martin. %$* 13
and that's our motion, "embrace the common core," and here to summarize his position against this motion, rick hess. %$* 13
he is director of educational policy studies at the american enterprise institute. %$* 13
thanks, john, it's a pleasure to be with all of you this evening. %$* 252
mike, carmel, thanks for a terrific conversation. %$* 252
mike and carmel tonight have repeatedly suggested that the common core is right on the big things, that all of the concerns, the tests, the curricula, the instruction are glitches, they're bumps in the road, they're things to be worked out. %$* 252
for me, having done this for a while, this all brings to mind the advice offered by a thoughtful pundit a few years ago on another major reform effort, no child left behind. %$* 252
on reflecting on nclb, this pundit, who had enthusiastically championed it until he soured on it penned a terrific chapter for a book of mine, titled, "the problem with implementation," is the problem. %$* 252
the author was our own mike petrilli. %$* 252
in this chapter, mike observed the central task of no child left behind implementation is translating its aspirational statements in bold principles into action in the real world. %$* 252
to work well at the local level in real schools affecting real children, its contradictions must be resolved, its fuzzy notions must be made crystal clear. %$* 252
he wrote that when this fuzziness led to confusion, the fault must be placed on the law itself, not just on those charged with carrying it out. %$* 252
mike offered some terrific advice there on this whole question of whether to embrace these kinds of changes. %$* 252
he observed, "where the implementation of the law has gone most smoothly is where at least a handful of states and districts have already paved the way." i think that was great advice. %$* 252
i think common core, like no child left behind, certainly deserves its day in the sun. %$* 252
i'm not opposed to giving it a chance to show what it can do. %$* 252
happily, states have only begun implementation in earnest in most cases. %$* 252
until 2013, two thirds of american adults had never even heard of the common core. %$* 252
this is actually a propitious moment to hit pause, slow down, figure out what we're doing before we get too far downstream. %$* 252
for that reason, i'd like to ask you tonight to please vote against embracing the common core. %$* 252
thank you, rick hess. %$* 13
and that concludes our closing statements. %$* 13
and now it is time to learn which side you feel has argued the best. %$* 13
we're going to ask you again to go to the keypads at your seat. %$* 13
you've been through this once. %$* 13
it's the same thing. %$* 13
push number one if you agree with the motion, "embrace the common core." push number two if you disagree. %$* 13
push number three if you remain or even became undecided. %$* 13
and it will take-- %$* 13
that can happen. %$* 13
nothing wrong with that. %$* 13
and just-- %$* 13
if you make-- %$* 13
if you push the wrong key, correct yourself. %$* 13
the system will lock in your last vote, and we will lock the whole thing out in about 15 seconds. %$* 13
it looks like everybody's got it on top. %$* 13
okay, so we are about 90 seconds away from having the results. %$* 13
and in the meantime i just want to say a couple things. %$* 13
first of all, i really want to congratulate the spirit that the debaters brought to the stage tonight. %$* 13
it's clear that they had sharp disagreements. %$* 13
it's also really clear that they deeply agree in very fundamental ways about the big picture and that, that informed the civility and the intelligence that they brought to this argument on the stage tonight. %$* 13
i want to congratulate all of them for the way they did that. %$* 13
and to everyone who got up and asked a question, i think this is the first debate in a long, long time where i haven't thrown out a single question. %$* 13
they were, with a little bit of tweaking, they were all good and they were all informative. %$* 13
they led to a better debate for us, so thank you for those contributions, everybody in the audience. %$* 13
i’d love to have you, as i said in the beginning, please tweet about this debate. %$* 13
our twitter handle is @iq2us. %$* 13
our hashtag is commoncore. %$* 13
i want to let you know that we’ve just launched a new app that’s downloadable from the itunes store and from the iphone-- %$* 13
from the apple store and from the android store. %$* 13
the app store at google play. %$* 13
and this lets you not only get to all of our debates, it lets you vote on our debates, see what’s upcoming, so you can get background information, all on your smart phone. %$* 13
we just launched it about a week and a half ago, and i have to say it’s beautiful and elegant, and it’s intelligent. %$* 13
so, i hope you’ll take a look at it. %$* 13
our next debate is right here at the kauffman center. %$* 13
it’s on tuesday, september 30th. %$* 13
the motion that night will be this, flexing america’s muscles in the middle east will make things worse. %$* 13
our team arguing for that motion, aaron david miller. %$* 13
he is a former middle east negotiator. %$* 13
he served two decades at the department of state helping to formulate u.s.policy in the region. %$* 13
he is against flexing our muscle more in the region. %$* 13
his partner, paul pillar, a 28 year veteran of the u.s.intelligence community. %$* 13
he served as a national intelligence officer for the near east and south asia. %$* 13
arguing against them, michael doran. %$* 13
he has served on the national security council as senior director for near east and north africa. %$* 13
and brett stephens who is a pulitzer prize winning foreign affair columnist, deputy page editor for the wall street journal. %$* 13
again that motion is, flexing america’s muscles in the middle east will only make things worse. %$* 13
tuesday, october 7th we’ll be returning to philadelphia’s national constitution center. %$* 13
this is a new initiative in the last several months and the last year. %$* 13
intelligence squared is partnering with the national constitutional center, doing a specific kind of debate that has been really very successful. %$* 13
it’s where we take a constitutional cut at an issue today, by examining so far, we’ve examined twice, the application of specific amendments to things that are going on in policy and in the world. %$* 13
and they have been very, very interesting and successful. %$* 13
and i recommend using our app to go watch these debates. %$* 13
we’re doing one coming up on october 7th. %$* 13
the motion is this. %$* 13
the mass collection of u.s.phone records violates the fourth amendment. %$* 13
philadelphia is a 90 minute train ride. %$* 13
tickets for all debates are available from our website, iq2us.org. %$* 13
and of course, those who can’t join our live audience-- %$* 13
i’ll take that-- %$* 13
there are a lot of other ways to catch these debates. %$* 13
i’ve mentioned them. %$* 13
you can download the app. %$* 13
you can watch the live stream on our website, iq2us.org or listen to the debate on npr stations across the nation. %$* 13
and you can stay in touch with us on twitter and facebook. %$* 13
by the way we welcome your feedback and topic ideas. %$* 13
we’ve been getting a lot of them lately, and they’re very much in the mix, so we take it seriously. %$* 13
we’ve gotten some very good ideas that i think we’re going to launch into debates in the coming seasons, so please keep that up. %$* 13
all right so, so now it is all in. %$* 13
let me find my page on this. %$* 13
okay, it’s all in. %$* 13
i have been given the final results. %$* 13
you have been asked to vote twice on this motion, embrace the common core. %$* 13
once before you heard the arguments and once again after you heard the arguments. %$* 13
and by our rules, the team that wins is the team that has changed most minds in this hall in new york city in percentage point terms. %$* 13
so let’s get to the results. %$* 13
in the preliminary vote, embrace the common core, before the debate, 50 percent agreed with the motion, 13 percent were against, 37 percent were undecided. %$* 13
those are the first results. %$* 13
remember, you have to have changed the numbers more than your opponent in order to win, in percentage point terms. %$* 13
let’s look at the second vote. %$* 13
embrace the common core, the team arguing for the motion, their second vote was 67 percent. %$* 13
they went from 50 percent to 67 percent, a 17 percent increase. %$* 13
that is the number to beat in percentage points, 17 percent. %$* 13
let’s look at the team against the motion. %$* 13
their second vote was 27 percent, they pulled over 14 percentage points, but it was not enough. %$* 13
the debate goes to the team arguing for the motion, embrace the common core. %$* 13
our congratulations to them. %$* 13
thank you from john donvan and intelligence squared. %$* 13
we’ll see you next time. %$* 13

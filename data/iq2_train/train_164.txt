and what i would suggest to you is we are in this problem because the government made changes that took you and i out of the equation. %$* 459
the government said health insurance is available only if your employer buys it and you get a tax deduction. %$* 459
but if you go out and buy it, it’s one-third more expensive. %$* 459
if you can’t hire and fire somebody’s who delivering a service to you, you can’t hold it accountable including its costs. %$* 459
john, you’re saying there’s an issue of individual freedom here %$* 13
absolutely. %$* 459
the individual freedom is tied back to the cost of the service and because we can’t control it, you are controlling its cost. %$* 459
let me take your response to the other side, paul starr who worked for the clinton administration. %$* 13
i do think this is a question of our public philosophy and the obligations that we owe to one another. %$* 460
and it is, i think, a sad commentary on us that we remain the only advanced country that doesn’t provide protection to all of our citizens. %$* 460
now the reason that we have-- %$* 460
let’s go back to why we have this employer-based system. %$* 460
if you don’t have government share, spread the costs of healthcare, there needs to be some organization that serves as the pool for risk. %$* 460
and the employer is the most convenient way to do it. %$* 460
that’s actually why this first developed in the 1930s and ‘40s before we had the tax advantages. %$* 460
it’s simply going to default from the government to employers. %$* 460
it’s not as though the government took this away from individuals. %$* 460
that individual market that the congressman loves is phenomenally inefficient. %$* 460
but paul, what about your opponents point that as a nation, philosophically as a nation, we’re defined by a commitment to limited government and that this program actually assaults that notion? %$* 13
but it is a program, as i said before, that is trying to create a functioning market, a better functioning market than the one that currently exists. %$* 460
those exchanges will give people choices that they don’t now have. %$* 460
all the republicans are arguing is that you ought to give that choice to people. %$* 459
i do not favor individual purchase. %$* 459
that was the attack made against senator mccain throughout the campaign and it was absolutely unfair. %$* 459
i favor a plan which says i as an individual can buy an individual plan, i can take my employer’s plan or i can buy from a whole group of expanded choices. %$* 459
we could have my social club. %$* 459
the kiwanis club can offer a plan. %$* 459
my university alumni can offer a plan. %$* 459
give me that choice, force those insurance companies to compete. %$* 459
they don’t compete right now. %$* 459
they don’t care what you and i pay for health insurance and they don’t, quite frankly, care whether it treats us well. %$* 459
they only care that our employer bought the plan. %$* 459
jonathan cohn. %$* 13
jonathan cohn, arguing against repeal. %$* 13
well, i would say i think all of us favor choice. %$* 462
choice is a wonderful thing. %$* 462
we want to give choice. %$* 462
people who buy, i mean, we need to realize that the employer-- %$* 462
people who are getting private insurance are now divided into two groups. %$* 462
there are people who get it from their employers and there are people who buy it on their own. %$* 462
neither of them has choices right now. %$* 462
you’re buying insurance on your own? %$* 462
good luck buying a coverage policy. %$* 462
you’re going to have trouble finding one, particularly if you have pre-existing conditions. %$* 462
you’ve got to shop across state lines. %$* 459
we’ll talk about that in a second. %$* 462
this affordable care plan, what it does is it says, all right, let’s create a market, a real market, a place-- %$* 462
kind of like expedia, like they have in massachusetts now where everybody who’s buying one actually gets a choice of insurance programs, a set of plans that they know they can afford that will be made available to them regardless if they’re a cancer survivor and let all of those people shop. %$* 462
meanwhile, employers who have insurance for their employees will continue to provide that. %$* 462
look, at some point it is very easy to say we want to open up exchanges for everybody and let everybody shop. %$* 462
you can build on this system to do that. %$* 462
you can do that. %$* 462
but you’re never going to get to that system you’re talking about. %$* 462
you will never get to a system where people have choice and a choice of actual plans that are available to everybody, that cover what they need, until you build these exchanges that are in the affordable care act. %$* 462
douglas holtz-eaken. %$* 13
you’re against the plan. %$* 13
i want to ask you, what-- %$* 13
what do you think the public actually wants? %$* 13
i have no idea. %$* 461
let me just-- %$* 461
i would never speak for 300 million americans. %$* 461
and that's one of the beautiful things about this country. %$* 461
and i think the-- %$* 461
you know, i agree, obviously, with a lot of what jon has said. %$* 461
go back to the beginning of the evening when we were asked to think about end of life care. %$* 461
now, do you really think that americans want an insurance company making decisions about the end of life care? %$* 461
no. %$* 461
they've already seen that model and rejected it-- %$* 461
so you are telling us what americans want, or not. %$* 13
that you can't do that. %$* 461
they told us, i’ll read that evidence. %$* 461
i don't think they want the government making those decisions. %$* 461
i think we know who makes those decisions. %$* 461
it's the family. %$* 461
it's-- %$* 461
those are the only people who are ethically well situated to make those tough calls. %$* 461
and so we must, in the end, invest in families, the authority to make decisions, invest in them, their insurance. %$* 461
invest in them the information and the ability to make those decisions and center this system around families and americans, not around these large government entities. %$* 461
what does that mean in practice? %$* 461
i'm an economist. %$* 461
i mean, economists are practical people. %$* 461
you follow your nose and incentives. %$* 461
if i have an insurance policy when i'm 21, and then i develop an odd thing where i have to have my kidneys transplanted, i'm still on that insurance policy. %$* 461
any insurance company now has to recognize they've got me for life. %$* 461
it's not a one-year sign-up proposition where they can minimize on preventive care or they can try to cut off covering some things. %$* 461
they have to deal with the right lifetime incentives. %$* 461
pay for the cheap prevention up front. %$* 461
a lot of them eventually want to do that. %$* 461
and align the insurance and the medical incentives to transform the way we deliver medicine in america. %$* 461
that's what we need. %$* 461
and in the process, guess what? %$* 461
my insurance goes with me from job to job, job to home when i stayed home with my kids. %$* 461
you don't have to spend the whole time fighting over who works full time to get the insurance. %$* 461
it's madness. %$* 461
americans are rearranging their lives for the insurance. %$* 461
let's rearrange the insurance so it fits american lives. %$* 461
that's what this system will be. %$* 461
jonathan cohn, you said in your opening remarks-- %$* 13
jonathan cohn, you have said that the obama plan took the best from both left and right. %$* 13
give me one idea from the right that your opponents will recognize as an idea that is from their side, that they just love. %$* 13
sure, absolutely. %$* 462
well, first of all, to start, there's a pilot program funding for malpractice reform. %$* 462
you know, believe it or not, people who wrote the affordable care act, and i would include myself among this, actually believe that there is some money to be saved by reforming the malpractice system. %$* 462
so there's money out there for-- %$* 462
let me just take that to this side. %$* 13
do you recognize that as one of your ideas? %$* 13
can i just say the big problem-- %$* 461
douglas holtz-eakin. %$* 13
i will stipulate late one thing i want to get very clear on the table. %$* 461
i support exchanges. %$* 461
i support-- %$* 461
i always support good competitive markets. %$* 461
and you can build exchanges that enhance competition left to do that. %$* 461
there is a lot in the bill that is bipartisan. %$* 461
it's in the delivery system reforms, not in the coverage expansions which are madness. %$* 461
but they're all tiny. %$* 461
they're pilots. %$* 461
pilots have a terrible track record of actually turning into real policy. %$* 461
in fact the road to healthcare hell is paved with pilots and demonstrations. %$* 461
and that's a pilot and a demonstration for a known problem. %$* 461
if you've got a problem, fix it. %$* 461
the problem with this bill, it doesn't fix what we know is the issue, healthcare costs. %$* 461
instead, it's got a bunch of pilots that congress will never actually implement. %$* 461
and it doesn't fix the biggest source of our problem, which is the medicare system which pays for fragmentation, pays for overuse. %$* 461
it's a fee for service system. %$* 461
we have more problems created by those programs than this could ever solve. %$* 461
so what's the point of the program. %$* 13
i have to respond to this because really, you know, that's amazing for you to say about the medicare program. %$* 460
we had legislation under the republicans to reform medicare, to introduce private insurance plans into medicare. %$* 460
and what is the result? %$* 460
we now know that those plans cost medicare an extra $1,000 per beneficiary compared to what it would have cost medicare just to deal with them in a traditional program. %$* 460
so. %$* 460
this is a very important point. %$* 18
john you want to share some time with your-- %$* 13
no. %$* 461
i'd like to-- %$* 461
30 seconds of getting facts straight. %$* 461
the problem is the healthcare bill. %$* 461
medicare advantage is one way to shift it from one person to another. %$* 461
tax policy, which he said would save us money, doesn't. %$* 461
it just shifts the bill around from one person to another. %$* 461
the problem is the bill. %$* 461
this law does not change our healthcare bill. %$* 461
that's its issue. %$* 461
can i just say-- %$* 462
jonathan cohn. %$* 13
with all due-- %$* 462
did you read the bill? %$* 462
i mean, i-- %$* 462
is. %$* 462
and did you read the-- %$* 462
i know you've cited cbo reports. %$* 462
there are page-- %$* 462
i mean, we all know it's a thousand-page bill. %$* 462
let me tell you-- %$* 462
no, no, it's not a thousand page bill. %$* 18
it's $2800. 2800 pages. %$* 18
okay. %$* 462
well, the type's very big. %$* 462
that's how they do congressional-- %$* 462
there you go. %$* 18
okay. %$* 462
whatever. %$* 462
you know, i think if you condense it-- %$* 462
true story, if you condense it, it actually comes down to about 300 pages, which you know, is less than a john grisham book so take that into account. %$* 462
but not nearly as good, right? %$* 13
not nearly as good. %$* 13
i'm actually not a john grisham fan. %$* 462
but your mileage may vary. %$* 462
but i mean there are-- %$* 462
and you yourself admitted the delivery reforms in there-- %$* 462
you think they're not big enough, okay? %$* 462
and you know what? %$* 462
i would agree with you. %$* 462
i would like those delivery reforms to be stronger. %$* 462
so here is a proposition. %$* 462
you're talking about repealing obamacare. %$* 462
yes. %$* 18
how about let's reinforce it. %$* 462
let's make those bigger. %$* 462
why do you want to go back and start from scratch? %$* 462
john shadegg. %$* 13
i have to raise an issue which your side has raised, and that is you say it gives people choices. %$* 459
it takes a lot of gall to say that it gives people choices. %$* 459
for example, in medicare advantage, it repeals medicare advantage for millions of americans and takes them off. %$* 459
it reduces subsidies that are %$* 460
no, no. %$* 459
it takes-- %$* 459
it will drive people off of medicare advantage. %$* 459
every expert agrees on that. %$* 459
two, you say that people will have choice of plans. %$* 459
there is one plan prescribed by the government, actually has three different components, but that's it. %$* 459
three. %$* 459
secretary sebelius can grant exemptions. %$* 459
she already has too many companies. %$* 459
she has the ability to impose new benefit mandates. %$* 459
she has ability to say what premium increase is effective or not effective. %$* 459
the notion that this bill gives the average american more choice is ridiculous. %$* 459
it's going to take away the choices americans have now, and it's going to force them into essentially a one-size-fits-all plan. %$* 459
when you say, for example, to employers, that your costs are going to up, such as at&t, to the tune where you could pay the fine for not insuring every one of your employees and still save $2 billion, they're going to have no choice but to drop their coverage and put people into the government- run plan. %$* 459
can i just respond to this because this is the second time that you've mentioned this. %$* 460
let me finish. %$* 459
let me finish. %$* 459
let him finish, paul, because i do want to hear the response to this. %$* 13
john shadegg. %$* 13
if at&t or any of these other companies wanted to drop coverage now-- %$* 460
hold on just one minute. %$* 13
and you get 15 more seconds to finish your point. %$* 13
sit this thing down. %$* 13
no, he can go. %$* 459
that's fine. %$* 459
oh, i give you 15 seconds, and you throw it away. %$* 13
i mean-- %$* 459
okay. %$* 13
paul. %$* 13
under current law, if any of those companies wanted to drop coverage, they could do it legally. %$* 460
this law introduces a penalty for dropping coverage. %$* 460
so how can you say that the law encourages them to-- %$* 460
precisely because right now they choose to provide that coverage for their employees because that competitive market requires them to do that. %$* 459
people want good coverage. %$* 459
if they drop that coverage, there's no place for those employees to go. %$* 459
under this bill, they will all get government subsidies. %$* 459
and oh, by the way, at&t can take that $2 billion savings and add it to people's salaries. %$* 459
so the notion that this is going to give you more choice, when, for example, we don't allow interstate competition in health insurance now. %$* 459
your employer makes the choice of your plan. %$* 459
you can't hire-- %$* 459
okay. %$* 13
you can't fire. %$* 459
jonathan-- %$* 13
jonathan-- %$* 13
i want you to have-- %$* 13
it's actually quite cogently put. %$* 13
and you know, it makes sense. %$* 462
and then, gosh, why would at&t keep providing coverage? %$* 462
if you're right, and i know doug has written a paper on this also, if you guys are right, that in offering all of these subsidies companies are going to drop, then we should see that in massachusetts right now because that's what they have in massachusetts. %$* 462
they offer the subsidies, and companies-- %$* 462
but you know what? %$* 462
it hasn't happened. %$* 462
employer-sponsored insurance in massachusetts-- %$* 462
no, no, no, no. %$* 462
let me. %$* 462
it hasn't happened. %$* 462
and the best estimates from the experts are that it won't happen. %$* 462
and there's a very complicated-- %$* 462
i mean, i could go through all the math-- %$* 462
i read doug's paper on this, and i know it seems like it makes sense, but it doesn't happen. %$* 462
would it happen right now with medicaid? %$* 462
and you know, you don't see company-- %$* 462
half the people who qualify for medicaid %$* 462
let's let your massachusetts respond to that. %$* 13
actually, number one, in massachusetts, we're down to, i think, to only four carriers. %$* 459
several of them are in dire straits. %$* 459
many of them have demanded from the governor that he allow them to raise rates. %$* 459
the governor has said no. %$* 459
and some of them-- %$* 459
are on the verge of folding. %$* 459
now, let me ask you something. %$* 459
the plan, under obamacare, says that if you're in an exchange, a government-run exchange, and you only offer the policy that the government exchange allows, then you can get a subsidy. %$* 459
every republican plan says let's give every single american a tax refund, a tax credit to go buy the plan of their choice. %$* 459
now, i guarantee you, if we do that, so we say to every american, you get a refundable tax credit, a refund, and for the poor, it's cash, to go buy the plan of your choice. %$* 459
and you can buy your employer's plan. %$* 459
you can buy in the individual market. %$* 459
you can join a new group sponsored by the kiwanis club. %$* 459
you can join a new group sponsored by-- %$* 459
would you mandate a purchase? %$* 13
would you mandate it? %$* 13
no, i would not mandate it because i think freedom is a hallmark of this country. %$* 459
and i think if we offer great-- %$* 459
so maybe a lot of that money would end up at the amusement park or the race track? %$* 13
well, let me tell you how my plan works. %$* 459
it offers every single american, every single american that refundable tax credit if they don't make enough money if they do not enroll because they are homeless and don't get the notice we automatically enroll them because we know their social security number and we knew it as one point, they show up for care somewhere, and they say, "what plan did you enroll in? %$* 459
" and the individual says-- %$* 459
she's a mother of three that was moving from idaho to arizona on the day that the notice came to her, she says, "i didn't enroll." they look her up on a social security number and they say, "oh, yeah, you're in the pool." %$* 459
okay. %$* 13
"and you're covered." that's the way paul ryan's bill works, that's the way tom coburn's-- %$* 459
okay, john, you've made that point. %$* 13
i want to stay on the merits of the obama plan. %$* 13
do you want to respond to that, either of you, gentlemen? %$* 13
i want to respond to this whole notion that it's a complete individual free market here, to talk a little bit about the way insurance works. %$* 460
healthcare is very different from other kinds of services and commodities. %$* 460
seventy percent of the healthcare costs in any year are concentrated in 10 percent of the people. %$* 460
so insurance companies have a very strong incentive to cherry pick, to go out and to look for the 50 percent of people who actually account for only three percent of the costs. %$* 460
and when you have this market where supposedly everybody has individual choices, you also have a market where the insurance companies are going to cherry pick and avoid the sick people. %$* 460
they will do everything in their-- %$* 460
it is the best business model for them. %$* 460
rather than try to control healthcare costs, it's just to avoid sick people. %$* 460
the way the exchanges work is that if you want to sell insurance in the exchange, you have to agree to take anybody. %$* 460
that’s the bargain. %$* 460
and what the exchange does, so the people pay in on a community rated basis, but the insurance companies get paid according to the risk of the population they enroll. %$* 460
so if they enroll an older population, if they enroll a sicker population, they get paid more. %$* 460
that’s what goes on through the exchange that won’t go on through this market. %$* 460
i realize this is complicated. %$* 460
insurance is a complicated business, and this law is trying to take account of the way this business characteristically malfunctions. %$* 460
that’s why we end up with millions of people uninsured. %$* 460
okay, i’m going to come to questions and-- %$* 13
i’m going to come to questions from you in just a minute. %$* 13
i want to give this side one 35- second shot at %$* 13
so john shadegg is taking %$* 13
this criticism is often made, and the democrat answer, the obamacare answer is to say, “okay, we’re going to do guaranteed issue, everybody gets insurance even if you're already sick." the incentive of that is not to buy insurance until it’s too late or until the costs have gone up. %$* 459
i’d like to ask paul, “how is it the insurance companies know who’s going to get sick before the people know, and how is it that they can cherry pick the healthy? %$* 459
” but let me tell you how republicans solve this problem. %$* 459
let me tell you how republicans would solve this problem, i know because i happen to have written it, what you do is you say to everyone that has a preexisting condition or has a chronic illness, "you have the right, the absolute right to join what’s called a high risk pool. %$* 459
you may enroll in that plan if you are either denied coverage altogether or if your coverage is priced at, we’ll say, 20 percent, or 30 percent, or more above the average cost, because you have a preexisting condition. %$* 459
once you enroll in the high risk pool, your health is covered comprehensively including my sister's breast cancer or my heart condition, and the-- %$* 459
so that means that the cost of insuring that pool is higher than the cost of insuring any other pool. %$* 459
that’s a high risk pool. %$* 459
the costs of insuring that group are then subsidized either by dividing it equally, the extra costs amongst every insurance company in the jurisdiction, it could be the state or it could be federal, or by general revenues from the state, often done by sin taxes. %$* 459
i happen to know that because it’s already the law in 22 different states. %$* 459
all right. %$* 13
i happen to know it because i wrote the last federal law that allows it. %$* 459
john, john, let me move on to some questions from the audience. %$* 13
and if you-- %$* 13
what i’d like to ask you to do, i’ll call on you, wait till a microphone reaches you, and then hold the microphone about one fist's distance from your mouth so that the television and radio can hear you very clearly. %$* 13
and there’s a gentleman in a black sweater. %$* 13
hey, sir, before you begin, i just want to ask you something, what have you heard so far that you thought, "well, i hadn’t thought of that before"? %$* 13
hmm. %$* 18
that's a tough question. %$* 18
i thought i was asking the question. %$* 18
guess we haven't-- %$* 13
your turn will come. %$* 13
and i’ll give you a pass if you don’t have a ready answer to that. %$* 13
and i'm not meaning to put you on the spot, i’m actually quite curious to know how it’s being received out there. %$* 13
so if you have no thoughts on that, we will pretend that question didn’t come up. %$* 13
my only thought is, next time i will not be the first questioner. %$* 18
go ahead. %$* 13
my question is for the gentleman on this side. %$* 18
recently my house burned down and i tried to buy fire insurance after the fact and the insurance company said it was a pre- existing fire. %$* 18
now, that doesn’t sound fair to me. %$* 18
does it sound fair to you? %$* 18
no, no it’s not. %$* 460
that is why-- %$* 460
so i should be able to buy fire insurance after my house burns down. %$* 18
no, no absolutely not. %$* 460
look, one of the reasons that there is a mandate in this law is precisely to avoid the possibility that people will refuse to buy insurance until they get sick. %$* 460
that’s the whole rationale for the mandate. %$* 460
now i’ve actually proposed another way to accomplish the same purpose because the mandate is the single most unpopular part of the bill. %$* 460
people don’t understand that the mandate is directly related to the elimination of pre-existing condition exclusion. %$* 460
you can’t eliminate those exclusions just for the reasons you said unless you have some way to get the people into the pool. %$* 460
my alternative is the following. %$* 460
if you want to opt out, if you don’t want to be part of the system, okay, you can do that without penalty. %$* 460
but you have to sign a form saying “i won’t come back and i cannot come back in. %$* 460
for five years, i can’t use the exchanges, i can’t get the subsidies, i can’t get a policy without the pre-existing conditions.” so i understand your position completely. %$* 460
we need to be able to avoid the possibility that people will behave opportunistically. %$* 460
so paul, you don’t want to repeal but you do want to tinker. %$* 13
oh, i am willing to make changes. %$* 460
tinkering’s fine. %$* 462
we’re not against it. %$* 462
everybody who understands this plan thinks it’s not a perfect bill. %$* 462
no bill is perfect. %$* 462
the question is is it a good foundation. %$* 462
let me do a very quick thing for radio. %$* 13
this is a u.s. debate-- %$* 13
this is a great debate. %$* 13
i just wanted to say that. %$* 13
i’m john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
this is a debate from intelligence squared u.s.we are at the skirball center for the performing arts at new york university, new york and hundreds of npr stations across the nation. %$* 13
our motion is “repeal obamacare” and we are taking questions from the audience. %$* 13
how was that? %$* 13
not bad. %$* 13
very good. %$* 18
woman with your hand up right there. %$* 13
yep. %$* 13
i’m going to ask you the same question and if you’re not prepared to answer that’s fine, i just want to-- %$* 13
what are you hearing that has caught your ear? %$* 13
what i’m hearing is that the republicans have a plan. %$* 19
i’ve never heard of any republican plan in all the years that republicans were in control. %$* 19
okay, your question. %$* 13
maybe that was it. %$* 13
that was it. %$* 18
oh, that was a comment. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
well, there you go. %$* 13
on the side, gentleman, yes, right there. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
if you could stand. %$* 13
also if you happen to be a member of the news media, we would appreciate it if you could identify yourself as such. %$* 13
i’m from the state of massachusetts, actually. %$* 18
my question is not about that. %$* 18
i’m the son of a surgeon and i’m wondering if the bill does anything to address the so-called doctor fix with regards to medicare pay outs to doctors? %$* 18
that comes up in congress pretty frequently. %$* 18
i was wondering-- %$* 18
fourteen seconds on what that means for people who don’t know what that is. %$* 13
to my knowledge, i’m not an expert on it. %$* 18
i just hear my father rant and rave about it. %$* 18
the-- %$* 18
i believe it was in the cost bills back in the ‘90s to try to reform medicare, they had a formula to try to pay doctors at some rate pegged to inflation and it doesn’t work. %$* 18
i’m not an expert on it myself. %$* 18
but i know it comes up in congress quite frequently. %$* 18
it causes a stir. %$* 18
i think it somehow drives pay outs to doctors who see medicare patients. %$* 18
down 40 or 50 percent every six months. %$* 18
i know it comes up in congress pretty frequently. %$* 18
i-- %$* 18
okay. %$* 13
if you don’t mind, i’m going to pass on the question unless it’s quite relevant. %$* 13
on this broken formula that reimburses doctors under medicare, part of the bba that jonathan lauded which in the end failed miserably. %$* 461
the bottom line is it’s not part of the bill because they left it out. %$* 461
it’s part of the cost they don’t want to acknowledge. %$* 461
if you want to know why this doesn’t reduce the deficit, they left out $300 billion worth of costs. %$* 461
and the cbo doesn’t have the option of saying hey, you left that out. %$* 461
they have the obligation to price only what is in there. %$* 461
jonathan cohn. %$* 13
and they are precluded by law from raising their hand and saying but you left out the doctors. %$* 461
jonathan cohn. %$* 13
i ran the cbo. %$* 461
here’s something else. %$* 462
you look at the cbo report on the affordable care act and you’ll discover something shocking. %$* 462
it doesn’t account for the cost of the war in afghanistan. %$* 462
now that’s because the war in afghanistan is a separate piece of legislation. %$* 462
during the late 1990’s, as part of a much larger balanced budget bill that i recall quite correctly working and getting us balanced budgets for a while-- %$* 462
you’ve given back all those savings. %$* 461
you’ve given them all back. %$* 461
they don’t work. %$* 461
before tax cut, i remember, i was against it. %$* 462
has nothing to do with tax cuts. %$* 461
nothing to do with tax cuts? %$* 462
nothing to do with tax cuts? %$* 462
really. %$* 462
the bba health provisions have-- %$* 461
wait, wait, wait. %$* 462
you're really saying the bush tax cuts have nothing to do with the deficits? %$* 462
no. %$* 461
it has nothing to do with healthcare. %$* 461
i agree. %$* 462
so this is-- %$* 461
you're making my point. %$* 462
this is a debate about healthcare. %$* 461
and the fact of the matter is the balanced budget agreement healthcare provisions passed in the late '90s failed. %$* 461
they did not control costs. %$* 461
and in the end, the congress had to give the money back, as they will have to give it to the physicians under medicare. %$* 461
that-- %$* 461
jonathan, 20 seconds. %$* 13
did not work. %$* 18
okay. %$* 462
you're hearing a very interesting version of the history of the '90s and healthcare. %$* 462
the doctor fix was built into our budgets for the government long before healthcare reform came on the scene. %$* 462
it is something that needs to be fixed separately. %$* 462
it would have to be fixed separately if we never had obamacare. %$* 462
it is a separate cost. %$* 462
who can tell me in 15 seconds what it is, because i don't know. %$* 13
it is literally this. %$* 18
it was a formula for reimbursements for doctors. %$* 18
doctors are very expensive. %$* 18
and so they keep pretending they're not going to fulfill the formula. %$* 18
and then doctors face a big pay cut. %$* 18
and then congress says, “well, i guess we do have to pay doctors. %$* 18
doctors are part of healthcare.” %$* 18
they are part of healthcare. %$* 462
part of healthcare reform. %$* 461
so your dad is afraid he's going to be paid less, but he isn't-- %$* 13
twenty five percent less next year unless they, once again, put the money back in. %$* 461
another question, please. %$* 13
from the far side with the gray hair. %$* 13
i found it interesting that the panel is assuming that healthcare runs on a perfect market economy, which is fundamentally flawed. %$* 18
i wanted to know about, you keep addressing costs. %$* 18
and i think that this debate is mostly about access to care and not really about costs. %$* 18
do either of you have an answer to utilization and patient and physician-induced demand, which is really the cost-- %$* 18
so is the bill designed to get people insured, or is it designed to keep the costs down primarily? %$* 13
paul starr. %$* 13
but nobody's addressed cost, which is utilization. %$* 18
well, it's both of those things. %$* 460
but the questioner used a phrase which probably went by a lot of people. %$* 460
he talked about physician-induced demand or provider-induced demand. %$* 460
so this is another aspect of how healthcare is different. %$* 460
normally, when you are the customer, you make decisions about what to buy. %$* 460
but when you're a patient, particularly when you're very sick, you're in the hospital, other people are making decisions. %$* 460
they're prescribing drugs, procedures and so forth. %$* 460
and if you're really sick, and most of the big costs are generated for people who are very ill, it's not-- %$* 460
the demand isn't coming from you. %$* 460
it's coming from the supplier. %$* 460
this is a very bizarre system. %$* 460
a very interesting point. %$* 13
i want to hear-- %$* 13
and that's one of paul starr's basic arguments for why this is not like other things that you pay money for. %$* 13
can you respond to that, john-- %$* 13
douglas holtz-eakin. %$* 13
couple responses. %$* 461
number one, there are no perfect markets. %$* 461
and to somehow compare health markets against perfection misses the point. %$* 461
all markets are, at some level, imperfect and have anomalies of the same type. %$* 461
the solution to this is to better inform-- %$* 461
hang on. %$* 461
let me finish. %$* 461
let me finish. %$* 461
the important thing here is to have reforms which republicans include as well as the-- %$* 461
your arguments, to better inform patients so they can distinguish between valuable and invaluable treatments. %$* 461
and we have a system riddled with low-value care. %$* 461
and all of the reforms republicans propose address that issue. %$* 461
an important thing to recognize, the reason i'm deeply opposed to this bill is, it is fundamentally-- %$* 461
there are pages attached to all the issues. %$* 461
but it is fundamentally a coverage bill. %$* 461
and if you look at half the expansions, they are in medicaid. %$* 461
sixteen million americans we've put into medicaid. %$* 461
medicaid's a terrible system. %$* 461
fifty percent of providers will not see medicaid patients. %$* 461
medicaid patients are twice as likely to show up at the er for regular medical care than are the uninsured. %$* 461
and it is a great joke to give someone an insurance policy called medicaid and not let them actually see a physician. %$* 461
john shadegg, you want to add to that briefly? %$* 13
i do. %$* 459
to what your partner said. %$* 13

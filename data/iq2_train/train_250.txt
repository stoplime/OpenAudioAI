andrew, did you-- %$* 13
you need to respond? %$* 13
i just wanted to say-- %$* 653
andrew krepinevich. %$* 13
again, this is putting the cart before the horse. %$* 653
to say, “oh, let's cut a trillion dollars out of defense and all of a sudden, everything's going to be efficient, and we're going to stop all this pork barreling”-- %$* 653
i mean, again, that is the triumph of hope over experience. %$* 653
and the next question-- %$* 13
we haven't heard much from kori or tom for the last five minutes. %$* 13
so i'd like to hear those voices. %$* 13
so, with the ipad. %$* 13
make it a great question. %$* 13
and could you stand, please? %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
thank you for this wonderful debate. %$* 661
by i'm from south korea. %$* 661
my name is jaeduk cho and i'm-- %$* 661
yeah, i'm a student there. %$* 661
and i want to clearly state that my opinion has nothing to do with my government's opinion. %$* 661
so my question-- %$* 661
and with these people. %$* 13
so i do believe that the united states has ridden to the top of the world because it was economically stronger than any other nations at that point, at that time. %$* 661
but now, remaining militarily strong but remaining economically weak, how can it be-- %$* 661
how can it-- %$* 661
how can it maintain its position of the leader of the world? %$* 661
because i do believe that great britain has gone down in flames because it has spent too much. %$* 661
and it's as the name of england. %$* 661
so-- %$* 661
can i rephrase you slightly? %$* 13
right. %$* 662
and maybe-- %$* 13
sure. %$* 662
this is not your point, but i think you're saying that-- %$* 13
you're saying that a strong american military is not enough, on its own, to ensure america's security. %$* 13
is that what you're saying? %$* 13
no. %$* 662
i mean, being economically strong is more important than being militarily strong. %$* 662
that is my point. %$* 662
i know this side has already argued that point. %$* 13
and i'm not sure this side disagrees with that. %$* 13
tom donnelly. %$* 13
i don't think we-- %$* 652
no, we don't disagree with it. %$* 652
again, we have to keep things in perspective, as-- %$* 652
although i would add to that, we're not suffering from what, you know, the historian paul kennedy called imperial overstretch. %$* 652
we're suffering from things like entitlement overstretch. %$* 652
the money that we're spending that's impoverishing us is not going, for the most part, to buy military power. %$* 652
it's going to buy other things that the government does, like provide social services. %$* 652
whether that's a good thing or bad thing or not, i-- %$* 652
you know, people can reasonably disagree. %$* 652
but that's where the money is going. %$* 652
and if we want to reform both the federal government's books and to boost economic productivity, we can't do it by cutting the defense budget. %$* 652
we have to do it in other ways. %$* 652
yeah, i would say-- %$* 653
just let me add something to what tom said. %$* 653
the problem isn't necessarily entitlements, per se. %$* 653
it's the fact that as a people we're not willing to pay for the benefits we vote ourselves. %$* 653
entitlements are up around 10 percent of gdp, not 3 percent. %$* 653
and they-- %$* 653
the slope line is going up dramatically. %$* 653
and as robert rubin said not too long ago, if we don't get a handle, particularly on the medical entitlements, then there's no way we can solve our economic problem. %$* 653
ma'am. %$* 13
red sweater. %$* 13
this might be the last question, so make it a killer. %$* 13
my name is michelle dikeman my question is really that the argument against has always been predicated on that we have this huge gap in our technical capabilities over our enemies. %$* 663
but yet i've seen how china and russia are stealing our intellectual property and using that to make huge advances in their capabilities. %$* 663
so how can you argue that by cutting the defense budget that we're simply going to be able to maintain our dominance when our enemies are using our technology and our technical development against us? %$* 663
boy, that was a well-framed question. %$* 13
kori schake. %$* 13
because i don't think our spending is the metric by which you should judge our innovation, our capacity to adapt to things. %$* 655
you're exactly right, the protection of intellectual property is actually probably the most important thing the american government should be negotiating in our trade treaties, because that is the engine of our economy. %$* 655
i live in silicon valley, and you can just feel the way that excitement and interaction and people spurring off each other’s ideas. %$* 655
we build better mouse traps. %$* 655
and so i guess i am less concerned than you are because i'm pretty highly confident that we will continue to be an engine of innovation, of new ideas, and that having them steal the design for the original ipod is a dangerous thing, but it's a lot less dangerous when we go on to the ipod 7. %$* 655
and that concludes round 2 of this debate. %$* 13
i was late with my hand cue. %$* 13
i'm sorry. %$* 13
here's where we are. %$* 13
were about to hear brief closing statements from each debater in turn. %$* 13
these closing statements will be two minutes each. %$* 13
remember, you voted before the debate. %$* 13
we're going to have you vote again immediately afterwards. %$* 13
and the team that has moved its numbers the most in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. %$* 13
onto round 3, closing statements. %$* 13
our motion is, “cutting the pentagon's budget is a gift to our enemies.” here to summarize-- %$* 13
we do all of-- %$* 13
the closing statements will all be seated, kori, thanks. %$* 13
here to summarize her position against this motion, kori schake, a research fellow at the hoover institute. %$* 13
so spending is an input measure. %$* 655
it's one thing you do to create an outcome that you want. %$* 655
and to argue that constraining one element of why the united states is so dominant and so powerful and such a force for good in the world, that constraining that one element will in fact be a gift to our enemies dramatically understates all the other things that go into america being a dominant power, the innovation that you talked about, the economic strengths that you talked about, the value of our ideas, the extent to which who we are and what we are willing to fight for in the world reshapes other people's sense of the possibilities and their future. %$* 655
there are a lot of reasons the united states is powerful and admired and feared in the world. %$* 655
and defense spending, a small cut on the margin of that, is actually not going to have a major perturbation of effect on it. %$* 655
but in fact, spending is much too crude a measure by which to determine whether or not it-- %$* 655
that the united states is giving gifts to our enemies. %$* 655
it's too small a factor in the overall-- %$* 655
in the overall constellation of who the united states is and why it's powerful and dominant in the international order. %$* 655
and that in order to accept our opponents' proposition, you would have to believe that a small change at the margin of a very large defense budget of a very good military would, in fact, have a major influence on the calculations of america's enemies in the world. %$* 655
and ben and i are trying to argue there's a more complicated calculation than that. %$* 655
more things go into it, and that we need to think in a broader term. %$* 655
and you can accept many of the very good arguments that andy and tom made-- %$* 655
kori schake, i'm sorry. %$* 13
your time is up. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
and still vote for our measure! %$* 655
the motion is cutting the pentagon's budget is a gift to our enemies. %$* 13
and here to summarize his position in support of this motion, thomas donnelly. %$* 13
he's co-director of the marilyn ware center for security studies at the american enterprise institute. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, thomas donnelly. %$* 13
well, thanks to you all for listening to this sometimes unhappy and complex debate. %$* 652
i still think that the basic proposition is pretty simple and straightforward. %$* 652
and i guess that's why i'm not a political scientist and i'm more of a historian because that's the experience that-- %$* 652
and the measures, the outputs by which i would judge this proposition. %$* 652
kori keeps talking about americans building a better mouse trap. %$* 652
the world that we have built over the last seven decades is a really good mouse trap. %$* 652
it's a complex mouse trap, as kori suggested. %$* 652
there are lots of things that go into making a liberal peace. %$* 652
but it's not a liberal peace that invented itself. %$* 652
the europeans didn't, after five centuries of slaughtering one another and slaughtering the rest of the peoples in the world, decide-- %$* 652
get all together and say, you know, i think we should cut this out. %$* 652
not even the imperial japanese. %$* 652
they were defeated in war by the united states, and because of that, they've become liberal democracies and pretty peaceful ones too. %$* 652
so i don't know what the marginal difference will be, but it's not an experiment that i want to make. %$* 652
we've seen what's happened with the marginal cuts of the last couple of years. %$* 652
we see what's happening in syria today. %$* 652
we see the chinese messing about in the south china sea. %$* 652
are they coming to our shores tomorrow? %$* 652
no. %$* 652
but let's not let it come to that point. %$* 652
a marginal difference. %$* 652
we don't want to know where the last margin of safety is. %$* 652
it's better to have more margins of safety than less. %$* 652
and that's really what this proposition comes down to. %$* 652
thank you, thomas donnelly. %$* 13
our motion is, “cutting the pentagon's budget is a gift to our enemies.” and here to support-- %$* 13
here to summarize his argument against this motion, benjamin friedman, a research fellow at the cato institute. %$* 13
for the record, i'm for world war ii.i think that was a good move for us to fight that. %$* 654
so let's not say that we oppose that. %$* 654
look, my argument is-- %$* 654
it has two parts. %$* 654
number one, we can do a lot-- %$* 654
we can save a lot of money while doing all the things we do in the world. %$* 654
if you think we're agents of history and everything in the world is great because of us, fine. %$* 654
go listen to some of the recommendations out there on how to cut the defense budget by 50 or 60 billion, and you can do it, okay? %$* 654
you can cut the defense budget and still have these alliances. %$* 654
my own view is these alliances and a lot of stuff we're doing in the world are actually bad for our security, so we'd be even better off if we could get out of the business of trying to run everyone else's security for them. %$* 654
pax britannica, pax americana, a lot of other things were happening in the world at that time. %$* 654
a lot has changed. %$* 654
there were-- %$* 654
it's a disservice to history to say that there's only one factor that matters, which is whether or not there's a hegemon that's trying to manage international affairs. %$* 654
there's a variety of reasons, changes in the international system that encourage peace, absent the benevolence of the united states of america. %$* 654
so i think what we have today is a luxury budget. %$* 654
it's not a defense budget. %$* 654
it protects our safety in the same way a billionaire's restaurant choices prevent his starvation. %$* 654
there's a lot of room-- %$* 654
there's a lot of room in there for us to be safe and cut. %$* 654
so i think cuts to the pentagon are a gift to ourselves, will make us a bit richer. %$* 654
and in the long term by inducing some choices that we've avoided in the defense budget, they might make us reconsider some policies that actually erode our security and get us into trouble. %$* 654
and that's why cutting the defense budget is not a gift to our enemies. %$* 654
thank you. %$* 13
benjamin friedman. %$* 13
our motion is, “cutting the pentagon's budget is a gift to our enemies.” and here to summarize his position in support of this motion, andrew krepinevich, president of the center for strategic and budgetary assessments. %$* 13
one way to think about your vote is if vladimir putin were here tonight or the senior generals of the pla or the ayatollah khomeini, how would they be voting, do you think? %$* 653
the issue we debate here tonight is very real for me. %$* 653
for 25 years i wore the uniform of a soldier, and in the 1973 middle east war we were one order short of arming nuclear warheads. %$* 653
but we were trained. %$* 653
we were equipped. %$* 653
we were ready. %$* 653
two years later in 1975 i was stationed on a militarized zone in korea when the north koreans were digging tunnels underneath us and trying to intercept the resupply ships we were sending out to some of the islands off the coast of south korea. %$* 653
but we had confidence in our equipment. %$* 653
we had well-trained troops. %$* 653
we weren't looking forward to a scrape but we were ready. %$* 653
only two years later, after the results of watergate and vietnam and inflation and oil shocks really hit home, i was in a unit where we couldn't train, where our troops were hiding toilet paper because we couldn't get toilet paper for our troops, where some of my best soldiers were leaving the army because they had no faith that the american people were willing to provide what was necessary for us to be a ready unit. %$* 653
and i say thankfully we were not put to the test. %$* 653
we recovered, but it was a very expensive proposition in the early 1980s to put humpty dumpty back together again after the military was broken. %$* 653
we were lucky. %$* 653
i wouldn't want to risk our security or our economic well-being on luck, and certainly not the lives of our young men and women in uniform. %$* 653
thank you. %$* 653
thank you. %$* 13
andrew krepinevich. %$* 13
and that concludes our closing statements, and now it's time to see which side you feel has argued the best. %$* 13
we want to have you go again to the keypad at your seat to register your vote. %$* 13
you voted before the debate, we're going to have you vote again now. %$* 13
and the team that has moved its numbers the most in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. %$* 13
press one if you are in support of the motion, two if you are against it, three if you are undecided. %$* 13
the motion is, "cutting the pentagon's budget is a gift to our enemies." it looks like everybody's ready. %$* 13
we're going to have the results-- %$* 13
i'm going to announce the results in about two minutes from now, but first, we regret that senator mccain has a day job, that he-- %$* 13
we don't regret it, actually we're glad he's doing his day job-- %$* 13
he is there doing it now. %$* 13
he wasn't able to make it, sends his regrets, but we want to bring back to the stage in his place ambassador kurt volker. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 117
so before we get the results of the voting, i just want to raise one question of my own. %$* 117
was this the best most illuminating discussion of our defense budget cuts that you have heard in this town in a long time? %$* 117
and also is john donvan the best moderator you've seen do this in-- %$* 117
now, when we got here there were a lot of the issues that were going to come out. %$* 117
the fact is we are cutting our defense budgets, and the fact is we're going to have to face a lot of choices about what that means and how we manage it. %$* 117
and i think you heard tonight a lot of the things that we're going to be thinking about in the months ahead as we have to work through that process. %$* 117
so i want to thank all of you again for coming this evening and i want to apologize on behalf of senator mccain that indeed he does have a day job. %$* 117
i was going to say, "unfortunately, he's stuck working on immigration,” but actually i think i feel fortunately he's working on immigration. %$* 117
so thank you all. %$* 117
thank you, kurt volcker. %$* 13
and just a couple of announcements. %$* 13
we'd love it if you tweeted about this debate. %$* 13
our twitter handle is @iq2us, @mccaininstitute, and #pentagon. %$* 13
thank you again to the mccain institute team. %$* 13
we really, really enjoyed partnering with you on this. %$* 13
it was-- %$* 13
it's been a terrific partnership, and i think we both gained out of it. %$* 13
i also want to thank wamu which carries almost all of our debates and was very involved in letting a lot of you know about this debate and obviously they got through to you because the place is full and we're delighted by that. %$* 13
this was our 75th debate since bob rosenkranz brought intelligence squared to the united states. %$* 13
and we are happy to be sharing this milestone with everybody here. %$* 13
our fall season in new york starts in september. %$* 13
some of the topics that we're going to be looking at include drones, breaking up the big banks, the case for going vegan-- %$* 13
that's not a washington topic. %$* 13
gun-- %$* 13
gun control and immigration. %$* 13
our tickets go on sale later on this summer. %$* 13
for more information and to purchase tickets, visit our website at www.iq2us.org, and don't forget to visit the mccain institute for international leadership's website, and that is at mccaininstitute.org, for all of their upcoming events. %$* 13
they have a full schedule constantly, things happening here in washington dc.we wanted to encourage you to take a look at the encyclopedia and look at dwight eisenhower, circa 1939.we actually pulled the photograph. %$* 13
we've looked at it. %$* 13
but i don't want to put it up on the screen without your permission. %$* 13
go ahead? %$* 13
we have your permission? %$* 13
switched at birth or what? %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
thank you for being a good sport. %$* 13
that was great. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
we've had-- %$* 13
i now have the final results. %$* 13
you have voted twice, once before the debate, and once again afterwards, after hearing all of the arguments. %$* 13
here is the result. %$* 13
the motion: cutting the pentagon's budget is a gift to our enemies. %$* 13
before the debate, in polling the live audience, 22 percent of you agreed with the motion, 57 percent were against, and 21 percent were undecided. %$* 13
those are the first results. %$* 13
remember now, the team-- %$* 13
after you vote the second time, the team that has changed the most numbers in percentage point terms is declared our winner. %$* 13
onto the second vote. %$* 13
cutting the pentagon's budget is a gift to our enemies. %$* 13
the team arguing for the motion in the second vote went from 22 percent to 29 percent. %$* 13
they picked up seven percentage points. %$* 13
that is the number to beat: seven percentage points. %$* 13
now, the team against the motion in first vote was 57 percent. %$* 13
the second vote, 65 percent. %$* 13
that is eight percentage points. %$* 13
it's enough to win, just barely. %$* 13
the team arguing against the motion that cutting the pentagon's budget is a gift to our enemies has been declared our winner. %$* 13
congratulations to them. %$* 13
and thank you from me, john donvan. %$* 13
we'll see you next time. %$* 13

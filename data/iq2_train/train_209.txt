we don't want to live on the campus. %$* 547
they want to live in the city. %$* 547
open up an office in san francisco. %$* 547
open up offices in new york city. %$* 547
like, all right free food, that's great, but don't think you can re-create the world at huge cost and make it better than reality. %$* 547
so i think that's highly illustrative. %$* 547
i think that the more universities open, the more the university embraces the resources of the world and is open to students, whether they are their students or not, the more vibrant the physical elements of the university would become, like the research infrastructure, and the less university will start to compete-- %$* 547
or will continue to compete in an area like who has the better climbing gym. %$* 547
okay, we will take some other questions. %$* 13
i'm favoring the front because i can see it more easily, so i just want to ma'am, all the way in the back there. %$* 13
and again, if you could stand up. %$* 13
my name is jessica. %$* 19
jessica, i've just been asked in my headphone to ask you to step down into the brighter light so that the television camera can see you for the live stream. %$* 13
and, by the way, i didn't mention this in the beginning, but we've been live-streaming. %$* 13
we also do with tv and on our website, iq2us.org. %$* 13
so that's why you need to walk towards the light. %$* 13
can you see me now? %$* 19
yep. %$* 13
yep. %$* 13
i'm wondering how students are better prepared after receiving their degree. %$* 19
i asked for really short questions, but you got me. %$* 13
just a little more context. %$* 13
assuming that students online and offline complete their degree, how are they better prepared for the world? %$* 19
if they're-- %$* 13
how do the online versus the old model students-- %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
so to rephrase if i'm correct, you want to know whether students who graduate with a largely offline diploma-- %$* 13
or largely offline as good-- %$* 13
their education is as high quality as those who graduate from the old model, is that correct? %$* 13
or are you asking how are they getting jobs? %$* 13
exactly. %$* 19
not comparing the quality of the education, but how are they prepared-- %$* 19
for the real world. %$* 13
to enter the world. %$* 19
okay. %$* 13
let's put that question first to the side that has more experience with that. %$* 13
i would think anant and ben nelson, that's you. %$* 13
so again, i think online learning as we know it-- %$* 546
i really called it online learning 2.0, because the old style online learning, it really gave online learning a bad name, and i think different today. %$* 546
online learning today is completely different and you should go check it out. %$* 546
we have online labs. %$* 546
we have discussion forums. %$* 546
the kind of things we can grade are simply %$* 546
that it's better now, but to her question how are %$* 13
so if you assume this kind of quality of online learning-- %$* 546
i think at the end of the day it really depends on the content. %$* 546
if a great teacher created the online content or if a great teacher taught the in-person campus course and if the learner took one of the other and had a great experience and a degree, i would say that it shouldn't matter which one they did. %$* 546
and do you think that's realistic that if two guys walk into job interviews-- %$* 13
walked in and one of them got a degree online and one got a degree at a campus, and we don't need to stipulate which one it was, that they're roughly equal in terms of the kinds of courses offered, but the employer is going to look at them equally? %$* 13
i don't think so. %$* 546
i think if someone had enough money to pay for a completely campus experience and the same quality education they would have better soft skills, but i think the debate is about fewer bricks, more clicks, is the emphasis. %$* 546
so i think that on campuses to bring a lot more online learning, the blend of the online with soft skills and so on can be substantially better than anything they have on campus today. %$* 546
would the other side like to respond? %$* 13
because the last two questions have gone to this side. %$* 13
if you don't want to i can move on. %$* 13
let's move on. %$* 13
give me a question that would be more focused toward this side? %$* 13
ma'am, right here. %$* 13
yes. %$* 19
i was just curious for this side if you felt like maybe if future faculty or future professors took more training or became somehow more involved in the online world or, you know, that kind of iteration, they could still be a more competitive valuable part of-- %$* 19
that's a great question. %$* 13
that's a great question. %$* 13
it's almost a challenge to you, rebecca schuman, to get with the program. %$* 13
with what funding. %$* 549
yeah, i mean, maybe. %$* 549
i tried to flip my class last semester as an experiment, and it didn't go that well. %$* 549
but i used pretty good content. %$* 549
it was just that the students didn't like it. %$* 549
and what i find from talking to my students is that they do prefer the face-to-face experience. %$* 549
that's just what they prefer. %$* 549
i-- %$* 549
you know, i don't know if i get really good at making podcasts or if i had some higher production values with my youtubes or something, maybe. %$* 549
but right now i just-- %$* 549
i don't think it has to do-- %$* 549
the mooc that i'm taking on edx is gorgeously produced, and the guys are experts, and it's still just kind of dabbling, like it's not a replacement for a class yet. %$* 549
jonathan cole, do you want to answer the question as well? %$* 13
well, i mean obviously-- %$* 548
it's a hypothetical and an interesting one. %$* 548
if more people had experience in producing these things, they might teach better courses. %$* 548
but we don't know. %$* 548
i mean, one of the problems that i have with this is that-- %$* 548
all of this-- %$* 548
is that it seems to me that there are many possibilities for technology and many ways in which technology can improve universities. %$* 548
but we don't know, for example, the answer to the question before, which is how do graduates of one form or another respond in terms of employment opportunities? %$* 548
we don't know very much about different learning styles. %$* 548
we have so little evidence that it seems to me what we're doing is we are essentially casting our fate to the wind and saying, look, this is a possibility, not necessarily a fact, because we don't have very much empirical evidence to demonstrate the case of our opponents. %$* 548
and that concludes round two of this intelligence squared u.s.debate where our motion is "more clicks, fewer bricks: the lecture hall is obsolete." and remember how you voted just before the argument began, right after these closing statements which will be two minutes each. %$* 13
you will be asked to vote a second time, and then our winner will be declared. %$* 13
so onto round three. %$* 13
round three, closing statements from each debater in turn, uninterrupted. %$* 13
the motion: more clicks, fewer bricks: the lecture hall is obsolete." and here to summarize his position in support of the motion, anant agarwal, ceo of edx and a professor at mit. %$* 13
well, i have to say, you know, there are some great statements from our colleagues. %$* 546
i would love to take a class from rebecca. %$* 546
but this is not about comparing the absolute best that you can get in a particular kind of course against the online learning of yesteryear. %$* 546
i think we need to look at where is the average going to be? %$* 546
where is the majority of the university, the classroom, the students going to be? %$* 546
and i think in rebecca's case, she was able to recite the names of 15 of her students. %$* 546
in my case, it would take me forever to recite the names of 155,000 students that got something out of that course. %$* 546
but i will tell you-- %$* 546
very quickly about three students. %$* 546
deward mukendi he came up from a family of 14 from the democratic republic of congo. %$* 546
he goes to the university of cape town to learn computer science. %$* 546
in his first year, his father passes away. %$* 546
he can't pay his tuition anymore, and so he goes off into the world, and he's been working for ten years. %$* 546
now that online learning is available, he is going back to study, and he's taking these moocs, and he's learning. %$* 546
and he's saying, "i'm going to get a better job because of the kind of learning that i'm doing." i can give you name after name, omobavay 15-year-old student from in india, took my course, did really well. %$* 546
he applied to mit, and he got into mit, now he's a sophomore at mit.and at mit, two out of three students today compared to virtually zero two years ago are now doing blended online learning. %$* 546
mit moved into this in a big way. %$* 546
they're blending the classroom with a lot of online technology. %$* 546
so 2800 out of 4500 students at mit are now using the edx platform on campus in a blended model. %$* 546
and this is just two years old. %$* 546
i think if we look at where the average is going to be, i think things are going to be very different going ahead. %$* 546
so i would like you to think about the average student in all the world in terms of where universities should be and given that, i really urge you to think about more clicks, fewer bricks in terms of increasing access and also improving the quality of education on our campuses. %$* 546
thank you, anant agarwal. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 546
our motion is, "more clicks, fewer bricks: the lecture hall is obsolete." and here to summarize his position against this motion, jonathan cole. %$* 13
he is the john mitchell mason professor at columbia university. %$* 13
those of you among the jury sitting out there, consider closely whether my worthy opponents here-- %$* 548
i think they've made very interesting cases-- %$* 548
are espousing what is in fact fact, what is fiction, or what is wishful thinking. %$* 548
let me conclude with three anecdotes. %$* 548
a while ago, i offered a course in law, science and society. %$* 548
it was designed to challenge the presuppositions and biases of the students. %$* 548
frankly, it was designed to be both challenging and unsettling. %$* 548
at the end of the semester, one of my very smart students said to me, "i loved this course, the debates we had and the people i met. %$* 548
but every time i left this class, i had a headache. %$* 548
not knowing quite what i believed in any longer." and i said, "sam, those headaches are a great thing. %$* 548
it shows that you were really thinking hard. %$* 548
and those debates and those doubts you had are an essential part of learning." no set of clicks will replace students' experience. %$* 548
then there are the extremely popular courses at stanford's d school, an institute for design innovation, where one of the assignments was to rethink how people eat ramen noodles or an assignment that led to a news reading app that was bought by linkedin" for $90 million. %$* 548
the students came from every field, sciences, engineering, social sciences, et cetera. %$* 548
the students were taught by david kelly, one of the school's founders. %$* 548
and they were invited to really think of developing empathy muscles. %$* 548
they were also taught to forego computer screens and spreadsheets and focus on people. %$* 548
at the d school, says kelly, we learn by doing. %$* 548
sounds a lot like john dugas's philosophy brought back to being. %$* 548
it's a huge success with students churning out dozens of innovative products and startups. %$* 548
jonathan cole, i'm sorry, your time is up. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
two minutes go by so fast. %$* 548
they do. %$* 13
our motion is "more clicks, fewer bricks: the lecture hall is obsolete." and here to summarize his position supporting this motion, ben nelson, founder, chairman and ceo of the minerva project. %$* 13
i wouldn't want to end this debate without getting into the facts that jonathan so desperately wanted us to get to. %$* 547
so i'll give you two facts. %$* 547
one fact is what we actually know, not about online education, but about off line education, not at the community college, not at a state university, but at our most illustrious universities. %$* 547
professor at harvard university, eric mazur who teaches physics wanted to know how much his students retained from his physics classes. %$* 547
so he surveyed them two years after the end of the course. %$* 547
you know what their retention rate was? %$* 547
10 percent. %$* 547
the question isn't as much whether or not online education is effective, is it can’t possibly be any worse than the existing model? %$* 547
in fact, even when you give students a choice, as was done with the very first mooc, one offered by sebastian thrune at stanford university. %$* 547
sebastian thrune is a celebrity. %$* 547
he is the reason why you go to courses. %$* 547
he invented the self-driving car. %$* 547
neat guy. %$* 547
and he had a course of 200 students in artificial intelligence, and he gave them an option: schmooze with me in the lecture hall or go on version 0.1 of this terrible product and take the course online. %$* 547
of the 200 students, 85 percent never came back to the lecture hall. %$* 547
85 percent decided to take the online course in the very first most rudimentary version of online education. %$* 547
you don't need much more data than that to realize that the future of universities won't be without bricks, won't be all clicks, but will certainly be far more clicks than bricks. %$* 547
thank you. %$* 547
thank you, ben nelson. %$* 13
and that is our motion: more clicks, fewer bricks: the lecture hall is obsolete." and here to summarize her position against this motion, rebecca schuman. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 549
i just want to go on the record that anant thinks i am the best at teaching. %$* 549
i'm going to put that in all of my review portfolios. %$* 549
so i want to talk a little bit about my class again, not naming them, but i'm talking about what we did this week. %$* 549
so i don't lecture. %$* 549
my room is a seminar room not a lecture hall. %$* 549
and this week we're reading "things fall apart," by chinua achebe, one of my favorite books, one of the greatest books of all time. %$* 549
and our activity this week was about proverbs from the igbo culture and how they figure into the narration of the book. %$* 549
and so one of those problems is looking at a king’s mouth, one would think that he never sucked at his mother's breast. %$* 549
and i said to my class, "this is a very evocative proverb, very provocative, what do you think it means in relation to the protagonist, okonkwo’s struggle with his masculinity? %$* 549
" and i just called on a student at random because i like doing that-- %$* 549
it's fun-- %$* 549
and he said, "uh, i don’t know, you should never forget where you came from? %$* 549
" and i said, "okay, that's a start. %$* 549
let's do it." so we went back and forth in the class, me back to him, other students to him, other students to me. %$* 549
if you want to know how it turned out, you're going to have to come to my class, but the point is that most of the students in the class had never thought about that proverb like that before. %$* 549
they had never thought about it at all. %$* 549
this was a moment that we created together. %$* 549
this was a moment we created together in real time, face-to-face, in the same room with energy you could feel, with energy between people that you could feel, and that changed us all just a little bit. %$* 549
the second part of this motion is that the lecture hall is obsolete, and it's certainly true that in a thousand-person lecture, that kind of moment that you can feel is few and far between, but i don't think the answer is to put that lecture online in five-minute chunks. %$* 549
and i don't necessarily think it's to get rid of the classroom altogether for some fascinating sounding space technology of the future that i haven't seen yet, which sounds great. %$* 549
so that's why i hope that you will join our team in voting, "no," on the motion, "more clicks, fewer bricks: the lecture hall is obsolete." thank you. %$* 549
thank you, rebecca schuman. %$* 13
and that concludes our closing remarks, and now, at this time, to learn which side you feel has argued the best. %$* 13
i'm going to ask you again to go to the keypads at your seat. %$* 13
and now vote a second time. %$* 13
and we're going to get the readout almost instantaneously. %$* 13
same as before, you push number one if you're for the motion, number two if you are against, and number three if you became or remain undecided. %$* 13
and we'll let the voting go on for about another 15 seconds, and then we will lock it out. %$* 13
and while that is happening, i just want to say a few things. %$* 13
one is our-- %$* 13
it's our first experience in coming up to columbia, and it's been fantastic for us. %$* 13
and what really sealed that was the quality of this debate and the level of argument and enthusiasm and intelligence and decency and honesty and respect for one another that these debaters brought to the stage. %$* 13
i just want to thank them for hitting all of those marks-- %$* 13
which intelligence squared. %$* 13
we also want to give thanks again to columbia university's richard paul richman center for partnering with us for this debate. %$* 13
it is the fourth time, and it's a great partnership. %$* 13
and we hope that it continues to go forward. %$* 13
we would-- %$* 13
yeah, we'd like to have you tweet about the debate. %$* 13
the handle-- %$* 13
our handle is @iq2us and @columbia_biz, that's b-i-z. %$* 13
the hashtag for this debate is onlineed. %$* 13
our next debate is next week in midtown, april 9, at the kaufman music center. %$* 13
it's broadway and 67th. %$* 13
the motion that night is "millennials don't stand a chance." we're looking at the fact that the media often paints millennials as uniquely, you know, narcissistic and coddled and helicoptered, but we're asking also, "are we so blinded to the qualities that they embody that we should be admiring like openness and optimism and innovation? %$* 13
" for the motion we have binta niambi brown. %$* 13
she's a lawyer. %$* 13
she's a startup advisor. %$* 13
she's a human rights advocate who is named one of fortune magazine's 40 under-40 business leaders. %$* 13
her partner is w.keith campbell. %$* 13
he's a psychology professor at the university of georgia, and he is co-author of the book, "the narcissism epidemic." against them, david burstein. %$* 13
at 25 years old he has already directed two documentaries, founded a voter engagement organization, and published the book-- %$* 13
how annoying, really-- %$* 13
"fast future."his book-- %$* 13
i'm joking-- %$* 13
is "fast future: how the millennial generation is shaping our world." and his partner is jessica grose. %$* 13
she is a self-defined "ancient millennial." she's a journalist and author of the novel, "sad desk salad." and then on may 7 our final debate of the season, where we debate the question, "is death final? %$* 13
" tickets for all of that will be at our remaining spring debates, on sale through our website, www.iq2us.org. %$* 13
and for those of us who can't join our live audience, there are many other ways to join our debates that involve going online. %$* 13
you can watch the live stream at iq2us.org, on fora.tv, and listen on npr stations across the nation. %$* 13
i also want to say, jonathan cole, you sounded like you got cut off in your closing statement in the middle of something that sounded really well planned and eloquent. %$* 13
and i would like if you are okay with it to post your full text on our website so that it's-- %$* 13
so that it's up there. %$* 13
i'm sure everyone's going to go to it, yes. %$* 548
it wasn't just to make you feel better. %$* 13
i appreciate the sentiment. %$* 548
i really do. %$* 548
okay. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
so i have the final results. %$* 13
it is all in. %$* 13
you have voted twice. %$* 13
our motion is: more clicks, fewer bricks: the lecture hall is obsolete. %$* 13
remember, the way this works is the team whose numbers have changed the most between the two votes will be declared our winner. %$* 13
on the first vote on the motion: more clicks, fewer bricks: the lecture hall is obsolete, before the debate 18 percent agreed with this motion, 59 percent were against, 23 percent were undecided. %$* 13
those are the first results. %$* 13
here is the second round of voting. %$* 13
in the second round, the team arguing for the motion went from 18 percent to 44 percent. %$* 13
they picked up 26 percentage points. %$* 13
that's the number to beat. %$* 13
the team against the motion, their first vote was 59 percent. %$* 13
second vote 47 percent. %$* 13
they lost 12 percentage points. %$* 13
this vote-- %$* 13
this debate goes to the team arguing for the motion: more clicks, fewer bricks: the lecture hall is obsolete. %$* 13
our congratulations to them. %$* 13
thank you from me, john donvan, and intelligence squared u.s. we'll see you next time. %$* 13

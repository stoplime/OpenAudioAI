all right. %$* 13
taking swahili. %$* 308
all right, buzz, i want to ring the bell. %$* 13
do you guys want to-- %$* 13
swahili! %$* 308
you guys want to respond? %$* 13
jason whitlock. %$* 13
well, i hate to go back to it, but-- %$* 311
how can you justify that? %$* 308
if you have freedom, you're going to have corruption, man. %$* 311
oh, that's a good thing. %$* 308
that's part of-- %$* 311
i'm-- %$* 311
just probably-- %$* 311
i should just say it. %$* 311
i don't want to be offensive. %$* 311
you should become head of citibank, for god's sake. %$* 308
but probably-- %$* 311
i should have taken a job on wall street. %$* 311
you should have. %$* 308
look it, you-- %$* 310
it's dangerous to take-- %$* 310
this is throughout sports at every level, right? %$* 310
and the more focus and the more attention we pay to it, the more we are interested and drawn to the people who misbehave. %$* 310
but the vast majority of college football players. %$* 310
you said 7 percent of college football players have been arrested. %$* 310
that's about-- %$* 310
that's probably about the average in the college male population. %$* 310
no actually it’s not. %$* 308
wait a minute. %$* 310
hang on. %$* 310
you're talking about all these people that have-- %$* 310
look, you've got to add the numbers up. %$* 310
if you've got 30 that broke the rules, how many hundreds do you have who didn't break the rules? %$* 310
if you've got a handful of players who committed suicide and then had serious brain damage, which that makes sense, right? %$* 310
and that horrible tragedy, how many didn't commit suicide? %$* 310
buzz is going to be back next month banning marriage because of infidelity. %$* 311
let me take us to another question. %$* 13
right down in the front there, very first row. %$* 13
and remember to stand up, please. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
hi. %$* 313
my name is claire andre. %$* 313
my question is, it's been kind of black and white, either ban or not ban. %$* 313
but what-- %$* 313
what would you suggest as ways or not suggest as ways to encourage-- %$* 313
to-- %$* 313
well, can i twist your question just a tad because-- %$* 13
sure. %$* 313
i've been wondering the same thing. %$* 13
if it go-- %$* 13
would you be okay with putting it this way? %$* 13
yes, absolutely. %$* 313
to this side, is there a reformable version of college football that you guys would accept? %$* 13
because they actually are talking about let's make some changes. %$* 13
can-- %$* 13
there are suggestions reform. %$* 313
okay. %$* 13
what would be-- %$* 13
let's do it that way. %$* 13
what would your suggestions about and what-- %$* 13
i've answered that previously. %$* 311
i think a shorter season, less practice time, sharing the wealth with the athletes would be some-- %$* 311
i think in my day we played 11 games. %$* 311
now they play 14 or 15 games. %$* 311
it's ridiculous. %$* 311
it's complete and total exploitation. %$* 311
you could-- %$* 311
10-game season is completely appropriate. %$* 311
to go to a bowl game, you play in 11. you know, just the more contact, the more likely you are to get injured-- %$* 311
okay. %$* 13
so less games would be-- %$* 311
wait, let me just see if there's anything else on their list. %$* 13
i think the colleges should continue to work and with the nfl to continue to research and find better and better equipment to protect the players and to continue to-- %$* 310
to kind of tinker with the rules, create the strike zone for the quarter back, eliminate-- %$* 310
try to eliminate helmet to helmet. %$* 310
you're never going to eliminate it completely, but have a strict liability code where players who do hit helmet to helmet, you'll remove them from the game, suspend them the next time, and then make it very serious. %$* 310
okay. %$* 13
would any of those steps make a difference to new your conviction to ban college football? %$* 13
no. %$* 309
no. %$* 308
i would-- %$* 309
well, i mean, i-- %$* 308
no, no. %$* 13
go ahead, buzz. %$* 13
i want-- %$* 13
this is a very radical solution. %$* 308
it's got all sorts of problems. %$* 308
i understand that. %$* 308
but people are talking about universities. %$* 308
you license out your name. %$* 308
and basically you're creating a de facto subsidiary. %$* 308
the universities are out of it. %$* 308
you still call it usc.you still call it whatever. %$* 308
you still call it nebraska. %$* 308
you still call it syracuse. %$* 308
but it's out of the university system. %$* 308
the university gets a licensing fee. %$* 308
they negotiate it. %$* 308
it basically is a minor league system that is separate. %$* 308
or, you know what? %$* 308
you get rid of it. %$* 308
you don't penalize the players. %$* 308
you know who the biggest villain in this is? %$* 308
the nfl. the nfl does not pay a single dime for what is the greatest boondoggle and farm system ever created. %$* 308
and malcolm, malcolm-- %$* 13
so make the nfl pony up with a developmental league. %$* 308
malcolm, the other-- %$* 13
the other part of their-- %$* 13
many of their suggestions are related to making the game safer, so can you take that on? %$* 13
well, i would-- %$* 309
the thing that i would be happy with is intramural flag football. %$* 309
because you think about it, here's a chance for kids from all kinds of different backgrounds to come together-- %$* 309
you are-- %$* 310
and learn to play together in hard work and perseverance. %$* 309
i get all misty eyed thinking about it. %$* 309
now, wait a second. %$* 308
malcolm, no offense, aren't you talking about gay marriage? %$* 308
sir in the black sweater, third row. %$* 13
this way for the mic please. %$* 13
one second. %$* 13
it's coming from your right hand side. %$* 13
my name's herb antillac i'm a sports fan. %$* 314
i'm just an average person. %$* 314
if you're going to ban football, then you'd better start banning basketball and all of the other sports because they just have the same problems as football. %$* 314
this country isn't about banning. %$* 314
this is about building and it's-- %$* 314
can you turn this to a question? %$* 13
oh, sure. %$* 314
okay, thanks. %$* 13
besides the monetary amount, why do you want to ban football? %$* 314
well, i mean, you know-- %$* 308
buzz bissinger. %$* 13
if at this point i haven't made the point, then i'm really screwed-- %$* 308
because first of all, and i didn't mention this, 43 percent of the top 125 programs lose money on football. %$* 308
now, how-- %$* 308
any program that-- %$* 308
you really gave him an opening here to get-- %$* 13
any-- %$* 308
so 43 percent lose money. %$* 308
why do they maintain football programs? %$* 308
tim and i talked about this yesterday, because for some-- %$* 308
i didn't ask that. %$* 314
i asked why do you want to ban football outside of money? %$* 314
because it has nothing to do with the academic-- %$* 308
i'm amazed-- %$* 308
aren't you concerned-- %$* 308
it has everything to do with the academics. %$* 314
it does-- %$* 308
has nothing to do-- %$* 308
it provides-- %$* 314
it-- %$* 314
wait, wait, wait, wait, okay, i have to set you down because we’ve only got four seats up here, but thank you. %$* 13
can i answer? %$* 310
thank you. %$* 13
yeah, tim green would like a chance to respond to that. %$* 13
can i-- %$* 310
in your farm team system, where every school gets to have their own farm team, do the players get to go to class? %$* 310
do they get an education at the same time? %$* 310
i would think you would give the-- %$* 308
you know, it's an unwieldy mechanism. %$* 308
i think you give the players that option. %$* 308
if they want to be called, "student athletes," and they're actually going to class and they're interested in getting an education, fine, if they don't want to go, don't make them because i have a feeling that most of them probably don't want to go. %$* 308
those would be athlete students. %$* 13
easy course list, that's why unc has an easy course list-- %$* 308
well, you know, you've got to quantify that, but why do you think-- %$* 310
if they don't want to go, why do you think 70 percent are graduating as opposed to 55, 56 percent of everyone else? %$* 310
well, i said, because in many cases, you know-- %$* 308
what-- %$* 308
all right, let him finish-- %$* 13
let him answer. %$* 13
why are so many football players graduating if they don't want their degree and they don't want to go to class and they don't want to go to school? %$* 310
you're taking-- %$* 310
you-- %$* 310
wait, let him answer the question. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 310
why? %$* 308
yeah. %$* 310
buzz bissinger. %$* 13
because it's a game and because the ncaa knows and college football knows that we're under a lot of scrutiny for our graduation rates so they push him through. %$* 308
why does stanford have an easy class list that football players-- %$* 308
"here are the classes you take." why? %$* 308
tim, why? %$* 308
why would they? %$* 308
why would unc-- %$* 308
i know-- %$* 310
i have-- %$* 310
but why? %$* 308
i have alum at syracuse who had easier class loads, easier degrees than i did with an english literature degree-- %$* 310
but you're-- %$* 308
or a biosciences degree, i mean, a physics degree, an engineering degree, i mean, some people get their degrees in-- %$* 310
i don't want to disparage any other degrees, but there are all kinds of things. %$* 310
you know, if you're-- %$* 310
if you get a degree in business or a degree in the liberal arts-- %$* 310
but i-- %$* 18
an english degree. %$* 310
let's go to another question. %$* 13
right in the aisle, there. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13
hi, i also am just an average person and a sports fan. %$* 19
my name's ashley. %$* 19
there is a scholar out of duke university who has correlated the top 25 universities in the world, 22-- %$* 19
21, 22 of them are in the u.s., with the big sports programs, having an effect on bringing the community together and getting behind even if it doesn't directly contribute to the bottom line of the university or show honor. %$* 19
and that's one of the reasons that even though our recent numbers haven't been great, our overall numbers of top universities are indeed higher. %$* 19
so what is your question? %$* 13
so the question is do you feel that, that holds any weight, one of the questions that you've posed several times is what is the purpose of football and other athletics in higher education, and if it's overall to bring our universities to the top of the line-- %$* 19
so is your question is-- %$* 13
and i may be wrong-- %$* 13
but is your question what about the-- %$* 13
and this side has made this case-- %$* 13
the beneficial effect on bringing a university together, giving it an identity, giving it a sense of purpose and unity-- %$* 13
right. %$* 19
so you think that's real, and you're asking this side if that is-- %$* 13
if they think it's real and if they think it's worth it. %$* 13
right. %$* 19
malcolm gladwell. %$* 13
i-- %$* 309
you know, the thing that i always come back to that has mystified me throughout this whole debate is what on earth is so special about football? %$* 309
i mean, if 50 years ago or 75 years ago the major colleges had all decided that they would compete at monopoly-- %$* 309
and that somehow monopoly had gotten lodged in the imagination of the american scholar monopoly player. %$* 309
and that they started to give out scholarships for monopoly players and then the monopoly coaches earned millions of dollars and they built large stadia, which 1,000 people would come to watch the monopoly players compete against each other. %$* 309
and then suddenly it was observed that monopoly had gotten out of control and we said, “maybe it’s time for us to turn our back on monopoly.” i can imagine the two of you just standing up there and saying, “no.” there’s something magical about this game. %$* 309
yeah, but her question for-- %$* 13
my point is there is nothing-- %$* 309
it’s just a game. %$* 309
replace it with another game. %$* 309
but her question persists that she-- %$* 13
whether it makes no sense to you or not-- %$* 13
yeah. %$* 309
her question is she feels that this effect is there and is real, and i want to ask you if you think it’s there and if it’s real and if it’s worth it. %$* 13
my point is-- %$* 309
let me take-- %$* 13
well, go ahead. %$* 13
my point is it’s probably real but you could get it with something else. %$* 309
monopoly. %$* 309
let’s try it. %$* 309
buzz bissinger. %$* 13
well, i mean, i think, you know, it’s like anything in life. %$* 308
if a team is winning and successful with certain exceptions like a texas or an lsu or an alabama, if you’re winning students go, alumni go, if you’re losing they tend not to go. %$* 308
i’m not sure if you’re saying that the 25 biggest, best universities in the world have superb football programs because i don’t think that’s correct. %$* 308
i just don’t, because on that list is harvard, yale, penn, university of chicago, and last time i checked the ivy league sucks. %$* 308
but, anyway, it does bring students together. %$* 308
but-- %$* 308
however, there was a study done at the university of oregon by several economists that was in the national economic review that showed when the oregon football team was winning men’s grades went down significantly. %$* 308
they did-- %$* 308
you might think it’s a laugh but it’s not. %$* 308
by an equivalent of 27 sat points, they studied half as much, and they drank twice as much. %$* 308
so that’s what football does. %$* 308
it makes you drunk and stupid. %$* 308
tim green. %$* 13
malcolm, you asked what’s so special about football and i want to seriously try to answer that because i’m a dad and i encourage my kid-- %$* 310
i don’t-- %$* 310
if they don’t want to be athletes and they don’t want to play sports, that’s fine. %$* 310
they can do whatever they want to do. %$* 310
but if they want to be athletes, i encourage them. %$* 310
i’ve coached a lot of sports and i’ve coached football. %$* 310
and the thing that i love about all sports is one of the things jason said. %$* 310
teamwork. %$* 310
bringing people together for a common cause, working together, learning that even if you’re not the most important part of a team you can make a difference and help that team win, learning that you have to get along with people even if you don’t like them, to have-- %$* 310
if you have a common goal. %$* 310
the perseverance element of sports. %$* 310
and i think the thing that i love most about football is, and this is what i say to the kids i coach, i say-- %$* 310
and the parents. %$* 310
i say, “you’re going-- %$* 310
when you go out into the world you are going to be knocked down. %$* 310
you are going to be knocked down and guess what? %$* 310
it’s not always going to be fair. %$* 310
and sometimes you’re going to be cheated. %$* 310
and sometimes people are going to do things to you that they shouldn’t do."and all of this happens in a game of football, and it happens in a very confined, intense experience. %$* 310
and i’m telling you that, as a football player and football players, you learn to get knocked down-- %$* 310
but, tim-- %$* 13
“and get back up.” %$* 310
that doesn’t beat the monopoly argument because-- %$* 13
oh, it does. %$* 310
no, i mean, seriously. %$* 13
no, it does. %$* 310
because you’re talking about what’s good for the football player and they’re talking about-- %$* 13
oh, okay. %$* 310
no, you’re right. %$* 310
what’s good for the rest of the university. %$* 13
i thought he meant what’s so good about football as a player. %$* 310
look, i mean, football is a part of the american soul. %$* 308
it goes to, frankly, our celebration of-- %$* 308
we like being a violent, hard-assed country. %$* 308
what i resent is that why don’t you get all those things in the school newspaper when you put on a play? %$* 308
when you’re in the orchestra you get all these things. %$* 308
perseverance, caring. %$* 308
football players don’t really have to deal with people. %$* 308
they’re told by 23 coaches what to do and all those pursuits have much more long-lived academic pursuits. %$* 308
jason-- %$* 13
you have to write. %$* 308
jason whitlock. %$* 13
you have to learn critical thinking. %$* 308
well, i think on a college campus a lot of those endeavors that you’re talking about, and some of them-- %$* 311
i participated in my school newspaper. %$* 311
again, those tend to be segregated endeavors that don’t reach the cross section of people that football does and, you know, that’s unfortunate. %$* 311
but it’s the american reality, and football is the one thing on the field and even in the stands that seems to bring america together across a lot of different backgrounds. %$* 311
buzz bissinger. %$* 13
henry gates, sports illustrated 1981.and we all know who he is and i think we respect him obviously. %$* 308
“the blind pursuit of attainment in sports is having a devastating effect on our people. %$* 308
imbued with a belief that our principal avenue is to face and-- %$* 308
is to profit through sports, far too many black kids treat basketball courts and football fields as if they were classrooms in an alternate school system."that's henry gates. %$* 308
henry gates. %$* 308
now, henry gates also-- %$* 308
and then i'll stop. %$* 308
henry gates, he went back to his hometown. %$* 308
he asked people, how many black pro athletes do you think there were? %$* 308
the guesses were wild. %$* 308
half a million, 50,000. but what he was distressed by-- %$* 308
no one believed him when he said there are 12 times more black lawyers than pro athletes. %$* 308
20 times more dentists and 15 times more doctors. %$* 308
so i frankly think that you are selling a bill of goods to inner city kids that athletics is the way out because there are a lot of other ways out. %$* 308
jason. %$* 13
jason whitlock. %$* 13
there's many-- %$* 311
jason whitlock. %$* 13
because it's america, and because of freedom, you have to take responsibility for yourself. %$* 311
and so trust me, having gone through the athletic and academic experience, ball state university and every other university that my friends attended, they put all the academic goodies right on the table for you to take. %$* 311
and sometimes they put you in a-- %$* 311
you know, get your head and try to stuff the academic-- %$* 311
it's up to you to open your mouth and take it. %$* 311
that's america. %$* 311
and so these issues, whether we're trying to reduce to black and white sometimes are far more complicated, and it has to do with-- %$* 311
for me, i tried to quit college football. %$* 311
my parents wouldn't allow it. %$* 311
would not allow it. %$* 311
why did you want to quit? %$* 13
because it was hard. %$* 311
and me and my coach didn't get along, and i had a big mouth. %$* 311
and i tried to quit. %$* 311
and my parents are like, "good luck, buddy. %$* 311
you're on your own."and luckily i had those kinds of parents. %$* 311
they wouldn't let me quit. %$* 311
i played with a lot of guys that didn't have those kinds of parents or didn't have parents. %$* 311
and so we're blaming institutions a lot of times for things that a foundation with a kid has to be established from birth all the way up until the point you hand them over to the institution. %$* 311
and if that foundation is not there, if that support system is not there, you're going to fail. %$* 311
that's america. %$* 311
and so it's-- %$* 311
we can demonize the universities and the institutions. %$* 311
but, you know, there's clearly a breakdown in family throughout america that is most acute in african american community. %$* 311
and it contributes to a lot of these problems that mr. %$* 311
bissinger's talking about. %$* 311
okay. %$* 13
i want to do a-- %$* 13
i want to do a-- %$* 13
a break to-- %$* 13
we're going to take a quick break. %$* 13
now the quick break is over. %$* 13
and i just want to ask you to give us a round of applause to lead me back into it. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
so we are in the question-and-answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two against two, who are arguing it out over this motion: "ban college football." we're doing questions from the audience. %$* 13
front row. %$* 13
makes me nervous when i see that you've written out your question. %$* 13
i hope it's like only four lines. %$* 13
no, go ahead. %$* 13
start again, please. %$* 13
sorry. %$* 13
jason troklis i'm not a member of the media. %$* 315
a question for jason whitlock, actually: you've been talking a lot about freedom and american values, capitalist and so forth. %$* 315
i think we can all agree that college football is not-- %$* 315
and pro football is not a free labor market. %$* 315
people have to play for three years in the ncaa before they can be eligible for the draft. %$* 315
the fact that there is a draft is a little bit ridiculous. %$* 315
i think most labor economists would agree. %$* 315
my question to you is, would you do away with these restrictions on freedom for the players, number one? %$* 315
and number two, would college football exist if you did? %$* 315
i would not do away with them because, you know, i am pro restraint on freedom within reason. %$* 311
and so no, i actually think it's for the players' best benefit to go on and participate in college football. %$* 311
you know, so no, i'm not for capitalism. %$* 311
we need a system of checks and balances throughout our society. %$* 311
and so there need to be-- %$* 311
wait. %$* 309
now i'm really confused. %$* 309
i've just been listening to you for the last half hour going on about freedom and dumbing. %$* 309
and all of a sudden now you're not for freedom any more. %$* 309
well, no, i am for freedom, but-- %$* 311
except when you're not. %$* 309
no. %$* 311
that's why we have government and rules and regulations. %$* 311
and there are restraints on freedom. %$* 311
we can't kill each other. %$* 311
well, then jason, let me ask you this. %$* 308
buzz bissinger. %$* 13
and no offense. %$* 308
you definitely had concussions when you played. %$* 308
i'm convinced of that. %$* 308
but anyway, i know that was inappropriate. %$* 308
all right. %$* 308
no. %$* 311
that was a good joke. %$* 311
buzz and i are friends. %$* 311
anyway, i was doing so well up until then. %$* 308
buzz plays rough, i can handle it. %$* 311
are in favor, then of an antitrust exemption and many labor economists are who study sports in which no head coach gets more than $400,000 a year, which is a lot of money. %$* 308
are you in favor of that? %$* 308
400,000, i don't know if that would be my limit. %$* 311
but yeah, i'm for-- %$* 311
i wish congress or our government would step in and put some restraints on the ncaa and college football. %$* 311
and let's face it. %$* 308
the only reason that three-year rule is in effect is because-- %$* 308
and i think tim will agree-- %$* 308
you need that amount of time to develop as a football player. %$* 308
right. %$* 310
to be ready for the pros. %$* 308
so that's the only reason. %$* 308
you know, it's what the nfl wants. %$* 308
and basketball, which frankly-- %$* 308
major college basketball is in worse shape than football because of the one year and out. %$* 308
you know, the five starting players of kentucky, all the freshmen are leaving school. %$* 308
so, you know, everything is done basically for the sake either of money or so-called branding or the pros. %$* 308
sir, did you come all the way down from the back? %$* 13
i'm-- %$* 13
you've earned your question. %$* 13
the question is actually-- %$* 316
my name is vince percoccio i'm not a member of the media. %$* 316
it's actually to mr. %$* 316
whitlock, and it's on the topic of freedom. %$* 316
but if you do have a ban, how do you craft legislation that would make the rest of us feel somewhat uncomfortable about over %$* 316
setting a precedent that could be used to ban basketball next. %$* 311
exactly. %$* 316
exactly. %$* 316
that they decide that they don't like it. %$* 311
and it's the message from the other side is we don't like to ban things, even though we do ban things, it doesn't-- %$* 13
it always smells bad so-- %$* 13
so how did properly craft legislation to do this? %$* 316
well, can you take on-- %$* 13
can you take on-- %$* 13
you're talking about a slippery slope obviously. %$* 13
so take on-- %$* 13
take it on buzz bissinger. %$* 13
tim has played football. %$* 308
he has spoken, i think, very eloquently about why it is a special game. %$* 308
it is a special game. %$* 308
i love football. %$* 308
i do not think it has any academic purpose. %$* 308
and-- %$* 308
yeah, but he's asking about all the other sports. %$* 13
wait. %$* 308
other teams-- %$* 308
but you know, you do it. %$* 308
you do it. %$* 308
the university of chicago which was in the big 10, and jay berwanger had won the heisman trophy six years earlier in the big 10. robert hutchins said, you know what? %$* 308
this serves absolutely no academic purpose, no academic purpose. %$* 308
and he said, i know a lot of students at my school who can win 12 letters but don't know how to write one. %$* 308
and you know what? %$* 308
they got rid of it. %$* 308
they got rid of it. %$* 308
schools can get rid of it. %$* 308
bu got rid of it. %$* 308
northeastern got rid of it. %$* 308
schools get rid of it. %$* 308
chicago, how do you do it globally for the entire country? %$* 316
do you have to have federal government come in and say, everybody is banning football programs? %$* 316
well, people can sue. %$* 308
they can do this. %$* 308
they can do that. %$* 308
i think college presidents get-- %$* 308
the problem is with those salaries is they're terrified of head coaches. %$* 308
they're terrified of college coaches. %$* 308
they know at the big schools, they bring in a lot of bucks. %$* 308
yeah, but buzz, you're giving the reasons not to do it. %$* 13
you ban it. %$* 308
but what are the reasons-- %$* 13
you know what you do? %$* 308
you ban it. %$* 308
college presidents ban it and then let people sue and let-- %$* 308
then it takes-- %$* 308
who knows? %$* 308
two weeks ago at the university of florida, they shut down their computer science department, and they added $2 million a year to their athletic budget, bringing their-- %$* 309
the football program share of that budget to $78 million. %$* 309
now, they didn't think of the banning of computer science at the university of florida as setting a dangerous precedent. %$* 309
all right. %$* 13
let's hear from the other side. %$* 13
so if that's the case, i'm not so worried about the football-- %$* 309
tim green. %$* 13
why can't we-- %$* 310
to jason's point about freedom, why can't florida spend their money on one thing instead of another? %$* 310
why can't the university of chicago discontinue football and focus on academics? %$* 310
this is-- %$* 310
why can't we choose? %$* 310
why can't we choose? %$* 310
and if someone is-- %$* 310
if a football program is losing money, and a school wants to discontinue it, well, why don't they? %$* 310
why don't they? %$* 310
they don't because somewhere along the line some benefit is inuring to that university. %$* 310
and that's why they do it. %$* 310
and i just don't understand why you'd say, well, let's ban it. %$* 310
if it's so unproductive, if it's so counterproductive to everything that's going on, it would ban itself. %$* 310
hmm. %$* 13
but, you know, it's not going to ban itself because the amount of money that is now involved that has been poured in that certainly wasn't there in the '60s by espn and cbs-- %$* 308
is so enormous that it's just going to create a bigger and bigger monster. %$* 308
and i guess, i don't know, call me silly. %$* 308
these are difficult times for this country. %$* 308
we can put our head in the sand, and sing the national anthem, and say everything's going to be great, and we can believe in myths, a great country changes. %$* 308
there was no china in the 1960s that was competing. %$* 308
there was no india. %$* 308
there was no south korea. %$* 308
and, call me naïve, i really do think that these universities have to be almost exclusively about education. %$* 308

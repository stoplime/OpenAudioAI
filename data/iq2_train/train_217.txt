they have to be raised in an environment where they can stay healthy without their daily dose of antibiotics, which urvashi spoken out. %$* 58
they have to be given access to outside, unless it's 20 below and the weather would be dangerous for them. %$* 58
but they have to be raised in a much more humane way. %$* 58
that's built right into the rules; all organic farmers have to do it. %$* 58
if you care about how animals are cared for, if you care-- %$* 58
it's great that we can buy cheap bacon and eggs done cost much. %$* 58
if you do care how animals are cared for, organic agriculture with the only system of agriculture backed up by solid rules that require sound animal welfare: one of the reasons that we hope you'll vote against the motion. %$* 58
that concludes round one of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
the motion being argued is “organic food is marketing hype.” we now have the results of where you, the several hundred of you in our live audience stood on the motion before the debate began. %$* 13
the motion is organic food is marketing hype. %$* 13
we asked you to vote, tell us whether you stand for, against, or undecided on this motion. %$* 13
here are the results. %$* 13
before the debate, 21% of you are for the motion, 45% against, and 34% undecided. %$* 13
that's where things stand at the beginning of the debate. %$* 13
we'll ask you to vote once again when the debate has concluded. %$* 13
the team that has changed the most minds will be declared our winner. %$* 13
now on to round two: it's our middle round. %$* 13
and it's where the debaters address each other directly and also take questions from you in the audience and from me as well, as moderator. %$* 13
i'd like to begin with a question to the side that's arguing for the motion that organic food is marketing hype. %$* 13
in your critique of those who support and believe in organic food and organic farming, there is just-- %$* 13
there are these intimations of elitism that people who like organic food are people who use words like “intimations,” for example. %$* 13
that it's just a little bit snobby and a little bit snotty. %$* 13
in fact, the research shows that the majority of people who buy organic food in this country are at the higher end of the educational scale. %$* 13
i want to ask you, are you saying that all of these well educated people are actually rather stupid? %$* 13
are they missing the point? %$* 13
john krebs. %$* 13
you're absolutely right that people who purchase organic food tend to be from the wealthier sections of society simply because it's more expensive to buy. %$* 560
and that's, you know-- %$* 560
you folks that buy it, you can afford it. %$* 560
there are plenty of people out this in this country who couldn't afford to do it. %$* 560
does it mean that you're stupid? %$* 560
absolutely not. %$* 560
but it means that to some extent, you have bought in to what i claim is marketing hype. %$* 560
if i can just go back to urvashi's opening comment, it is absolutely marketing hype that the claim that organic food is healthier for you, and that's why the advertising regulator in the u.k. stamped down on the two major retailers that made this claim, as well as on the organic producer body, the soil association who was making the same claim. %$* 560
it was hype. %$* 560
there was no case to support it. %$* 560
and it was banned. %$* 560
if that isn't a straight forward piece of hype, exaggeration, implicit deception, i don't know what is. %$* 560
jeffrey steingarten. %$* 13
i wonder how long you conducted the million-- %$* 563
the lady study. %$* 563
was it six months or six weeks, was it two years? %$* 563
jeffrey, what's your point? %$* 13
why are you raising that? %$* 13
many of the toxins in pesticides, herbicides could take years and years. %$* 563
what about that, john krebs? %$* 13
do you think it's too soon to know? %$* 13
the million women study is still going on. %$* 560
it's been going on now for about eight years. %$* 560
it will continue for another probably 15 or so years. %$* 560
so we're looking at long term effect and no effects have shown up so far. %$* 560
urvashi rangan. %$* 13
i think we're talking about elitism but it's really that organic food costs more. %$* 561
organic food costs more to produce, and there are a couple reasons for that. %$* 561
one is that it's incredibly physically labor intensive. %$* 561
you've got to-- %$* 561
as jeffrey pointed out, you have to pull the weed. %$* 561
you can't just spray a chemical on it. %$* 561
it's harder to do. %$* 561
so there is no question that organic food is harder to produce. %$* 561
but the other major factor that has not been mentioned today is the amazing subsidies that all of our taxpayer money goes to to support cheap food production to subsidize late crops on corn and soy, and the myriad of ingredients that stem from that that end up in processed foods, hence creating cheat processed foods. %$* 561
organic doesn't get subsidies. %$* 561
that's why between that and what it does, it costs more. %$* 561
blake hurst. %$* 13
beg to differ-- %$* 562
of course, organic qualifies. %$* 562
same subsidies that i do, subsidies are tied to the ground. %$* 562
they don't ask how you produce the crop. %$* 562
my question-- %$* 562
i guess i would like to ask, you talked about fertilizer raping the soil. %$* 562
how does the soil know the difference between-- %$* 562
i mean nitrogen, you look at your periodic table. %$* 562
there it is, it appears. %$* 562
when i apply nitrogen on some of our acres for manure, when i apply some nitrogen from some of our acres, commercial fertilizer, how does the soil know the difference? %$* 562
charles benbrook. %$* 13
i'll speak to nitrogen. %$* 58
one of the major problems around the world, back in february 23, those of you that read the “wall street journal,” there was a remarkable story about how the subsidies in india for nitrogen fertilizer started back in the green revolution days have actually led to such excessive nitrogen fertilizer use in india, that what happens when you put extra nitrogen on ground, you stimulate microbial activity in the soil. %$* 58
and those microbes, they eat your organic matter, in effect, which degrades your soil quality. %$* 58
and the “journal,” it was a very interesting and hard hitting story. %$* 58
and it was just a week after in “science magazine,” there was a major research report that dennis may have seen about china and how there is this major problem in china about the acidification of soils from too much nitrogen. %$* 58
in america, in the midwest, less than 35% of the nitrogen that gets applied winds up supporting the growth of that corn plant. %$* 58
and the rest, some of it goes into the water and some of it volatizes into the environment. %$* 58
organic farmers, on the other hand, nitrogen is expensive to them because they don't have access to these cheap commercial sources of readily available nitrogen fertilizers. %$* 58
they have to get their nitrogen the old fashioned way with cover crops and legumes and compost. %$* 58
it's dear to them and it’s valuable. %$* 58
and they use it much more carefully. %$* 58
they don't need as much to support the same amount of growth. %$* 58
they don't pollute the water. %$* 58
they don't contribute as much to global warming. %$* 58
and they improve the quality of the soil and it's these sorts of win, win, wins that are why even the usda acknowledges that organic farming is better for the environment. %$* 58
and that's one of the claims. %$* 58
dennis avery of the hudson institute. %$* 13
there is a new set of products on the market from arcadia biosciences. %$* 564
they're actually the product of a-- %$* 564
a research mistake at the university of alberta. %$* 564
they were trying for drought tolerant crops and instead, they got nitrogen-efficient crops. %$* 564
rapeseed, rice and wheat; you can now put on half as much organic nitrogen, get in effect what we thought of as a full crop, with very little left in the soil to leach into the nearby streams. %$* 564
can we hope that the organic farmers will, at some point, recognize this benefit and help protect the water with nitrogen efficient biotech crops? %$* 564
what does that have to do with how organic food is marketed in the united states? %$* 58
what's the point? %$* 58
i want to ask blake hurst, because you're our only farmer possibly in the room. %$* 13
i think there may be some farmers in the audience, but certainly on the panel. %$* 13
in terms of just the reality check that you can provide to us, a guy who gets his hands in the soils, what have you heard tonight that is the most out of touch with what really happens in the real world? %$* 13
i get this idea that-- %$* 562
jeffrey says that conventional farming is not feeding the world, so his solution is to produce less food? %$* 562
i mean this idea-- %$* 562
it is, indeed-- %$* 562
totally wrong. %$* 563
if you're growing corn-- %$* 563
let's let blake answer that question. %$* 13
yeah, well give me your example. %$* 562
if you're growing corn on two pieces of land, farmers told me this, two pieces of land, one conventionally and one organically, the conventional plot will produce more corn. %$* 563
if you have less than a modern culture, the number of calories produced on the organic piece of land, which is what we care about, the number of calories on the organic land will be greater than on the conventional land. %$* 563
what's your source for that? %$* 562
that's impossible. %$* 564
i would like to know the source. %$* 562
charles can tell you. %$* 563
i'm not a scientist. %$* 563
tell him charles. %$* 13
charles benbrook. %$* 13
this is an important point. %$* 58
on blake's farm, we were speaking on the right over here. %$* 58
you'll be getting out in the field pretty soon to plant corn, right? %$* 58
in the next couple weeks that corn will germinate in 10 days. %$* 58
it will grow vigorously capturing solar radiation, pulling up nitrogen from the soil, and producing a crop for about 90 days. %$* 58
after 90 days it goes into synapsis. %$* 58
it has to dry so he can get his combine in, and really, from the second week in august, maybe the third week in august, that field really isn't growing anything more. %$* 58
organic farming is based on a much more diverse set of crops. %$* 58
organic farmers are going to get a cover crop on to the corn ground as soon its harvested so that that fall solar radiation is captured and supports biomass which support microorganisms in the soil. %$* 58
so the way that organic farmers can and do produce more per acre is they produce multiple crops. %$* 58
they integrate livestock and often fish with their crops. %$* 58
and they're using that solar radiation in the early spring and the late fall when it's not as intense in the summer. %$* 58
if you drive through the midwest, our greatest agriculture regulation, it's only producing a crop for about 90 days of the year. %$* 58
and there are at least six weeks in the spring and fall when it could be growing something. %$* 58
and something is growing on all the organic farms. %$* 58
that's how-- %$* 58
john krebs is also a scientist can respond to that. %$* 13
another way to-- %$* 564
dennis, i'm going to led john krebs respond. %$* 13
i have a simple question to jeffrey. %$* 560
if indeed organic production is more efficient, produces more yield per hectare than conventional, why is organic food more than expensive? %$* 560
who is making all this extra money? %$* 560
the reason it's more expensive is because you get less per hectare. %$* 560
no, because it is-- %$* 563
first of all, there is industrial organic, the farming about which i don't know a lot. %$* 563
sorry, could you say that again? %$* 560
what? %$* 560
why is it more expensive? %$* 563
no. %$* 560
what were the two source of organic? %$* 560
you said there is industrial organic and there is something else organic. %$* 560
a smaller scale? %$* 560
there is industrial organic. %$* 563
when we're talking about marketing hype are we talking about the system organic are or we taking-- %$* 560
yeah, we're talking about healthy organic. %$* 563
just a minute. %$* 560
no evidence that it's healthier. %$* 560
yes, i know. %$* 563
i was just trying to get you. %$* 563
did it work? %$* 563
the reason it's more expensive because it involves a lot of hand labor. %$* 563
you have to hire in the-- %$* 563
in the northeast you have to hire either migrant laborers or you have to build them houses. %$* 563
the best apple farmer in this whole area builds houses for her laborers, and then sends them to school, sends the kids to school. %$* 563
i guess the farmers are not in that position. %$* 563
but there is a lot of hand work. %$* 563
you can't have a combine coming through and doing whatever a combine does. %$* 563
plus also, i understand that this whole tillage argument-- %$* 563
i have been told that organic farming does not require tilling. %$* 563
is that true or do you know-- %$* 563
no, that is not true. %$* 562
it's bare earth farming. %$* 562
organic farming is bare earth farming. %$* 562
dennis can you respond to charles' point that he made about essentially that an organic farmer is working a more diverse range of-- %$* 13
working the soil in more diverse ways by introducing different crops and its interaction with livestock? %$* 13
it's certainly working in more diverse ways. %$* 564
and i want to compliment the organic movement for having been concerned from the beginning with the health of the soil. %$* 564
unfortunately, unfortunately they aren't using it very well. %$* 564
and the point he made about the corn getting its growth in the first 90 days means that the organic farmers are starving their corn for part of that 90 days. %$* 564
they are not getting what that field could produce because the organic nitrogen is slow release. %$* 564
urvashi, do you want to come in on this? %$* 13
it is a strange argument. %$* 561
and what i guess i want to-- %$* 561
i want to zoom out a little bit and talk about genetically modified crops. %$* 561
the u.n.has issued two reports actually, one just recently and one a few years ago. %$* 561
that for africa and eastern europe, organic agriculture is the answer for those areas for maintaining the sustainable food production supply. %$* 561
the second thing that also has-- %$* 561
why? %$* 13
what is this logic of that? %$* 13
why is organic the answer for those areas? %$* 13
it resides within many of the reasons we're talking about, sustainable production, jobs, less pesticides, less inputs. %$* 561
those things cost money. %$* 561
while our opponents are reporting the miracles of genetic modification, and pesticides, and how wonderful they are, what most consumers don't know is that those things were not required to be tested for how well they work or how safe they are before they got out on the market. %$* 561
and those are the aspects that the u.n. is considering when they make those reports available and anyone is free to read those reports. %$* 561
blake hurst. %$* 13
of course there is long and extensive testing for-- %$* 562
what the national resource council says-- %$* 562
genetically modified seed is tested before it goes on the market. %$* 562
how many of you have bought genetically modified seed? %$* 562
how many of you have toured montsanto's laboratories? %$* 562
how many of you know the process that it goes through? %$* 562
i have. %$* 58
the point i'm making is that that's blatantly untrue. %$* 562
as to the point of whether it works or not, i guess that is the that's the consumer-- %$* 562
because the nrc says that there is no conceptual distinction, that's the national research council, your government, no conceptual distinction exists between genetically modification of plants and microorganisms by classical methods or by molecular techniques that modify dna and transfer genes. %$* 562
there is no difference. %$* 562
it's just a faster and more effective way of improving crops. %$* 562
the biggest mistake the organics standard made was not accepting genetically modified seeds. %$* 562
absolutely. %$* 562
i'd like to go to the audience for some questions. %$* 13
how this works is that if you raise your hand and i find you, i'll ask you to stand up. %$* 13
if you're a member of the news media, we'd prefer that you tell us that fact, who you work for. %$* 13
you'll be given a microphone. %$* 13
and hold the microphone about that far from-- %$* 13
one fist away from your mouth so that the radio can pick you up. %$* 13
i just have a question before we get there. %$* 13
what strikes me about this debate is that the tone here is as bitterly partisan as anything that's happening in washington. %$* 13
and i'm curious about why that is. %$* 13
and it's on both sides. %$* 13
it's also from all of us here in the hall. %$* 13
there is a nasty feeling to this issue. %$* 13
and i'm curious about why-- %$* 13
we're talking about food. %$* 13
what we eat. %$* 13
i want to hear from one panelist, nominate yourself on each side, about why are we there? %$* 13
in this topic? %$* 13
charles, you're nodding. %$* 13
you represent the organic center. %$* 13
why? %$* 13
the organic food industry-- %$* 58
it actually deserves the word industry, now accounts for about 3% of our food supply. %$* 58
it's not threatening the profits of cargill and adm and craft and general mills in the marketplace, yet, but it is in the world of ideas. %$* 58
and with all due respect to john krebs, the science is strongly lining up behind organic farming. %$* 58
it is more nutrient-dense. %$* 58
there are 70 or 80 studies that have reached that conclusion. %$* 58
to just dismiss them that they're not there, you know, you can do it. %$* 58
but if you read science, it's there. %$* 58
so i think organic food and what this whole area represents, it worries the conventional agriculturist to that people are going to start to ask questions about how our food is grown and what's in it, and how it might be contributing to the fact that we americans spend more than any nation in the world on healthcare, but our health across a number of measures really doesn't stack up that well. %$* 58
and i think it's a lot about what we eat. %$* 58
john krebs, do you want to-- %$* 13
not just respond, but to take on my question. %$* 13
well, as i said at the beginning, you would expect those with organic on their business card to play the claim that organic food is better for you. %$* 560
not surprising, chuck, well done. %$* 560
but why is this such a divisive issue? %$* 560
it's a divisive issue because it's a side show from the real problems that we face which are first of all about feeding the growing world population as dennis said. %$* 560
and second of all, for those of us who are lucky to live in an affluent society, to eat a healthy balanced diet and secure our own health. %$* 560
organic food is a complete side show to both of those issues. %$* 560
those of us who care deeply about those issues are very frustrated by the repeated claims of the organic sector explicit or implicit that they will solve these problems. %$* 560
so it sounds like each side thinks the other side is actually doing harm here? %$* 13
exactly. %$* 560
not just disagreeing but doing harm. %$* 13
gentlemen, right there you could rise and hold the mic close to you, and please make it a brief question. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
one of the points that mr. %$* 18
avery made was that we need to significantly increase food production. %$* 18
and i'd like to just suggest that in making fun of meatless monday, you are asking a question about the concerns of livelihood of millions of people. %$* 18
1.7 million people who died of heart disease, diabetes, stroke, and cancer last year because of easily attributed to a number of academic studies to their eating meats. %$* 18
my question is, wouldn't reducing meat production significantly reduce overall agricultural production requirements? %$* 18
i'm going to pass on the question with respect because it's really-- %$* 13
i don't think it's on our topic of organic food and marketing hype. %$* 13
it's a question about meat versus vegetables, i believe. %$* 13
if the question is about subsidy, we're talking about how people are not getting access to make an even playing field for organic foods. %$* 18
and meat is a huge-- %$* 18
i think we're off topic. %$* 13
but with respect, thank you. %$* 13
yes, right there. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
i am a member of the media. %$* 19
i work at martha stewart living, and i worked on cookbooks. %$* 19
but i have a question. %$* 19
one of the things that hasn't been addressed here at all tonight is the question of flavor. %$* 19
we're talking about marketing hype. %$* 19
it's hard to get away from the fact that an organic banana tastes like a banana, or an organic peach takes like a peach. %$* 19
and, you know, that’s less and less true of conventional produce. %$* 19
so what's the question? %$* 13
no, but it's better organic, which is good. %$* 13
the question is where is-- %$* 19
you know, where is the hype if we're really looking at flavor? %$* 19
are you actually-- %$* 13
your question really is, does an organic taste food better, and isn't that one of its benefits? %$* 13
yes. %$* 19
right? %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
fair question. %$* 13
i guess that's what is the question. %$* 19
fair question. %$* 13
fair question. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13
john, believe it or not, this question actually is germane to the debate. %$* 58
i agree that it is. %$* 13
i just want the other side to answer it. %$* 13
i'll come back to it, though. %$* 13
i have been privileged to watch a program taped by a couple of comedians who perform primarily in las vegas who conducted a number of blind taste tests on the street in las vegas. %$* 564
and nobody could tell the difference from nothing. %$* 564
i grew up on a farm. %$* 564
our tomatoes, during the height of the growing-- %$* 564
of the harvest season, were wonderful. %$* 564
the rest of the year, we didn't get tomatoes except out of cans. %$* 564
this whole freshness thing, fresher tastes better. %$* 564
if your organic is fresher, it may taste better. %$* 564
but that's apart from its being organic. %$* 564
charles. %$* 13
i think-- %$* 58
charles benbrook. %$* 13
i think this is-- %$* 58
i really appreciate this question because it's very important. %$* 58
the organic food industry has not claimed that organic food tastes better. %$* 58
and the reason that-- %$* 58
they know it does sometimes, but they don't have the systems in place and the ability to guarantee a consumer that it's always going to taste better. %$* 58
and it's an example of where the industry has not gone over that line to hype its products. %$* 58
now, there're some consumers out there that are convinced that it always tastes better. %$* 58
and maybe to them, it does. %$* 58
but i actually think the organic food industry has been fairly responsible in not getting beyond the science and beyond what they can guarantee. %$* 58
and i think that they deserve a certain degree of respect for this. %$* 58
and they certainly deserve your vote to this motion because they haven't gone out of their way and made claims. %$* 58
now, some people say-- %$* 58
you know, some consumers-- %$* 58
the woman that john spoke about, being guilty about not eating organic food. %$* 58
that's a shame. %$* 58
you know, all mothers should feed their kids lots of fruits and vegetables, organic or conventional. %$* 58
but you can't hold that against the industry that's trying to be responsible in telling people about what the true benefits are and they are significant. %$* 58
okay. %$* 13
so we're in the question-and-answer section of this intelligence u.s.-- %$* 13
we're in the question-and-answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan of abc news, your moderator. %$* 13
and we have six debaters, two teams of three, debating this motion, "organic food is marketing hype." we're going back to the audience for questions. %$* 13
gentleman in the blue shirt. %$* 13
hello. %$* 18
this question is for dr. %$* 18
rangan. %$* 18
you talked about the fact that-- %$* 18
or you claim there was a fact that organic food could be verified, and there were standards for organic food. %$* 18
my understanding is that's not true, that the standards are for organic farming and that there's a difference between process and product and that the standards do not say anything about the products. %$* 18
it's just the process by which the product is obtained. %$* 18
so my question for you is, if i gave you an apple, and you had to do an analysis to determine whether it was organic or not, and it was a scientific analysis, presumably a chemical or physical analysis, what exactly would you do to verify that it was an organic apple? %$* 18
yeah, your point is well taken. %$* 561
it is production. %$* 561
it's the organic food production act. %$* 561
and it's about production. %$* 561
and the seal is on the food, and it is about what goes into the production of that apple or that orange. %$* 561
and just incidentally, there's also a whole scientific advisory board that reviews and approves materials that are allowed and printed in processed foods as well as in fresh foods. %$* 561
so there is a whole framework around that. %$* 561
and that's what we're here to talk about today. %$* 561
that is the foundation of what it is. %$* 561
how would you test for a food that was organic? %$* 561
you might look for genetic modification. %$* 561
that's prohibited. %$* 561
if it's a banana, we can taste it. %$* 13
in fact, your point goes-- %$* 561
it's very difficult to test for whether something's organic or not. %$* 561
if it had prohibited residues, you might know that it wasn't. %$* 561
but the point is-- %$* 561
and that's why there is so much recordkeeping involved. %$* 561
there is so much work involved for a farmer to become organic because the whole paper trail of what went into that farm has to be documented. %$* 561
everything that went into the particular jam that was processed has to be documented. %$* 561
those things aren't required for conventional agriculture. %$* 561
john-- %$* 13
and the materials used are restricted. %$* 561
and-- %$* 561
john krebs to respond. %$* 13
that is the framework that exists. %$* 561
it's a very interesting question. %$* 560
when i was head of the food standards agency, we started sponsoring research to develop such tests. %$* 560
and such tests can be developed because this is a bit of technical chemistry. %$* 560
the isotopes of carbon and nitrogen that come from chemical fertilizers are different from the isotopes out of manure or compost. %$* 560
but the organic movement strongly opposed this, and they said it was a complete waste of money to develop these tests. %$* 560
they never said why they thought it was a complete waste of money. %$* 560
but i thought i had a pretty good idea that a lot of the produce that's on sale as organic is not actually genuinely organic. %$* 560
and i think it would be a good thing if the regulators did use tests like that and really showed what was on sale in the shops. %$* 560
well, john, i think you should speak for the u.k.on that because there's a lot of us that follow what goes on in the united states. %$* 58
the organic label has meaning in this country. %$* 58
let's go back to the audience for questions. %$* 13
does the regulator carry out the tests? %$* 560
no. %$* 58
ma'am, can you see me looking at you? %$* 13
they enforce the rules. %$* 58
if you could stand up, yes, and we'll bring a microphone. %$* 13
and if-- %$* 13
it'll be handed down to you. %$* 13
you don't need to work your way up. %$* 13
question, please, now. %$* 13
yes, question. %$* 19
thank you. %$* 19
my question is that for people who are interested in sustainably produced agriculture, there's some consumer concern that the rise of industrial organic agriculture, which was touched on briefly, has sort of called into question the rigorous standards that are in place for determining whether something is organic or not. %$* 19
and i was hoping the panel could speak to that. %$* 19
how rigorous it is and if-- %$* 19
i know people-- %$* 563
i know people who have compared factory chicken production in the conventional way of doing it and in the organic way of doing it. %$* 563
now, it's still about factory chicken production. %$* 563
but it is, number one, the chickens don't have to have access to the outside. %$* 563
they have to have been outside. %$* 563
if you have something that passes the organic tests, it gets the approval of a certifier, who is also certified by the department of agriculture, there was nothing you're going to have to fear about the food. %$* 563
raising animals in a humane way-- %$* 563
i go to the green market twice a week. %$* 563
there are people who raise animals in a conventional humane way. %$* 563
but most conventional agriculture does not do that. %$* 563
and i would say that the organic movement should receive-- %$* 563
that's why you have to pay more because it-- %$* 563
but ma'am, are you-- %$* 13
and we're getting very bad karma by eating this-- %$* 563
ma'am, are you asking do we know-- %$* 13
are you asking do we really know how rigid the rules are and whether they're being followed? %$* 13
yes. %$* 19
you're asking-- %$* 13
some of the regulations are in place in organic-- %$* 19
when people buy organic, they assume that-- %$* 19
excuse me, can we pass her a microphone? %$* 19
i'll repeat it for her. %$* 13
oh, i'm sorry. %$* 13
you want to-- %$* 13
sure. %$* 19
when people are-- %$* 19
can we pass the microphone? %$* 19
yeah, sorry. %$* 19
my question is, when you're buying organic, you're assuming certain things about the production of the food. %$* 19
and when things are produced on farms that can be considered factory farms when they're such large scale, can the standards be scaled up to some of the sizes of farms that we're seeing? %$* 19
okay. %$* 13
i'm going to let blake take the question, but i don't quite understand it, so if you could rephrase it. %$* 13

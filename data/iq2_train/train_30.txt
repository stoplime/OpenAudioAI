first, i would say, our answer would be the same, just as it would be the same if a legislation were adopted, as this would have-- %$* 204
barring citizens united itself-- %$* 204
a conservative organization-- %$* 204
from putting on a movie denouncing hillary clinton when she was running for president, because it took some for-profit corporate money. %$* 204
so, that blends together. %$* 204
now, beyond that, the supreme court in the citizens united case referred to the fact that 24 states, as of that time, have laws barring for-profit corporations from expending money on political matters. %$* 204
26 did not. %$* 204
had no laws. %$* 204
anything of that sort. %$* 204
unlimited spending was allowed. %$* 204
there was no evidence ever-- %$* 204
there is none now-- %$* 204
that the 26 states were more corrupt, less democratic, less responsive than was true with respect to the 24 states. %$* 204
i'm not surprised by that and i have to confess to you, even if i thought that the 26 states were probably less well-managed, i'd have the same first amendment view. %$* 204
but the empirical evidence is that it doesn't affect corruption in a state and there's no reason to think that it affects it in the federal government. %$* 204
let's-- %$* 13
let zephyr teachout respond to that, because-- %$* 13
of course-- %$* 18
corruption has been your theme on this one. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 206
no, i would-- %$* 206
i also took some issue with the framing of the question. %$* 206
and actually, floyd alluded to this. %$* 206
he said we might take a-- %$* 206
i might take a different stance if i saw that there was another value that was outweighed. %$* 206
so, i would-- %$* 206
might maybe frame it, you know, "do the people, through their representative electives, have the power to protect against corruption in ways that don't then infringe upon the core right to dissent and express one's views? %$* 206
or something else-- %$* 206
that i do think these framing questions matter a great deal. %$* 206
i understood the question to cover for-profit as well, and to be framed in a way to be-- %$* 206
for-profit, non-profit, and individual. %$* 206
well, and it also covers not-for-profit, because i think i heard burt trying to carve that out. %$* 51
yeah. %$* 205
and we-- %$* 51
yeah. %$* 205
i don't-- %$* 205
i don't have a problem with not-for-profits speaking. %$* 205
well, that's what i'm saying. %$* 51
you tried to carve it out of the restrictions, and yet the laws haven't done so. %$* 51
well, but-- %$* 205
the laws haven't-- %$* 51
we're not-- %$* 205
we're not debating-- %$* 205
we're not debating whether the statutes were well- drafted. %$* 205
we're debating a proposition. %$* 205
let me answer-- %$* 205
burt, would-- %$* 13
just-- %$* 13
just for the point, would unions also be-- %$* 13
unions-- %$* 205
part of it? %$* 13
would be covered too. %$* 205
of course. %$* 205
yeah. %$* 13
corporations have no souls. %$* 205
the first amendment is about protecting human dignity. %$* 205
it is a-- %$* 205
it is an obscenity to take one of the sublime protections in human history and turn it into an instrument of protection for managers of these corporations, to use other people's money to advance their own views. %$* 205
there is absolutely no basis for thinking that a corporation can speak, can pray, can marry, can adopt, can do the things that a human being does-- %$* 205
because what we care about is protecting souls-- %$* 205
burt-- %$* 204
in the first amendment. %$* 205
burt – i mean, i-- %$* 204
i've spent most of my life representing large corporations with-- %$* 204
no, with enormous power called the new york time, and called cbs, and called npr. i could represent this-- %$* 204
this is a corporation here. %$* 204
our hosts here are corporations. %$* 204
the national constitution center is a corporation. %$* 204
and it doesn't have blood, and it doesn't have a soul. %$* 204
stop. %$* 204
floyd, you're the best – %$* 205
and-- %$* 19
we have time for one more question. %$* 13
let's bring it down here. %$* 13
richard phillips. %$* 209
we all-- %$* 209
we laughed earlier at burt neuborne's hypothetical about buying more time in this very debate. %$* 209
but i didn't hear a direct response. %$* 209
and i think it's worth asking-- %$* 209
if the purpose of the first amendment is truly to increase the free exchange of ideas because it's so critical to the health of the rest of the document that we need that free exchange of ideas. %$* 209
if we had begun this debate by measuring everybody's bank accounts and allotting the debate time accordingly, would it have resulted in a free exchange of ideas or a less free exchange of ideas? %$* 209
and i want to-- %$* 18
i would certainly have spoken last. %$* 206
i want to answer that by saying-- %$* 204
floyd abrams. %$* 13
if the government had a law saying that the amount of time for each of us must be equal because otherwise it just wouldn't be fair, that would be a terribly and obviously unconstitutional law. %$* 204
it isn't fair-- %$* 204
it isn't fair to have a situation in which we get-- %$* 204
i want to posit it in our favor now-- %$* 204
in which we get all the time and they get just a bit. %$* 204
but the purpose of the first amendment i think is different than you think. %$* 204
one of the results of the first amendment is more things are said, hopefully more people get educated. %$* 204
but we don't limit the first amendment if people don't get educated or if less is said. %$* 204
the first amendment is designed to protect us first from the congress, the entity that they think should pass laws limiting speech. %$* 204
that's the beginning and almost the end of it. %$* 204
last word in this round goes to burt neuborne. %$* 13
floyd, you're the best lawyer i know. %$* 205
and what you've just done is twisted. %$* 205
the question was not should we all be equal. %$* 205
no one is suggesting that legislation gets passed mandating strict equality. %$* 205
the question is, should some of us, 1/10 of one percent of the population be so unequal that we get to dominate everybody else? %$* 205
and that concludes round two of this intelligence squared u.s.debate where our motion is "individuals and organizations have a constitutional right to unlimited spending on their own political speech." and remember again how you voted before the debate. %$* 13
we're going to have you vote immediately after our closing round in which the debaters will have two minutes each to summarize their positions. %$* 13
onto round three, closing statements from each debater in turn. %$* 13
our motion is this: individuals and organizations have a constitutional right to unlimited spending on their own political speech. %$* 13
and here to summarize her position supporting this motion, nadine strossen, a professor at new york law school and former president of the acla. %$* 13
tonight's debate ultimately turns on the following question: how much faith do we have in our democratic egalitarian ideals? %$* 51
are we willing to assume, as our constitution does, that our fellow citizens can be entrusted with the right to decide which speakers and ideas to accept and which to reject? %$* 51
are we really going to trust we the people? %$* 51
sure, many of us have a healthy distrust of powerful, wealthy people in groups. %$* 51
but no one has anything approaching the power or wealth of the united states government. %$* 51
here's what-- %$* 51
one judge put it this way: the government has unlimited resources for touting its agenda. %$* 51
those on the outside must rely on private wealth to make their voices heard. %$* 51
so it violates democratic egalitarian ideals that we hear our opponents espouse for incumbents to limit what the rest of us may spend to make our voices heard. %$* 51
basically you have government insiders trying to justify these limits on all of us, the outsiders, by speculating, well, maybe some people will have dangerous ideas, or they're suspect speakers because they happen to be organized in corporate form. %$* 51
and that might lead to some potential appearance of corruption. %$* 51
but that kind of paternalism has always been rejected in our free speech tradition. %$* 51
we can't say because speech might lead to a risk of crime that it can be suppressed, much less to an appearance of a risk of crime. %$* 51
and we've cited many examples where people-- %$* 51
it's as inaccurate as it is insulting and condescending to say that we are automatically going to vote for the candidate who spends the most money or trust the candidate who's in the pocket of high financiers. %$* 51
so please show your trust in the people by voting for the proposition. %$* 51
thank you, nadine strossen. %$* 13
our motion: individuals and organizations have a constitutional right to unlimited spending on their own political speech, and here to summarize his position opposing this motion, burt neuborne, a professor at nyu law and former national legal director of the acla. %$* 13
please, show your support for the people by voting, because the people want these laws. %$* 205
every single law that we're talking about are laws that were overwhelmingly supported by the people and overwhelmingly passed by a representative democracy. %$* 205
it is five members of the supreme court and a group of ideologues who are telling us that we cannot have these laws because there is some magic formula in the supreme court that tells us that our democracy has to be dominated by the rich. %$* 205
floyd correctly-- %$* 205
because floyd is-- %$* 205
has values that i share. %$* 205
we've worked together so many times. %$* 205
floyd says there's many things wrong with this country, and we should fix it. %$* 205
we should fix our tax system, we should fix all sorts of things that are desperately wrong. %$* 205
and i tell you, we can't fix it. %$* 205
there is no way that fixing a system that is rigged in favor of the rich-- %$* 205
and if you allow the rich to control who gets elected to fix that system. %$* 205
our system is broken. %$* 205
it's broken because a few of us have so much power that we can control what the rest of us do, not every time, of course not every election is dealt that way. %$* 205
but over time, and through most of what we do, the rich have an immensely larger political influence than any of the rest of us. %$* 205
and unless we can do something about dealing with that, unless we the people can pass legislation that will limit their ability to spend unlimited amounts to carry out their policies, those are the policies that you had better learn to live with because there will never be a representative democracy in this country that will change those policies until we change the power structure of how we run our elections. %$* 205
thank you, burt neuborne. %$* 13
the motion, "individuals and organizations have a constitutional right to unlimited spending on their own political speech," here summarizing his position supporting this motion, floyd abrams, an attorney who represented the new york times in the pentagon papers case and senator mitch mcconnell in citizens united. %$* 13
floyd abrams. %$* 13
i want to close with a story and i hypothetical. %$* 204
suppose we had a situation in which a not for profit or for profit company made a movie denouncing a leading candidate for the presidency of the united states. %$* 204
suppose it were a crime for that movie to be shown on television, a crime for that to be shown on cable, a crime for it to be financed and shown in either of those places. %$* 204
that is what the citizens united case was about. %$* 204
those are the facts of the citizens united case. %$* 204
it was a not for profit. %$* 204
it could have been a for profit. %$* 204
that doesn't change what this is about. %$* 204
this is a situation in which once you say that, look, we'll leave it to congress to draw some lines, and they represent the people. %$* 204
congress after all is doing the people's work in a representative democracy. %$* 204
sometimes they are. %$* 204
the view of the first amendment of congress is congress is dangerous. %$* 204
congress is something we need protection against. %$* 204
congress is something we have to be really sure doesn't get involved with speech of anyone. %$* 204
and in this respect, speech includes not just individuals but institutions, labor unions, corporations or the like. %$* 204
so i would urge you that we have really a wonderfully representative audience here tonight. %$* 204
and it is very important that that audience focus on the underlying value of the first amendment. %$* 204
that value is keep the government out of speech areas. %$* 204
that's what the first amendment is about. %$* 204
and i urge to you vote yes on this proposition. %$* 204
thank you, floyd abrams. %$* 13
and to repeat the proposition, individuals and organizations have a constitutional right to unlimited spending on their own political speech. %$* 13
and here to summarize her position against this motion, zephyr teachout, a professor at fordham law school and former national director of the sunlight foundation. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 206
i urge to you oppose the proposition, and i'm also going to tell a story, but it's a much more recent story. %$* 206
i started running for governor in new york on the democratic party line about two months ago. %$* 206
and so i'm sitting in my office, and i have a staff of six. %$* 206
and some of our job is getting on the fundraising, and some of our job is talking to the press, but there's something that we talk about a lot. %$* 206
i happen to-- %$* 206
i was excited to hear you mention antitrust. %$* 206
i happen to care a lot about taking on the monopolies in our current system. %$* 206
so i am actively opposing the comcast merger. %$* 206
so because it is 2014 and not 1973, what we talk about is what the risk in my opposing that comcast merger means because of the potential millions of dollars that could be spent against my campaign, defaming me, telling all kinds of barely true things about me. %$* 206
so we sit in fear while we talk about that. %$* 206
and because it is not 1972, i'm not-- %$* 206
or i'm not jack kennedy, i have to worry about these things. %$* 206
i have to think about, "what is it that i could say that the koch brothers could spend unlimited money on? %$* 206
" i'd like to think it's not influencing me, but i will tell you it is hard for it not to influence you, it is hard not to say, "i'm just going to pick one target and not tell the truth about those other targets," because you can feel the potential power of those incredibly wealthy interests wanting to spend money to keep me quiet. %$* 206
so i have a commitment in the campaign, but i have an emotional experience right now of the effect of money in politics, and that's the thing the founders talked about is, "how do we make our representatives care about the public? %$* 206
and if we don't figure out the right relationship between money and power, we are moving towards an oligarchy, not a democracy, and that is the most unconstitutional thing we could move towards." %$* 206
thank you, zephyr teachout. %$* 13
and that concludes our closing statements. %$* 13
and now it's time to see which side you, our live audience here in philadelphia, feels has argued the best. %$* 13
we're going to ask you again-- %$* 13
we're going to ask you again to go to the keypads at your seats and to register your vote on this motion for the last time, "individuals and organizations have a constitutional right to unlimited spending on their own political speech." push number one if you agree with this motion, push number two if you disagree, and push number three if you became or remain undecided. %$* 13
i just need to repeat for the radio broadcast-- %$* 13
i just got a note-- %$* 13
i just need to repeat the text that i just read. %$* 13
i'm just going to do that quickly. %$* 13
and now it is time to learn which side has argued the best. %$* 13
we're going to ask you again to go to the keypad at your seat. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
it's back to you. %$* 13
so if you take the next 10 to 15 seconds to register your vote, and then we will lock it out. %$* 13
and while that's happening, i just want to say a couple of things. %$* 13
one is that about a week ago an email went around inside the offices of intelligence squared asking our staff members, several of whom are here tonight among you, for recommendations or our suggestions for staff favorite debates of the nearly 90-- %$* 13
the more than 90 debates we've done now. %$* 13
we wanted to put together a sort of "staff's picks list." i just wanted to say i think that this debate goes to number one in my list tonight. %$* 13
i think this-- %$* 13
what we saw here tonight was spectacular and so hits the ideals of what intelligence squared is about. %$* 13
really, really excellent. %$* 13
it was respectful. %$* 13
and it was intelligent. %$* 13
and it took the issues seriously. %$* 13
it took you as members of the audience seriously. %$* 13
and i also want to say that it's never happened before that every question from the audience was good. %$* 13
so i'm going to have to talk to the crowd back in new york about this. %$* 13
but thank you for everybody who asked a question. %$* 13
i also want to say that we would love it if you would tweet about this. %$* 13
our hashtag is "speech debate." our handles are at @iq2us and @constitutionctr. %$* 13
that's for "center." thank you also to jeffrey rosen and the national constitution center for inviting us here today. %$* 13
and some further thanks because this program was supported by the daniel berger esquire, programming fund and the snyder foundation for the national constitution center, our thank you to them as well, please. %$* 13
if you can get up to new york, it's a short train ride, our regularly scheduled fall senate starts at the kaufman center on september 9.we'll be briefly announcing all of our fall lineup topics soon, but here's a sneak peek at some of what we're looking at debating. %$* 13
right now we're working with these motions: "embrace the common core," "iraq is not worth saving," "income inequality impairs the american dream of upward mobility"-- %$* 13
"legalize assisted suicide," and the one we mentioned before, "genetically modify food."tickets will be available through our website, wwwiq2us.org. %$* 13
and if you can't join our live audience, there are other ways, as we've talked about. %$* 13
you can watch us live or on four.tv and you can listen to the debates on npr stations, which-- %$* 13
in philadelphia, as you know, is whyy 90.9 fm.and we have a mailing list. %$* 13
all of this you can get to by finding us on twitter and on our facebook. %$* 13
and we also actually welcome your feedback and topic ideas. %$* 13
and some of the debates that we're putting up in the fall actually came from members of the audience, and we're getting great ideas from all of you. %$* 13
thank you all for coming. %$* 13
and now, i think it's time to announce the final results. %$* 13
okay, so it's all in. %$* 13
you voted twice. %$* 13
and remember, the team whose numbers have changed the most between the first and the last vote will be declared our winners. %$* 13
our motion is this-- %$* 13
individuals and organizations have a constitutional right to unlimited spending on their own political speech. %$* 13
before the debate 33 percent of you agreed with this. %$* 13
49 percent were against. %$* 13
18 percent were undecided. %$* 13
those are the opening results. %$* 13
you voted again. %$* 13
now it's the team whose numbers have changed the most in the second vote. %$* 13
let's look at the second vote. %$* 13
the team arguing for the motion, in the second vote, 33 percent. %$* 13
they went from 33 percent straight across. %$* 13
they picked up no percentage points. %$* 13
zero is the number to beat. %$* 13
the team arguing against the motion, their first vote, 49 percent. %$* 13
second vote, 65 percent. %$* 13
they pulled up 16 percentage points. %$* 13
that's enough to make them a winner. %$* 13
the team arguing against the motion declared our winner, the motion defeated is this-- %$* 13
individuals and organizations have a constitutional right to unlimited spending on their own political speech. %$* 13
our congratulations to that side. %$* 13
thank you from me, john donvan and intelligence squared us. we'll see you next time. %$* 13

sometimes the market’s like a friendly labrador that kind of slobbers all over you and it’s very annoying, but you can’t somehow ignore it. %$* 170
i’m not denying, that the market is a combination of hundreds of things, be it greed, luck, research, a great eye, and i do know one great art dealer in germany, johann koenig, with only one eye, and he can only see about 10 percent with that eye, and he is one of the best dealers in the world. %$* 170
did i just argue against our side? %$* 170
this is the art world. %$* 170
it isn’t the art industry. %$* 170
they are appealing—and i like them, you know, i see them everywhere—to the cynical side of your nature. %$* 170
i’m being honest with you. %$* 170
the part that goes yeah, it’s all a dirty deal. %$* 170
and everybody’s bad, but let me tell you something. %$* 170
everybody isn’t bad, most people, and certainly %$* 170
they’re not, but that’s a different— art dealers, a lot of them are missing the same chromosome. %$* 170
you know? %$* 170
and it’s very annoying, but i—they create worlds %$* 170
and they pay the bills, they deal with artists, they deal with critics, they deal with collectors. %$* 170
they deal with plumbers, they do a lot. %$* 170
and if they don’t sell 10 shows in a row, they will close. %$* 170
there shouldn’t be regulation, there shouldn’t— and you complain because anyone can enter? %$* 170
i’m gonna be honest, i have no degrees at all. %$* 170
i am so lucky to be here, and i think about it all day every day. %$* 170
that i’m—you know how i got in the art world, i went like this. %$* 170
i’m in the art world. %$* 170
and they said, what are you, and i went, uh %$* 170
i’ll be a critic. %$* 170
and that’s how i did what i’m doing. %$* 170
we all are making this up out of ourselves, just like you. %$* 170
to be perfectly honest, we’re all learning on the job. %$* 170
everybody’s learning on the job, all the time, rules, you want to start the aec, no, no, no. %$* 170
i mean no offense, i love these people but i hate these ideas. %$* 170
sorry. %$* 170
we’re not talking about ethics, the art world is ethical, it’s not ethical, it’s this, it’s that, it doesn’t compare, it’s not a $15 billion bubble anywhere, for god’s sake, it’s not nuclear, secrets that are being leaked. %$* 170
yes, these guys do know how the secrets are done, and i love that they do, and i don’t even hate them for it, i think, fine, that’s part of it, that’s part of their game. %$* 170
but we’re not talking about ethics, we’re talking about—aesthetics. %$* 170
aesthetics is the type of thinking and judgment that we use in the art world, and yes. %$* 170
damien hirst’s skull cost $100 million, it was very publicly, that he was one of the owners of it. %$* 170
fine. %$* 170
whatever. %$* 170
but there’s also the lifestyles of the poor and famous. %$* 170
vito acconci right now is standing around going, uh, i still have no money. %$* 170
you know. %$* 170
adrian piper, i’m naming names you might not know. %$* 170
the point i guess i’m trying to make, is the art world will work the way it works, it’s time to rethink it. %$* 170
this is true. %$* 170
because, a lot of the ideas they’re talking about, and i don’t say this about them, but seem very, very yesterday. %$* 170
and a time long, long ago, and we were very lucky to have this very temporary bubble, where 1 percent of blah-blah-blah made money and that’s great. %$* 170
i want more artists to make more money, so they don’t have to have dark nights of the soul at their jobs for 40 hours. %$* 170
now they are. %$* 170
and so are you, and so are they, we’re gonna have to worry a little bit more. %$* 170
but %$* 170
i think you just have to let the art world be what it is. %$* 170
the rethinking of it has to be look at the huge white cubes that we now have. %$* 170
look, that they may not be enhancing the journeys to art, but may have become content in themselves. %$* 170
the same way that the talk about the market, hollows out art. %$* 170
it takes your eyes off the prize, the way amy and chuck were talking about, and you’re stuck talking about a red herring, something that to be perfectly honest, not one person this room, not them %$* 170
got into the art world to do. %$* 170
each one of them is here because they love art. %$* 170
so, peace and love. %$* 170
thank you, thank you, jerry saltz. %$* 13
that concludes the opening statements for our debate, can we have a round of applause for all of our panelists. %$* 13
when you all arrived for the debate we asked you to vote your opinion on our motion, and i’m gonna share the results with you now, to restate our motion, it is, “the art market is less ethical than the stock market.” you all voted before the debate and the results are very evenly split. %$* 13
32 percent agree with the motion, 30 percent disagree, and 38 percent are undecided. %$* 13
“4” means what? %$* 168
“4” means i came in late— %$* 13
those guys doing, we’re against the proposition— %$* 168
okay. %$* 32
this is the “for” side— %$* 13
right. %$* 168
—and that’s the “against” side— %$* 13
okay. %$* 32
and how— %$* 13
swing voters— %$* 168
the way that we will judge the winner at the end of the evening is we look at, whose numbers move by a larger percentage so the fact that it’s quite evenly split makes this a pretty good horserace at this point but— at the end of the evening we wanna see who actually has a larger number or who has dropped numbers. %$* 13
now we’re gonna move into the second section of the evening. %$* 13
and that’s where the debaters can talk directly to one another. %$* 13
you’ll be involved as audience members, i wanna remind all of you that the tone of this part of the debate can be quite informal, you don’t need me to be a traffic cop, i will only get involved and pull you back if there’s a terrible pile-on %$* 13
and everyone talking at once, but feel free to interrupt each other, to support each other, it’s your debate, this part of the evening. %$* 13
but i wanna start it off by asking michael hue-williams who heard the other side essentially argue that art is not like other stuff that can be regulated, it’s closer to love and you can’t regulate love or romance. %$* 13
what if you take the basic rule %$* 13
buyer beware, whatever happened to that rule and why does that simply not apply. %$* 13
why doesn’t that take care of all problems. %$* 13
that’s a good question. %$* 167
i’m not sure i know the answer to that. %$* 167
so i’m gonna %$* 167
say something completely different, i’m gonna say— %$* 167
you could be in politics with that. %$* 13
i’m— yeah, i’m not gonna answer the question at all, i’m gonna say that actually %$* 167
i wanted to agree with jerry. %$* 167
and i wanted to say that, he’s absolutely right, we’re all in this for the same reason. %$* 167
but actually tonight, we’re here to debate a very specific motion which has nothing to do with the fact  %$* 167
the fact that— %$* 167
oh. %$* 170
—that we are all involved with art because we love it and because it’s our lives and because we are not able to do anything else speaking from my own point of view. %$* 167
i had to invent a job for myself ‘cause nobody else would have me. %$* 167
but actually we’re here because we love art, because it drives us, because it thrills us and because, the exciting thing about the art world and the people that make it is that it is a %$* 167
i always think of it as a running race, where the great artists pass the baton from one to the other, and the really great artists get to carry it forward. %$* 167
and for me seeing those artists and— %$* 167
that’s very %$* 168
—trying to help them— %$* 167
fire. %$* 168
i’d like to— %$* 168
trying to help them go forward is a byproduct of what we do, and as a gallery, yes, we sell the work but also we sometimes have to help them create the work. %$* 167
but— %$* 168
and by the way, jerry, in case you didn’t realize, i look after vito acconci. %$* 167
and he’s a wonderful artist— %$* 170
but i’d just like to say— %$* 168
he’s doing wonderful things. %$* 167
michael, you sort of made a case in favor of regulation being something that, you know, normatively affects, that inspires ethical behavior, i mean i would like to know %$* 168
i do not think regulation ensures ethical behavior at all, certainly we’ve seen in the stock market that lots of regulation certainly doesn’t ensure ethical behavior, we can—violations are tremendous, in fact, this idea of the pressure of a common pool or the idea that everybody who’s part of the art world %$* 168
even part of the art market signs up for the full ethos here that you love, covet and take care of the art and in fact, if people in the art—you know, even the most highly compensated people in the art world, could make more if they chose a different profession, we all know that, so the reward system is obviously other as we’ve well-established here— %$* 168
i think that’s two really important points, first of all we’re not actually talking about money here. %$* 167
we’re talking about ethics. %$* 167
and, we’re talking about whether a market is ethical. %$* 167
not about whether people make lots of money or don’t make lots of money, we’re just talking about ethics. %$* 167
but does— %$* 170
does regulation— %$* 168
whether one market or another market is ethic— %$* 167
—ensure ethical behavior. %$* 168
and the other thing i think is really important to understand is that, i’m not asking for regulation in the market, i know that that won’t happen, and i, yes, okay, mea culpa, i am a cannibal, i am eating my own as it were, i’m jonathan swift’s modest proposal, i am suggesting that we eat our own children, through the market. %$* 167
but actually, i am a great devotee of the market, i think that its inconsistencies, like adam, are one of the great attractions of the market. %$* 167
and the fact that nothing is ever the same yesterday as it will be tomorrow is one of the extraordinary things about the art world. %$* 167
but to— %$* 170
jerry saltz— %$* 13
—say that the art market is inconsistent, i think every—that’s built into it. %$* 170
but inconsistent doesn’t ipso facto mean it’s unethical, from here down to there. %$* 170
of course there are going to be instances of people trying to manipulate any market to try to make money. %$* 170
you’re saying that it is an unethical thing, that is— %$* 170
no we’re not— %$* 167
—your argument— %$* 170
—we’re not—jerry, sorry, what we’re saying here, is that—and if you look at the debate motion again, we are saying that it is more unethical than the stock market, that’s what we’re debating— %$* 167
and it’s done more damage, is what you’re saying than the stock market— %$* 170
i’m not debating whether it’s done damage or not, i am simply debating the point, that— %$* 167
but then why be in it. %$* 170
because, because— %$* 165
richard feigen. %$* 13
richard feigen, please— %$* 13
why be in it— in all deference to jerry, the subject here is not the art world. %$* 165
which i happen not to particularly like because people make a— %$* 165
why. %$* 170
why not— %$* 165
why don’t you like the art world— %$* 170
—because people run around using it like they use fancy bentleys and things like that, i don’t— %$* 165
well, you drive that, they don’t drive it out there, i’m telling you— %$* 170
look, we’re talking about a market. %$* 165
a market is a financial vehicle. %$* 165
in all deference to chuck, i couldn’t agree more. %$* 165
but the subject here is not art. %$* 165
there is no— %$* 165
yes it is— %$* 170
—more passion— %$* 165
but the art market contains— %$* 168
no. %$* 165
there is— %$* 165
—many externalities— %$* 168
there is more passionate— %$* 165
many externalities— %$* 168
—there’s no one more passionate about art, thank you very much, than myself. %$* 165
and i’d much rather buy it— %$* 165
prove it. %$* 168
—than sell it. %$* 165
prove it? %$* 165
richard— %$* 166
ah, come on. %$* 165
you’re— %$* 166
chuck close— %$* 13
listen, everybody knows i’d rather be a collector than a dealer anyway, but the point is, that we’re talking about the art market. %$* 165
and the market, and i’m saying, that art has become a financial market. %$* 165
i don’t like it. %$* 165
it makes my life more difficult— %$* 165
but it’s been a financial market since the renaissance. %$* 170
let’s bring in chuck close— %$* 13
richard %$* 170
chuck close— %$* 13
yeah, you’re a second, primarily a second-market dealer, which means that you try to buy low and sell high, or like a real estate agent, you take things on commission and you hope to sell ‘em and collect a commission on that sale. %$* 166
that’s really not some— that’s to me not a very important relationship to the art world. %$* 166
certainly not to— not to artists, i mean you’re— you might be-- %$* 166
it’s for dead artists or estates, but i’d like to talk about what i think is a real ethical bond between the primary art dealer, who represents artists, who believe in that artist, who take a risk on that artist, and put that work out there, and make that work available. %$* 166
i was a kid from a mill town in the state of washington, i couldn’t believe when i got to new york and there was this incredible smorgasbord of art for me to look at, that was given to me free of charge by galleries. %$* 166
i could go in, i could look at this work, i was never gonna buy this stuff. %$* 166
this is a real service that the dealer provides. %$* 166
and they make that artist’s work available to collectors, and there are-- %$* 166
at first i didn’t wanna meet a collector of mine ‘cause what if he or she was a jerk, and then i’d say oh my god, that jerk owns my work. %$* 166
so i tried not to meet them. %$* 166
and then i found out that really truly wonderful people out there buy art. %$* 166
and they give it to museums. %$* 166
and they make it available to other people, if it weren’t for really philanthropic people who are a real asset to the art world, and this commerce that goes back and forth, it—there are people who are speculators. %$* 166
i mean i was first an advisor to charles saatchi when he was first buying art, i told him which pieces by which artists he oughta buy. %$* 166
and he bought one of my pieces. %$* 166
i knew right away never to sell another work of art to this guy. %$* 166
i knew he was a speculator, he was gonna make—he liked to make and destroy careers. %$* 166
and— %$* 166
chuck, are you switching to the other side of the argument— %$* 13
no, i’m—no. %$* 166
i’m not, i’m talking about the primary role that a gallery plays in an artist’s career, putting that work forward, and the responsibility, i hate to see them slammed. %$* 166
i hate to see them talked about as if they were selling hog futures. %$* 166
it’s another kind of business. %$* 166
and we, those of us who make art, we appreciate the truly wonderful collectors who are out there. %$* 166
where would museums be without collectors giving their work to these museums. %$* 166
this is a wonderful part of how the art world works. %$* 166
chuck, your art— %$* 165
it’s not %$* 166
even the trading’s— %$* 168
let me just, pause— %$* 13
—you’re on a waiting list— %$* 165
let me pause the debate for a minute, i just wanna start the process of taking audience questions and then you can resume that moment. %$* 13
i just wanna see if any hands are up, because we bring up the lights. %$* 13
and also i wanna remind you that we’re delighted to hear from you—i feel you’re sitting on your hands a little bit tonight, feel free to speak out. %$* 13
so, we have a question down here on the front row, and if we move the mic down we’ll come to you in just a second, sir, as we continue the conversation. %$* 13
richard feigen. %$* 13
you were about to speak. %$* 13
well, chuck, you are one of those important contemporary artists whose work sells in the seven figures and there’s a waiting list for it. %$* 165
imagine, some kid who can’t get a gallery, where the rents are so high that the gallery can’t even show the work. %$* 165
i tried, i represented artists in the primary market— %$* 165
believe me, i know more of them than— %$* 166
let— %$* 165
—you know. %$* 166
chuck, let me tell you, i tried it, and i’m no good at promotion. %$* 165
the touting, and all that publicity, and the politics, that go into making an artist successful. %$* 165
so i ran around feeling responsible, and guilty. %$* 165
all right, because i couldn’t do it, i don’t know how to do it. %$* 165
there— %$* 165
that’s not why you didn’t do it. %$* 170
jerry saltz— %$* 13
the reason you didn’t do it is because you had a gift for what you are doing, you’re not involved with the contemporary art world because it wasn’t the first language that you really were made to speak— %$* 170
jerry, i showed contemporary artists in chicago when— %$* 165
i worked for you, when i was, 21. %$* 170
i’m telling you— %$* 165
on michigan avenue, i was there. %$* 170
well, right, look— %$* 165
620 michigan— %$* 170
right now it’s all about— it’s the charles saatchis feeding into— %$* 165
no, it isn’t— %$* 170
—only about that— %$* 170
—into the auction houses— %$* 165
you’re only— %$* 170
the whole thing is about touting— %$* 165
—looking at one tiny, tiny, tiny sliver of it, and saying that’s the whole thing, from top to bottom, that it’s the core, so it’s become that for you guys. %$* 170
i didn’t say top to bottom— %$* 165
even in the auction house it’s not that way, i mean even sitting in it it’s not that way. %$* 168
we— %$* 168
auction houses won’t take anything for sale unless it costs a certain huge sum of money, they won’t even accept in an auction. %$* 165
adam, adam lindemann, you said, adam, that— %$* 13
i don’t think that’s true— %$* 169
we sell things all day for— %$* 168
adam— %$* 13
—a thousand dollars— %$* 168
adam lindemann argued that the market is ripe for unethical behavior, but you didn’t really gauge whether you think there is a lot of unethical behavior going on, you didn’t say one way or the other. %$* 13
and it seems to me relevant to this topic whether we’re talking about a few bad apples or are we talking about large-scale unethical behavior, and i wanna ask your side if it’s a few bad apples then we’re not talking about a huge problem. %$* 13
but is it bigger than that. %$* 13
it seems to me that, the question becomes, you know, is the proposition correct, in a systemic definition, or is it correct in practice. %$* 169
meaning, is the system that is the art market, the unregulated art market inherently more open to unethical behavior— %$* 169
and you argued that it was— %$* 13
—than a regulated market. %$* 169
now your question is, in practice— %$* 169
right. %$* 13
—is the art market actually unethical. %$* 169
and i have tremendous respect for the other side here. %$* 169
speaking of ethics i think that had i chosen the other side, i wouldn’t have made the panel because they had more people on that side than this one. %$* 169
so i sensed that there was a spot for me over here. %$* 169
and i’m arguing this side %$* 169
which has a lot to do about art and the art market, you know— %$* 169
—you have to feel your way through. %$* 169
that being said, i—the people that i deal with are the people that i think are ethical, i choose people that i have a relationship with %$* 169
that are either my friends or i have a good feeling about them, and do things happen, of course, everything happens— %$* 169
right— %$* 13
—in this world anything can happen. %$* 169
that being said, our side has definitely-- %$* 169
you know, we’re going downhill here in the sense that we don’t have any rules in the art market %$* 169
whereas the public is protected by the sec as we were saying, perhaps imperfectly so but that’s the effort, the public can enjoy the art world that jerry saltz has laid out for us and certainly should support the art world that chuck close has laid out for us and, and i do feel very strongly that way. %$* 169
nonetheless, there are no rules, there’s no inherent value, i mean, the other side literally said, let me see here. %$* 169
artists %$* 169
where is it, “there is no intrinsic value, only extrinsic value,” that’s chuck close’s words so, if there is no intrinsic value, then %$* 169
it’s ripe for unethical behavior. %$* 169
let me turn to your teammate, michael hue-williams, and michael, if you can approach your microphone a little bit, i got a signal that the radio’s having a little bit of difficulty because of the distance. %$* 13
are there a lot of unethical players in the art market or only a few. %$* 13
i’m— %$* 167
or do you not know because nobody knows. %$* 13
i’m sure there may be but i’m sure i don’t know them. %$* 167
i think your question is an interesting one but it actually has no bearing on the motion that we’re discussing here. %$* 167
because this motion is a purely hypothetical motion, so, i’m gonna bring this back, and i’m going to agree with— %$* 167
you really don’t like to answer direct questions, do you. %$* 13
now i’m completely lost. %$* 167
i think that the art market is open for manipulation because it’s unregulated, i think it is unregulated because, historically, it’s found its own way of operating because it’s just simply not possible to regulate this market, and it would be a ghastly thing, if it ever could be regulated. %$* 167
a lot of the excitement and fun would go out of it. %$* 167
so to answer your question, do i know a lot of bad apples in the art market, no. %$* 167
but the art market, when we have instances of things going wrong and manipulations and unethical behavior, attracts a huge amount of attention, a disproportionate amount of attention because the art market is very exciting, it is very well-reported, it always has been, because, it is also the cradle of— it’s an expression of humanity, it’s an expression of something that is above the humdrum essence of daily life, it’s something that when it is truly great, it takes us into another realm, into a realm that hopefully, will have cultural credibility for years and decades and centuries to come. %$* 167
let’s take a question from the front row, sir. %$* 13
well, we’ve heard tonight that the artist and the primary dealer are the foundation of the art market along with the collector. %$* 9
but we haven’t %$* 9
and we’ve heard how, secondary dealers and groups of collectors can manipulate the market. %$* 9
but i’m wondering how does the art critic fit into this. %$* 9
do the clement greenburgs of the world manipulate the art market, the jerry saltzes of the world? %$* 9
where does the critic, critic fit. %$* 9
that’s a really good question, i think we’re really, once upon a time the clement greenburgs of the art world, did, and they were able to manipulate taste. %$* 170
and therefore the market. %$* 170
that time luckily is long, long gone. %$* 170
and that now, i can like this, another critic can like that, michael wilson can like this, i’m looking at art critics in the room— and it really, we don’t have that kind of sway. %$* 170
i can say that damien hirst’s recent paintings were absolutely generic, fortieth-generation photorealist paintings %$* 170
which i did write. %$* 170
and you know how many he sold? %$* 170
all of them. %$* 170
i’ve done that a lot, and just to show you the other side, oh, well, he’s just saying, he’s being %$* 170
i’ve written that certain young artists are very, very good. %$* 170
and it doesn’t do, it won’t do anything. %$* 170
it has to be there. %$* 170
i don’t know what it is. %$* 170
you know, if you know, let me know. %$* 170
okay, we’re taking questions from the audience. %$* 13
i’m john donvan. %$* 13
but can i go another direction with that? %$* 167
all right, let me, i just need to do this little piece of radio and then i’ll come right to you, michael. %$* 13
i’m john donvan, your host and moderator, and this is intelligence squared u.s., oxford-style debating. %$* 13
we have six panelists, three for and three against this proposition: the art market is less ethical than the stock market. %$* 13
we’re returning to our debate with michael hue- williams. %$* 13
i just wanted to take you in a slightly different direction. %$* 167
if you go back nearly a hundred years and you think of, not an art critic but a very influential art historian-- %$* 167
bernard berenson, who was in cahoots with duveen – here you have an incredibly powerful manipulation which subsequently many other art historians have found to be entirely unethical and which museologists and museum directors have had to unravel as a result of the collusion between joseph duveen and bernard berenson. %$* 167
so, i'm just pointing that out as a, a fascinating manipulation of the market from an art historical point of view. %$* 167
take a question in the back. %$* 13
and i just want to bring a microphone down to the front to be ready. %$* 13
good. %$* 13
i’d like to address the question to the three people on the right side – that is, against the motion. %$* 9
mr. %$* 9
feigen and mr. %$* 9
hue- williams made a number of quite specific assertions about the way auctions are manipulated and conducted and the way auction houses behave. %$* 9
and none of the three of you responded directly to those assertions. %$* 9
could i ask you to do so? %$* 9
i suppose i should take that one first, as the auction house person on this panel. %$* 168
amy cappellazzo. %$* 13
first i would like to say, the only area of the art world that is regulated is the auction business, funny enough. %$* 168
so the assertion on this side that the auction business that those – even mr. %$* 168
rosenkranz in his comments in the beginning brought up the auction houses as somehow being involved in something not entirely transparent or understandable. %$* 168
the truth is, it’s the only area that’s regulated and in fact, the entire market is byzantine. %$* 168
and the only little glimmer of transparency comes when you watch a live auction and watch something trade in real time. %$* 168
so you can sort of understand the depth of market, how many people might be bidding. %$* 168
you might not know who is bidding or what exactly is going on but you might count those one, two, three, four telephones on that or what’s going on. %$* 168
i mean, certainly i don’t think everything you’re hearing on this panel, while they’re saying part of what makes the art market susceptible to corrupt, to unethical behavior is the fact that it’s unregulated, nobody on this panel would cry for regulation. %$* 168
that would just be a-- %$* 168
it’s too small a market to care, in most ca-- %$* 168
i think that’s really why we’re not regulated. %$* 168
but also just from a sort of a new york would they, christie’s would simply transfer me to london or paris – cities that would make sure there was no regulation and i would be relocated over there and new york would have no real trading floor by which to operate that way. %$* 168
wasn’t that the claim when the question – probably before amy, before you were born. %$* 165
but i remember back in the – %$* 165
richard feigen. %$* 13
was it the sixties or seventies? %$* 165
when the issue was brought up about chandelier bidding. %$* 165
right. %$* 168
okay? %$* 165
and they threatened, the auction houses threatened to leave new york city if they passed any regulation against this phantom bidding, which is designed to make people think there’s a competitor when there isn’t one. %$* 165
just so you know, for the purpose of the audience, i will explain what chandelier bidding is, which is the auctioneer is allowed to bid on behalf of the seller up to the reserve price. %$* 168
so the point of an auction is that sort of canter and lively chatter that goes on where he goes, one hundred, one hundred fifty, two hundred, two hundred and fifty. %$* 168
and you have to get a little momentum going. %$* 168
you can’t say, we’re opening the bidding at six hundred. %$* 168
anyone? %$* 168
no, no bid? %$* 168
boom, it’s over. %$* 168
so the auctioneer is allowed to bid on behalf of the seller and take bids, whether they exist or not, until they get close to the reserved price. %$* 168
that’s part of the dance of the auction, part of the momentum, part of the theatre that goes into it. %$* 168
that’s what i talking about, that it was theatre. %$* 165
right. %$* 168
and what i said, if i want theatre i’ll go down either to off- broadway or broadway. %$* 165
right, you’ll go to broadway and you’ll have a little theatre. %$* 168
i get it, right. %$* 168
exactly. %$* 168
beautiful. %$* 168
you’ll have a little theatre that way. %$* 168
you know, the— %$* 168
but what-- %$* 165
the auction is an ancient form. %$* 168
it’s not something we invented in this format. %$* 168
it’s been around for thousands of years and-- %$* 168
i don’t think that the chandelier bidding existed in the early years, when i started out. %$* 165
all i know is what-- %$* 165
they also didn’t print estimates and it was entirely dealers in the room. %$* 168
so-- %$* 168
but, amy, when a new buyer comes along and he doesn’t have the knowledge of the market or of values, he goes to auction and why? %$* 165
because it gives him a measure of value. %$* 165
now, he goes in there and he bids. %$* 165
if he thought that his bid could not get the object because the reserve is higher and the bidding was fake, he wouldn’t bid. %$* 165
but they-- %$* 165
but what’s a-- %$* 168
but they make him think, because they say, oh, there’s a bid over there, there’s a bid over there, there’s a bid on the telephone. %$* 165
look-- %$* 168
all this is your drama. %$* 165
all this is your theatre. %$* 165
but the fact is, it is meant to deceive that buyer into thinking he has a competitor when he really doesn’t. %$* 165
and so-- %$* 165
look-- %$* 168
if all – %$* 165
the rules – %$* 168
what? %$* 165
listen, i’m not sure i can take on auction as a format. %$* 168
it’s an ancient method of selling and it’s really – you know, i’m not sure someone walks into feigen gallery and has a fabulous experience of transparency when they’re told what the price is on something. %$* 168
or, in the case of auction there’s a printed estimate. %$* 168
there’s sort of a lively public discussion about why that might be the estimate. %$* 168
there’s a lot of people that novice collector can go ask and find out why the estimate is this. %$* 168
there’s all sorts of databases they can search. %$* 168
there’s a lot of self-education someone can do on their own behalf. %$* 168
are you telling me that he shouldn’t bid until he gets up to the low end of the estimate? %$* 165
i’m telling, i would tell him all the time what the strategy is. %$* 168
the auctioneer can take bids to get the sort of rhythm going until he hits the reserve price. %$* 168
chuck close. %$* 13
the reserve price can be at the low estimate or lower. %$* 168
chuck close. %$* 13
if you want it, be ready. %$* 168
my prob. %$* 166
anyone that knows me knows i’m not a big fan of auction houses. %$* 166
i’m sorry, amy. %$* 166
but not for these reasons and not for the reasons that are part of that kind of arcane business, practice that i don’t think very many of us know or care about. %$* 166
what bothers me is that all an auction price means is that there were two people there that night who thought that that’s what it was worth. %$* 166
and that’s what’s destructive in the art world, because a dealer will look at the artist’s career and know that he or she cannot ask the most they can possibly ask for that painting that day because it’s gonna screw up that artist’s career for years to come. %$* 166
you don’t-- %$* 166
look, a work of art is only worth what someone can ask for it until it resells. %$* 168
then you know what it’s really worth. %$* 168
no, you don’t know what it’s really worth. %$* 166
you know that two-- %$* 166
from a financial standpoint, from a modern kind of standpoint – %$* 168
you know that two people that night thought that that was what it was worth. %$* 166
look, these are thinly traded markets. %$* 168
but so are the markets for commercial real estate, nuclear reactors, rocket ships. %$* 168
a dealer will not, a dealer will not put a work out-- %$* 166
these are also thinly traded artists. %$* 168
we’re going to go to another question from the audience. %$* 13
sir. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 9
and remember to hold that mic pretty close. %$* 13
that’s good. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 9
to return to the question itself, it seems self-evident that because of the absence or the limited amount of regulation that the potential as opposed to the practice in the art market is far greater for unethical behavior, as adam lindemann was pointing out. %$* 9
so i think that the answer hinges more on what sorts of people are drawn into the art market as opposed to the stock market. %$* 9
and jerry saltz said something very interesting earlier about how he thought that the people in the market might be missing a chromosome, the same chromosome. %$* 9

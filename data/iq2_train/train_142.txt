throughout the evening, because we're broadcasting for radio, i'll be doing a number of formal repetitions of particular phrases that's might become tiresome to you. %$* 13
but just so you know, i'll be telling you again and again what my name is, for example, when we come back from breaks and in a couple situations i may ask you to break spontaneously into applause to come back from a break. %$* 13
so you'll know that it's spontaneous because i've told you to do so. %$* 13
i would like to introduce with great respect and appreciation the founder of intelligence squared u.s.who has made all of this possible and who will be framing the debate for us tonight, mr. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
well, thank you very much, and thank you for joining us this evening. %$* 1
now, i have a day job, and it's running an insurance company. %$* 1
we cover some 8 percent of the u.s. work force for long-term disability and serious workplace injuries. %$* 1
so we see, first hand, that obesity is a major factor in driving claims costs, particularly those related to serious traumatic injuries. %$* 1
the most obese have substantially higher incident rates of diabetes and chronic heart disease as well. %$* 1
but does this necessarily mean that lower weight produces better health outcomes for everyone? %$* 1
do the moderately overweight need to go on crash diets or otherwise modify their eating habits? %$* 1
when the government defines terms like "overweight" and "obese," do those particular weight levels have any demonstrable connection with health outcomes? %$* 1
the first lady has made childhood obesity her signature issue. %$* 1
but interestingly, the administration does not want to join the debate tonight. %$* 1
we're disappointed that the current surgeon general was required to withdraw from the debate, but delighted that her predecessor, david satcher is with us. %$* 1
he was actually the first to sound the alarm over obesity. %$* 1
so this brings me to the crux of tonight's debate. %$* 1
if obesity is indeed a serious public health issue, what, if anything, should the government do about it? %$* 1
well, at a minimum, it can stop doing harm. %$* 1
farm subsidies are targeted at producers of corn syrup and beef, for example, but not at producers of fruits and vegetables. %$* 1
school lunch programs are festooned with regulations that fly in the face of nutritional common sense. %$* 1
aside from its sins of commission, can the government actively make things better? %$* 1
should we embrace ideas from britain to treat parents of obese children as abusive or neglectful and then haul them into court? %$* 1
do calorie disclosures and requirements for healthy menu choices really change eating habits? %$* 1
indeed, are there any government obesity programs that in fact produce measurable health benefits in a cost effective way? %$* 1
as usual, the issues tonight are complex. %$* 1
fortunately, we have some outstanding panelists to shed light on them. %$* 1
and it's my pleasure to turn the evening over to them and to our moderator, john donvan. %$* 1
thank you. %$* 1
thank you. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
and i'd just like to invite one more round of applause for robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
yes or no to this statement: obesity is the government's business. %$* 13
we all eat, but do we do it wisely and well? %$* 13
well, obviously not. %$* 13
so who is supposed to fix that? %$* 13
well, that's what we're going to have out here tonight. %$* 13
this is another debate from intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four superbly qualified debaters, two teams of two, who are ready to get started. %$* 13
we'll have three rounds of debate, and then the audience will vote to choose the winner, and only one side wins. %$* 13
and as we go into it and meet our debaters, ponder this thought: at one point in our history, the surgeon of the general of the united states raised the alarm about the number of americans who were underweight. %$* 13
that was dr. %$* 13
hugh cumming. %$* 13
he was the sixth surgeon general, and it was 1925.and he certainly thought it was the government's business that americans were getting too few calories. %$* 13
so what happened? %$* 13
how did we get to this world where americans are getting too many calories? %$* 13
our motion is, "obesity is the government's business." and arguing for this motion, i'd like to introduce this team first, first dr. %$* 13
david satcher, who is the 16th surgeon general of the united states. %$* 13
and dr. %$* 13
satcher, you were the first to raise the alarm in 2001 about the obesity epidemic. %$* 13
and i want to just ask you very briefly, at that point, did you see us reaching this point where the numbers are where they are today? %$* 13
well, it was sort of a surprise when we saw what had happened over a 20-year period and the direction that we were going in terms of increasing obesity. %$* 414
so we didn't know how long it would take to begin to turn what we call the epidemic around. %$* 414
thank you, dr. %$* 13
david satcher. %$* 13
and your teammate, dr. %$* 13
pamela peeke, you started out life as a critical care doctor, and then you went back to school to learn nutrition. %$* 13
motivated by what? %$* 13
i became a pew foundation scholar in nutrition and metabolism because in medical school, i learned nothing. %$* 415
i didn't have a minute of nutrition taught to me. %$* 415
yet here i was in the critical care unit where people-- %$* 415
where people's lives were at stake. %$* 415
i had to keep them alive with food. %$* 415
and i was the most clueless person of all. %$* 415
i went back to school. %$* 415
thank you. %$* 13
and welcome to our team arguing for the motion. %$* 13
our team arguing against the motion that obesity is the government's business includes paul campos. %$* 13
he is a modern-day version of the renaissance man. %$* 13
he is a shakespeare scholar, a law professor. %$* 13
he's at the university of colorado as well as a practicing attorney in certain times. %$* 13
but you're here because of a book you wrote called, "the obesity myth" in the mid-2000s, which was motivated, you've said before, by an interesting confluence of events, the monica lewinsky scandal and the use of the word zaftig in the public culture to describe her, all of which led you into a new field. %$* 13
how? %$* 13
yeah, i was a-- %$* 416
sounds improbable, but i was a-- %$* 416
i was doing a conference on the clinton impeachment when it was taking place, and a speaker dropped out on me, and i had to fill in the gap in the program. %$* 416
and so i was looking at the media coverage of the clinton impeachment to see if there was something interesting to say about it. %$* 416
and i did a lexis search, and i found that there were more than 100 news stories that used the phrase "monica lewinsky" and the word "zaftig." and i was very struck by that, because, of course, as i have discovered in talking about this over the years, the vast majority of americans don't know what zaftig means. %$* 416
this audience probably has a relatively high percentage of people who know what that word means. %$* 416
but most americans don't. %$* 416
and yet monica lewinsky was being identified as both fat and jewish, which i thought was kind of interesting by the use of that word. %$* 416
and so i started looking at the weight that-- %$* 416
the role that weight obsessionalism played in the clinton impeachment. %$* 416
and here we are today. %$* 416
thank you. %$* 13
and your-- %$* 13
your teammate, john stossel, john stossel, well known as a journalist, a gadfly, a libertarian, a contrarian and omnivore, i presume. %$* 13
a what? %$* 288
yes, yes. %$* 288
omna. %$* 288
that might have been too personal. %$* 13
relevant to this debate, john, you have likened those who would want to regulate the diet of americans to the prohibitionists of the early 20th century, the moral being what? %$* 13
that they mean well, but that they do more harm than good. %$* 288
all right. %$* 13
and it reminds me of what mencken said, that they have the haunting fear that someone somewhere may be happy. %$* 288
ladies and gentlemen, the team arguing against the motion. %$* 13
so our motion is obesity is the government's business, and this is a debate. %$* 13
it's a contest. %$* 13
at the end, there will be a winner and a loser. %$* 13
and you, our live audience here at the skirball center, will choose the winner. %$* 13
by the time the evening has ended, we will have asked you to vote twice; once before the debate and once again at the end. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers have changed the most will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so let's go to the preliminary vote. %$* 13
if you go to the keypad at your seat, our motion is, "obesity is the government's business." if you agree with the motion, push number 1. and if you disagree, push number 2. %$* 13
and if you're undecided, push number 3.ignore the other keys. %$* 13
and if you push the wrong button, just correct yourself, and the system will lock you in. %$* 13
and what we're going to do is we're going to hold the result that we just registered to the end of the debate. %$* 13
we'll release the two numbers together, the starting number and then the concluding number. %$* 13
and as i said, we go in three rounds. %$* 13
so onto round one. %$* 13
our motion is "obesity if the government's business." in round 1, the speakers speak uninterrupted for seven minutes each. %$* 13
and speaking first for the motion, "obesity if the government's business," i'd like to introduce the 16th surgeon general of the united states. %$* 13
he has also served as assistant secretary of health and as director of the centers for disease control and prevention, dr. %$* 13
david satcher. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 414
well, we contend that obesity is definitely the government's business. %$* 414
my favorite story i think about policymakers is a story about a man who was traveling across the country in a hot air balloon, and at a certain point he realized that he was lost, he had no idea where he was, so he decided that he would lower the balloons and see if he could see some recognizable landmarks. %$* 414
so he lowered the balloon, couldn't see anything that he recognized, no golden gate bridge, no washington monument, so he had no idea where he was. %$* 414
so he kept lowering the balloon, and when he got to about 30 feet above ground he saw a man working in the field. %$* 414
so he yelled out, "where am i? %$* 414
" and the man stopped digging in the field, and he said, "well, you're in a hot air balloon about 30 feet above ground." the man in the balloon said, "you sound like a scientist. %$* 414
do you work in science? %$* 414
" and the man on the ground said, "my goodness, i am a scientist. %$* 414
but how in the world did you know that? %$* 414
" said, "well, i knew that because what you told me is technically correct but it is of absolutely no use to me right now." well, not to be outdone, the man on the ground said, "well, you sound like one of those policymakers from washington or somewhere." and the man in the balloon said, "i am. %$* 414
i'm an outstanding policymaker. %$* 414
i'm a leader. %$* 414
but how did you know that? %$* 414
" and the man on the ground said, "i knew that because you're in the same position you were when we met, you don't know where you are, you don't know where you're going, and now you're blaming me." well, let me say that i spent nine years in government, five as director of the cdc, and as you've heard, four as surgeon general and assistant secretary for health, and i have to tell you, i would trade nothing for those nine years. %$* 414
they were rich years. %$* 414
the people with whom i worked were special. %$* 414
so i am very excited about the role of government in dealing with a problem like obesity. %$* 414
let me just say a few of the things i was involved in. %$* 414
in 1996, while director of cdc, we released a very interesting report on physical activity. %$* 414
it was actually released as a surgeon general's report, and basically what we showed in that report on physical activity was that there was a dramatic decline in physical activity among the american people, including schools no longer requiring physical education, k through 12. and so we expressed a lot of concerns about the sedentary lifestyles of american people and the implications of that. %$* 414
in 1999, i represented the united states at a world conference on health promotion and disease prevention. %$* 414
and at that conference for the first time i released the surgeon general's prescription which i'm sure many of you are familiar with, but among the things on that prescription was the recommendation for regular physical activity, at least 30 minutes a day, at least five days a week, but also a recommendation that the american people consume at least five servings of fruits and vegetables per day. %$* 414
there were other things on the prescription, even one having to do with mental health and the need to have some planned strategy for dealing with stress. %$* 414
we didn't really understand at that time the relationship between things like physical activity and depression, the fact that physical activity is a major intervention for reducing depression. %$* 414
then in 2001, as surgeon general and assistant secretary for health, i released the surgeon general's call to action to prevent and reduce overweight and obesity. %$* 414
that report, among other things, pointed out that between 1980 and the year 2000 there had been a tripling of overweight and obesity among children in this country and a doubling among adults. %$* 414
so we did sound the alarm, and even though i was former director of the cdc and we are very selective at what we call "epidemics," usually reserved for infectious diseases, we declared that overweight and obesity was an epidemic in this country. %$* 414
we didn't realize at that time that the same thing was beginning to happen all over the world. %$* 414
in that report of the surgeon general on overweight and obesity, we especially expressed concern about the changes in the maps throughout the country, where you could actually map the increase in overweight and obesity in various states, whereas in 1990, 15 percent was almost the high. %$* 414
by the year 2001, it was 25 to 30 percent of the american people who were obese. %$* 414
what we know about overweight and obesity from a population perspective is very important, i think, to this debate because what we know is that it has increased dramatically, but also that it is clearly associated with an increase in chronic diseases, especially what we call type ii diabetes, or increases in what we call bmi, the way we measure body fat, directly related to an increase in type ii diabetes. %$* 414
and, as you know, type ii diabetes increases the risk for cardiovascular disease and even renal disease. %$* 414
so we were concerned about what was happening in this country. %$* 414
we were concerned about the implication of these rising rates of overweight and obesity. %$* 414
we were also concerned about disparities. %$* 414
we have declared the goal of eliminating disparities in health in this country, especially among different racial and ethnic groups. %$* 414
and what we observed, of course, was that this epidemic was disproportionately impacting african americans and american indians. %$* 414
so, american indians also have the highest rate of type ii diabetes. %$* 414
and african americans have the highest mortality rates from type ii diabetes. %$* 414
so we were very concerned about the impact that this was having on eliminating disparities in health. %$* 414
we were also concerned about what was happening in children. %$* 414
i think this was really critical. %$* 414
what we found was that children, by increasing overweight and obesity, were now getting what we previously had called adult-onset diabetes. %$* 414
we were seeing it in children. %$* 414
we were seeing hypertension in children. %$* 414
pediatricians were expressing great concerns. %$* 414
thank you. %$* 414
dr. %$* 13
david satcher, your time is up. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 414
our motion is "obesity is the government’s business.” and here to speak against this motion, john stossel. %$* 13
he is host of the fox business network program, known as stossel. %$* 13
he has received 19 emmy awards. %$* 13
and prior to joining fox, he spent over two decades at 20/20 on abc news as an anchor and a correspondent. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, john stossel. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 288
i apologize for holding my hand up. %$* 288
i had hand surgery, and the doctor’s tell me hold it up so it doesn’t get inflamed, so i’m not saluting or doing anything weird like that. %$* 288
so, dr. %$* 288
satcher, i hear you and it’s a problem that people have less physical activity. %$* 288
and it would be good if we ate more fruits and vegetables. %$* 288
and it’s terrible that more people have diabetes, but obesity is the government’s business-- %$* 288
that’s a separate issue. %$* 288
it’s a powerful assumption in that, but behind it is the assumption that everything good should be encouraged by government and everything bad discouraged. %$* 288
and at first that sounds like common sense, but everything is arguably, to some degree, helpful or harmful. %$* 288
so, this is a formula for totalitarianism. %$* 288
i mean, why is totalitarianism if not the view that everything falls within the purview of the state? %$* 288
mussolini said that-- %$* 288
“everything within the state, nothing outside.” okay, that’s over the top. %$* 288
i’m not saying that government is like a fascist regime, but it’s becoming just as invasive. %$* 288
it spent $3.8 trillion. %$* 288
it’s going broke. %$* 288
the philosopher thomas hobbes started using the term “leviathan” to refer to a powerful central government to which we give up some rights. %$* 288
and he thought leviathan was a good thing. %$* 288
but he assumed that its function was protecting us from violence. %$* 288
he never imagined that leviathan would plan our meals. %$* 288
and the founders of this country never imagined that. %$* 288
they started the country with this. %$* 288
this is the constitution and the declaration of independence. %$* 288
together it’s this thin. %$* 288
this is what they thought we needed, and this is what made america prosperous. %$* 288
now, this isn’t everything we should have. %$* 288
we need pollution control rules. %$* 288
they didn’t think about that. %$* 288
but government has gone much further. %$* 288
we now have an agriculture department that spends $145 billion a year. %$* 288
government runs public housing, a war on drugs, a welfare state. %$* 288
it subsidizes farmers and, by doing that, does harm, as robert rosenkrantz said, making people fatter. %$* 288
it runs school lunches. %$* 288
it subsidizes students, indians, researchers, volunteers, small businessmen, rich businessmen, polices the world and polices our home and our jobs, our bedrooms. %$* 288
and now food too? %$* 288
well, yes. %$* 288
but if it weren't already doing all-- %$* 288
trying to do all that stuff and doing it badly, it could better do what it's supposed to, protect us from criminals and terrorists. %$* 288
and america wouldn't be going broke. %$* 288
but look, i have lost that argument. %$* 288
we libertarians have argued that we're in the minority. %$* 288
i understand that. %$* 288
most of you disagree. %$* 288
most of you want more government. %$* 288
you like the minimum wage. %$* 288
you like the eeoc to protect us against discrimination, title 9 to protect us against gender discrimination, rules against sexual harassment language being used in workplaces, the ada to protect disabled people, laws against prostitution and online gambling. %$* 288
and in the name of health and safety, you support laws requiring motorcycle helmets and osha to protect the workers, and the cspc to protect kids from dangerous toys, and the whole alphabet soup of agencies that keep growing in washington. %$* 288
and my debate partner, paul, he agrees with that. %$* 288
he says government ought to intervene in these areas. %$* 288
but even he says not obesity, because obesity is different, and government sucks at dealing with it. %$* 288
but he's the obesity expert. %$* 288
i'll let him explain that. %$* 288
all i know is that government keeps growing, and that is dangerous to our freedom. %$* 288
now the president wants to spend another 300 million or so of your dollars to pay for his wife's healthy foods financing initiative. %$* 288
and of course, that's in addition to all the stuff we already have, the "let's move" campaign, the task force on childhood obesity, the school lunch program, the council on fitness and so on. %$* 288
what's the result of all that stuff? %$* 288
since they created it, they spent a lot of your money on it, people are fatter than ever. %$* 288
and that's just what the feds spend. %$* 288
the states and localities spend even more. %$* 288
i mean, new york city now bans bake sales in schools. %$* 288
how much has that helped? %$* 288
my colleague, mike huckabee when he was governor of arkansas, he required every school to measure every kid's body mass index. %$* 288
dr. %$* 288
satcher mentioned that. %$* 288
it's a measure based on the height-weight ratio. %$* 288
it's a terrible measure. %$* 288
i mean, bmi index says that george clooney and tom cruise are overweight and arnold schwarzenegger is obese. %$* 288
it just mismeasures people, but it's required now in arkansas. %$* 288
for every kid, they get a report card that doesn't just give their arithmetic score. %$* 288
it tells the parents what their bmi index is. %$* 288
the result? %$* 288
well, i don't think it's helped them teach arithmetic because the teachers are distracted. %$* 288
but the kids are just as fat. %$* 288
it's made no difference in obesity in the schools. %$* 288
some states say, we ought to have some taxes, taxes on bad food. %$* 288
and intuitively, this makes sense. %$* 288
let's tax candy and, oh, then they'll eat less candy. %$* 288
they'll eat more fruits and vegetables. %$* 288
so illinois did that. %$* 288
six percent tax on candy. %$* 288
but what's the result? %$* 288
it's just confusing. %$* 288
what is candy? %$* 288
they decide, okay, a hershey bar is candy, but a kit kat bar, that's food because it's got flower in it. %$* 288
so this enriches the bureaucrats and the lawyers, but it doesn't help anybody lose weight. %$* 288
in new york city, the government requires calorie counts now to be posted in restaurants. %$* 288
and that makes sense. %$* 288
information is good. %$* 288
so nyu did a study of that and found that, yes, adults say they were influenced by the calorie postings. %$* 288
but then they checked the receipts, and they found the people ordered slightly more calories. %$* 288
government can't make us thinner. %$* 288
government can't control our personal behavior in that way. %$* 288
and even if it could, we're spending $3.8 trillion going broke. %$* 288
we couldn't afford to do this even if it worked. %$* 288
we don't need government to do this. %$* 288
there are only two ways to do things in life: voluntary or force. %$* 288
government is force. %$* 288
we need some force to keep us safe. %$* 288
but voluntary is better. %$* 288
and voluntary abounds. %$* 288
we have plenty of diet information. %$* 288
all these diet websites, books on nutrition, tv shows like the biggest loser, diet gurus are celebrities. %$* 288
that's enough. %$* 288
we don't need government taking our money, and we don't need government force. %$* 288
thank you, john stossel. %$* 13
so here's where we are. %$* 13
we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters arguing out this motion: "obesity is the government's business." you have heard the first two debaters. %$* 13
and now to introduce our third. %$* 13
to debate in support of the motion that "obesity is the government's business," here is webmd's chief lifestyle correspondent, a professor of medicine at the university of maryland and former pew foundation scholar in nutrition and metabolism, dr. %$* 13
pamela peeke. %$* 13
obesity is the government's business. %$* 415
you hear from the opposing side that we're looking at a nanny state or food policing. %$* 415
au contraire, that's not what we're looking for at all. %$* 415
voluntary? %$* 415
we give you voluntary. %$* 415
that's what we're looking for. %$* 415
i wear many hats. %$* 415
i'm a physician first, and i hail from the front trenches, face to face with my patients and as chief lifestyle expert for webmd's 90 million members, click to click with my cyber folks. %$* 415
this is where i practice high-tech touch. %$* 415
i set up a discussion group asking, is obesity the government's business? %$* 415
it lit up like kyoto at nighttime. %$* 415
it was fabulous. %$* 415
the bottom line was, yes, obesity is the government's business for leadership, education, protection, options, opportunities, infrastructure. %$* 415
no sidewalk, no walk. %$* 415
no park, no play. %$* 415
no bike path, lots of accidents. %$* 415
bottom line, what they said was, "no blame, no shame. %$* 415
no tax, no bans." they drew a line in the sand. %$* 415
and dr. %$* 415
satcher and i agree with that. %$* 415
obesity is the government's business. %$* 415
i'm going to flip now to my public health hat. %$* 415
government cannot solve the obesity problem alone. %$* 415
a problem as large as obesity, pun fully intended, requires all sectors of society to bring our thinking to the table. %$* 415
so i argue for government private sector partnerships. %$* 415
shouldn't be just the government at all. %$* 415
when we initiate a voluntary campaign or an effort, we want to be able to offer people options and opportunities because if there is no choice, there can be no moderation. %$* 415
we're in new york city. %$* 415
i love this place. %$* 415
and although you just heard that some of what you're doing isn't working so well, i say, forget all that. %$* 415
you have programs here, for instance, mayor bloomberg has joined with 500 other mayors with the "let's move cities and town" campaign to be able to work, drill down into the neighborhoods. %$* 415
what we can do to be able to improve physical activity as well as nutrition. %$* 415
in addition, the "fresh" program, food retailed expansion to support health programs. %$* 415
say that three times. %$* 415
the food retail expansion to support health program has set up 14 supermarkets in food deserts. %$* 415
this was a private-public collaboration, a partnership that worked. %$* 415
we now have fresh produce out there. %$* 415
and that's really important. %$* 415
of course, we have so many other measures that have taken place. %$* 415
good grief, we have play streets. %$* 415
we've taken quiet streets and turned them into play yards because we have nothing else out there. %$* 415
we're using what we can. %$* 415
we're doing what we can. %$* 415
at the national level, obviously we're looking at prevention now. %$* 415
the national prevention and health promotion strategy to stop disease before it starts. %$* 415
million hearts campaign. %$* 415
let's move actually celebrates its second anniversary this month alone. %$* 415
and it's been reaching out to everyone from rei for outdoor, you know, to a beverage industry for clear on calories so you can begin to understand what's going on in those labels. %$* 415
is it perfect? %$* 415
absolutely not. %$* 415
is it voluntary, and does it touch people's lives? %$* 415
hell yeah. %$* 415
i'm on the board of america on the move, and we're moving. %$* 415
we have corporate sponsors. %$* 415
we do private, public sponsorships all year long. %$* 415
we do this in neighborhoods, in states all across this country. %$* 415
we touch people. %$* 415
exercise is medicine, i am their national spokesperson, a collaboration of the american medical association as well as the american college of sports medicine. %$* 415
and here we see again trying to show people that there are simple, small steps, literally, that you can take to be able to help yourself, voluntary, nothing stuffed up your nose. %$* 415
we're not going to the tax and ban place. %$* 415
we're not food policing. %$* 415
we're reaching out asking people to hold our hand and say, come on. %$* 415
we can do this together. %$* 415
is it sloppy? %$* 415
yeah. %$* 415
are we perfect? %$* 415
no. %$* 415
we're about as perfect as the people who create them and implement them. %$* 415
we're human. %$* 415
we're getting there. %$* 415
i'm going to switch over to my last hat for my seven minutes as a researcher. %$* 415
guess what? %$* 415
the national institutes of health is public funding. %$* 415
$32 billion to save your lives, to do the work we do. %$* 415
it's interesting, when i began my work there as a senior scientist, i went to the clinical director's office, and above the office there was a sign that said, "in god we trust," and there was a little sign below it that said, "everyone else must show data." fairly straightforward. %$* 415
we wanted to see some good data here. %$* 415
and so in our laboratory we showed the connection between chronic stress for instance and the buildup of that toxic fat deep inside your belly which increases your risk for heart disease and diabetes. %$* 415
we showed for instance that it's not about elmm, "eat less, move more." that's so important, however, so much bigger. %$* 415
we forgot the mind. %$* 415
what about stress? %$* 415
new research has just been published showing that children who are stressed, and you know what that's about, in their childhood, at home, at school, eat more, and that's that stress-fat connection that we talk about so often. %$* 415
what are we doing about that? %$* 415
we have a new science called, "epigenetics," we're trying to look at how we can literally change gene expression, how we turn on and off genes, by simply doing easy things like if i eat an apple every day on a regular basis i get that gene expression and therefore i'm able to what? %$* 415
have an increased or decreased vulnerability toward obesity. %$* 415
or i could just do what so many people do, that nocturnal ménage à trois every night, you know what i'm talking about, you, ben, and jerry. %$* 415
all together in bed watching the tube, hanging out, doing it. %$* 415
doesn't work, all right? %$* 415
what's that gene expression looking like? %$* 415
all right. %$* 415
so here we're looking at something that's a brand new phenomenon, something we love to call "secondhand obesity." what we're looking at is virally, families, what's going on with them? %$* 415
how are we touching kids? %$* 415
it's so much bigger than demonizing sugar. %$* 415
it's so much bigger, so much bigger than saying the government's just too fat. %$* 415
what we're saying is, putting our hand out, we're trying to say, "educate, bigger brain, better choices, obesity is the government's business." %$* 415
thank you, pamela peeke. %$* 13
and that is our motion, "obesity is the government's business." and now here, our final debater against the motion, paul campos. %$* 13
he is professor of law at the university of colorado in boulder, and author of "the obesity myth: why america's obsession with weight is hazardous to your health." %$* 13
thank you. %$* 416
i think that the fundamental difficulty here is that, despite the great courtesy of the organizers of this debate to invite me, i'd like to start by pointing out that this debate is framed in completely the wrong way. %$* 416
to have a motion that says, "obesity is the government's business," essentially begs the question because using the term "obesity" frames the debate as one which is about the supposedly pathological state of people who have a body mass index of about 30 if they're obese or above 25 if they're overweight. %$* 416
and that in itself essentially tells us that we ought to think about those states as being per se bad and in fact a diseased or a quasi-diseased state. %$* 416
imagine if this debate were framed as, "eliminating body diversity is the government's business." i think that would sound a lot different, but in point of fact there is really-- %$* 416
there is no practical distinction between those two motions. %$* 416
the assumptions at work here are that a narrow range of body weight is normal for human beings and that outside that range a variation is the product of poor lifestyle. %$* 416
furthermore, it's assumed in the framing of this issue that by reforming poor lifestyle either voluntarily or quasi coercively, you can eliminate abnormal body weight. %$* 416
this is all wrong. %$* 416
there's nothing normal about normal body weight. %$* 416
it's not normal statistically. %$* 416
it's not normal epidemiologically. %$* 416
the overweight category of bmi 25 to 29.9 does not, in fact, feature increased overall health risk, so there isn't even a correlation there between increased health risk and the pathologizing of that body state. %$* 416
the vast majority of people, and i'm going to say this about 27 times tonight, cannot intentionally modify their body mass in a long term fashion successfully. %$* 416
there is no better established proposition empirically in all of medicine than that. %$* 416
in other words, people, as you all know-- %$* 416
well, i shouldn't say "all of you," but many of you know from personal experience-- %$* 416
find it extraordinarily difficult to change their body weight in a significant long term way voluntarily. %$* 416
government intervention in this area, and my partner, john stossel is quite correct in saying that. %$* 416
in comparison to him, i am almost a stalinist in my enthusiasm for government intervention, although i think he did overstate a couple of my positions. %$* 416
i won’t get into those because that’s beside the point. %$* 416
but in fact, even though i am generally enthusiastic about various forms of government regulation that fill him with dread, i am in fact utterly opposed to government regulation in this area because i think government-- %$* 416
the same as-- %$* 416
obesity as government’s business is almost a kind of dream scenario for a libertarian. %$* 416
because a libertarian could not come up with a better example of government dysfunction than of the notion that we’re supposed to make people thinner, mainly because-- %$* 416
well, for a bunch of reasons, which i want to go through quickly right now and then come back to later. %$* 416
here i want to emphasize first of all that we do not know an enormous number of things that we would have to know if we were going to have a rational policy that was based on the notion that we were going to make everybody have a bmi between 18.5 and 24.9, the so-called normal range, which for an average height woman would be between 108 and 144 pounds, outside of that supposedly pathological. %$* 416
here’s what we don’t know. %$* 416
we don’t know how to produce significant long-term weight loss. %$* 416
we just don’t. %$* 416
we don’t know if such weight loss would be beneficial. %$* 416
this hypothesis has not been tested for the very good reason that since we don’t know how to produce it, we can’t test the hypothesis. %$* 416
we don’t know to what extent, if at all, the generally weak associations between obesity and increased health risk are products of a causal relationship as opposed to markers for other things like, for example, dieting, weight cycling, diet drug use, eating disorders, stress, stigma, and lower socioeconomic status. %$* 416
we don’t know why weight went up among americans in the 1980s and ‘90s. %$* 416
we don’t know why it was stable in the 1960s and ‘70s. %$* 416
we don’t know why it has plateaued over the course of the last 10 years. %$* 416
we don’t in fact know whether people are more sedentary today than they were 40 years ago. %$* 416
we just don’t have the data on that. %$* 416
we just have a few very indirect markers for that, such as the amount of mandatory gym periods in school, but we don’t have any direct measurement of how active people were 40 years ago. %$* 416
we don’t know whether people consume more calories today than they did 40 years ago. %$* 416
again, the data is not available. %$* 416
people often-- %$* 416
you know, when that’s pointed out to them rather rudely by someone like me, the reaction of public health officials tends to be something like, “well, it’s just common sense,” right. %$* 416
but see, common sense is what you invoke when you don’t have data, right. %$* 416
that’s why we have these academic institutions, right, so that we don’t just rely on common sense. %$* 416
we actually try to have some evidence for our propositions. %$* 416
here’s what we do know. %$* 416
we do know that public health interventions designed to produce weight loss do not produce weight loss. %$* 416
this hypothesis has been tested. %$* 416
it’s been tested in situations where we have had intense public health intermediations that are much more intense than those that we could produce on a population-wide scale. %$* 416
and those interventions do not produce weight loss, either in adults or children. %$* 416
we do know that labeling bodies as diseased is stigmatizing, and we know that stigma is very bad for health, as are stress, weight cycling, and eating disorders, which are other things that are produced by this kind of labeling. %$* 416
we do know that risk factors that are associated with obesity, like, for instance, hypertension, can be addressed cheaply and successfully through inexpensive drugs that work quite well and increased physical activity, which is beneficial for people of all shapes and sizes whether in fact it produces any weight loss, which it usually doesn’t. %$* 416
finally, what i really would want to emphasize here above all is that healthy lifestyles don’t eliminate body diversity, which is found among people with a wide variety of body types, many of whom fall outside the phony, so-called normal range. %$* 416
and so, what i would advocate more than anything else is that we ought to focus on a harm reduction, not weight reduction. %$* 416
we’ve already had some indications tonight of the notion that we don’t want to stress people. %$* 416
here’s a suggestion. %$* 416
stop telling them that their bodies are pathological because that’s very stressful. %$* 416
that’s not good for people. %$* 416
and if you say that you don’t want to stigmatize obese people but you just want to stigmatize obesity, i would suggest that that is a protocol that’s not going to be successful. %$* 416
thank you. %$* 416
thank you, paul campos. %$* 13
and that concludes round one of this intelligence square u.s.debate. %$* 13
and remember, we had you vote in the beginning, and we’re going to ask you to vote again at the end. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers have changed the most will be declared our winner. %$* 13
now, onto round two where the debaters will address each other directly and take questions from me and from you in the audience and from slate readers who have submitted questions and from people watching on foratv, we have two teams of two here arguing out this motion: "obesity is the government's business."on one side, arguing in support of this motion, david satcher and pamela peeke. %$* 13
they are arguing that we have a national emergency underway, a record of weight gain among americans that threatens to bankrupt the health care system and to break the health of those who are obese, but they also offer hope in the role of government as-- %$* 13
in its ability to offer leadership and protection and infrastructure in support of the actions of those individuals who do want to lose weight. %$* 13
the side arguing against includes john stossel and paul campos. %$* 13
they are arguing in a two-pronged attack. %$* 13
one is, they're basically saying the research is wrong that says that obesity is killing us. %$* 13
and the research is wrong that suggests that we even know how to lose weight. %$* 13
they're also saying basically that whenever uncle sam attempts to govern the health of an individual, uncle sam always gets it wrong. %$* 13
so there's a lot to talk about there and a lot to explore. %$* 13
and i want to go first to the side arguing in support of the motion. %$* 13
what your opponents have left hanging out there repeatedly is the notion that government's track record already is terrible, that over the last 20 years, 30 years, as government programs have been put into place, we've just gotten heavier. %$* 13
so take that on. %$* 13
what-- %$* 13
what is the evidence that in fact government can have an impact on obesity of individuals? %$* 13
david satcher. %$* 13
well, i think the evidence is related to several things. %$* 414
first, we had a very interesting study funded by nih in the late '90s, early part of this 2000. %$* 414
and basically showed that if we could get people to be physically active and to change their diet, even if they lost only five to 15 percent of their weight, we could dramatically decrease the risk for diabetes, in fact almost 60 percent reduction among african- americans and american indians in the onset of type ii diabetes, by getting people to change their lifestyles and to be more physically active and to consume diets with less saturated fats and sugars. %$* 414
so i think we do know, from that study, that it's possible to help people change lifestyles. %$* 414
and i did say help because pamela is correct, there are a lot of people in this country who do not have access to healthy lifestyles. %$* 414
and it is in fact a responsibility of government to make sure that everybody has the opportunity, everybody has access to the opportunity for healthy lifestyles. %$* 414
but the point of the question goes not just to the theory behind it, but the track record of the government. %$* 13
the track record that i mentioned was the one dealing with african-americans and american indians in terms of reducing-- %$* 414
okay. %$* 13
the risk for diabetes mellitus. %$* 414
let me go to the other side. %$* 13
paul campos, would you like to respond? %$* 13
yes. %$* 416
in fact in that study-- %$* 416
paul, can you move just a touch closer to your mic? %$* 13
yes, right. %$* 416
and it's a study that dr. %$* 416
satcher was citing there, there was an average of 2.3 kilograms of weight loss, which is about four pounds. %$* 416
the difficulty with citations to the notion that a small amount of weight loss is going to greatly reduce the risk of type ii diabetes is that a couple things, one, you can't-- %$* 416
you cannot disentangle the amount of weight loss that is produced, which is generally quite small, from the beneficial effect of the lifestyle intervention. %$* 416
the way that you would want to test that, to say, well, let's look at the people who've lost weight and compare them to the people who didn't lose weight if they all engage in the same lifestyle intervention. %$* 416
is there a dose response that is related to the weight loss? %$* 416
and the answer is no, there isn't. %$* 416
in those studies, the people who engaged in the same lifestyle changes but didn't lose weight had the same reduction, on average, in type ii diabetes risk as people who engaged in the lifestyle changes and did in fact lose some weight. %$* 416
so to me, that's really compelling evidence for the notion that focusing on weight in that context doesn't make any sense. %$* 416
i'm all for focusing on, you know, lifestyle changes. %$* 416
i think it's good to encourage people to be physically active. %$* 416
but there's a lot of evidence that physical activity in and of itself is beneficial. %$* 416
but what there's not evidence of is that either physical activity changes are going to produce significant long-term weight loss. %$* 416
again, they don't in the vast majority of people, or secondly, that the weight loss is necessary for the purposes of getting the benefits of the increase in the-- %$* 416
okay. %$* 13
in the activity levels. %$* 416
i want to go to pamela peeke. %$* 13
you're on the side with the two doctors. %$* 13
your opponents are basically saying-- %$* 13
they're blowing up conventional wisdom here-- %$* 13
mm-hmm. %$* 415
by saying this-- %$* 13

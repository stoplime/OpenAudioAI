i’m robert rosenkranz, chairman of intelligence squared. %$* 1
with me is dana wolfe, our executive producer, and it’s my pleasure to welcome you tonight. %$* 1
this is the final debate, the eighth debate of our inaugural season. %$* 1
we launched this debate series with the goal of raising the level of public discourse in this country, and i think we’re very gratified with the reception that we’ve received. %$* 1
i want to express my thanks to national public radio, through whose auspices tonight’s debate will heard in over sixty radio stations around the country, including most of the major ones. %$* 1
wnyc is producing the ra-, the radio broadcast. %$* 1
the format is a debate in which three panelists on each side try to persuade you to vote their way on a resolution. %$* 1
the resolution tonight is, “a booming china spells trouble for america.” well, why did we pick this topic? %$* 1
first of all, it seems clear that the emergence of china as an, as an economic superpower is perhaps the most dramatic economic event in our lifetime. %$* 1
since china’s economic liberalization in 1978, the average person in rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america china is about twelve times better off. %$* 1
pretty extraordinary for a single generation. %$* 1
with some 1.3 billion souls, china has orchestrated the biggest improvement in material well being in human history. %$* 1
chinese imports provide about a thousand dollars in increased purchasing power for the average american family. %$* 1
it’s become the fastest growing market for u.s.exports, a very exciting, uh, set of investment opportunities for u.s.business. %$* 1
it’s offered the world a almost a “how to do it” manual for transitioning from a state controlled economy, uh, to an economy where the private sector is larger and the state sector smaller than virtually any developed country in the world, save the united states. %$* 1
so why tonight’s debate? %$* 1
where might the trouble lie for america? %$* 1
well, perhaps it’s in our two hundred and thirty billion dollar trade deficit. %$* 1
perhaps it’s because a million eight hundred thousand american jobs have been lost. %$* 1
perhaps it’s because china’s, uh, appetite for raw materials, natural resources has, uh, pushed it toward very close relationships with countries like iran. %$* 1
with china’s military buildup, which was most recently, demonstrated by its ability to destroy an orbiting satellite. %$* 1
as in so much of america’s high- tech military resou-, relies on satellite communications for commanded control, this was a particularly strategic, provocation. %$* 1
interestingly, this debate does not fall along traditional ideological lines. %$* 1
my, perhaps list, energizes the anti- rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america globalization left, as well as security hawks on the right. %$* 1
but which side can marshal the facts and analysis to support their view? %$* 1
well, we have an exceptionally strong panel this evening. %$* 1
our moderator is british journalist james harding, who since last year has been business and city editor of the times of london, our media sponsor. %$* 1
and prior to this, james was with the, financial times, serving as washington bureau chief, media editor, and prior thereto as correspondent in china, where he opened the shanghai office, or shanghai bureau, i should say. %$* 1
and it’s now my pleasure to pass the evening on to james. %$* 1
thank you, bob. %$* 171
thank you very much, bob. %$* 171
i’d like to welcome you all to the eighth intelligence squared debate here in the u.s.let me give you a brief rundown of what we’re gonna do this evening. %$* 171
um, first, the proposer of the motion will start by presenting their side of the argument. %$* 171
the opposition will follow. %$* 171
and then each person will get a maximum of eight minutes, and we will go back and forth from one side to the other. %$* 171
second, when all six speakers are finished with their opening remarks, i will open up the floor to brief questions from the audience. %$* 171
third, when the q&a is complete, each debater will make a final statement lasting not more than two minutes per person. %$* 171
and fourth, after the closing statement is made, you’ll vote on tonight’s motion with the keypad that is attached to rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america the armrest of your seat. %$* 171
fifth and last, i will announce the results. %$* 171
now, before hearing from our panelists, i’d like to start with a pre-debate vote. %$* 171
you’ll see that, on the armrest to your left, there is a keypad, uh, it looks like this. %$* 171
and for audience members sitting along the aisle, you’ll find it just to your right. %$* 171
uh, sorry, the keypad is, the way, it’s the one that i’m holding up here in my right hand, it should be on your right hand side, i apologize. %$* 171
i think you’ll find in the debate, there won’t be such confusion between left and right. %$* 171
now, after my prompt, what i’d like you to do is press “one” for the motion, press “two” against the motion, and if you’re undecided press “three.” please begin voting now. %$* 171
apparently it is on the left, but i hope you’ve all got one and as long as you’ve got one, you voted with it. %$* 171
rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america secretary of defense on future planning issues, and advisor to the pentagon on asian affairs and long-term defense planning. %$* 171
against the motion, there’s the founder and chairman and chief executive officer of the mcgregor, of mcgregor & company, author, and the former chief executive of dow jones in china, james mcgregor. %$* 171
then we have daniel h.rosen, the principal of china strategic advisory, adjunct associate professor at columbia university and visiting fellow with the institute of international economics. %$* 171
and ambassador j.stapleton roy, managing director of kissinger associates and a three-time ambassador serving singapore, the people’s republic of china, and indonesia. %$* 171
right, those were the formalities, now let’s get on with the debate, starting with bill gertz, over to you. %$* 171
the question before the house is, “is a booming china, does a booming china spell trouble for america? %$* 172
” the answer, in my view, is a resounding yes. %$* 172
in the next few minutes, i’m going to explain why. %$* 172
but first, what i call “the china threat,” which is something that beijing likes to refer to as “the china threat theory,” is in fact real. %$* 172
uh, it is a danger and it is growing. %$* 172
um, as a, as the late cia analyst and white house national security council official, constantin menges put it in his book china: the gathering threat, he said the reason that china poses a threat is because, despite its economic reforms, it is today ruled by a rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america nuclear armed communist dictatorship. %$* 172
this is the source of, of the trouble. %$* 172
i’ve identified what i call eleven sources of trouble for the united states from china, and i’m going to list them for you, and then talk briefly with the time remaining on, in some detail on it. %$* 172
the first is china’s military buildup. %$* 172
number two is the danger of war over taiwan. %$* 172
number three is expansionism over energy resources. %$* 172
number four is the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and missiles. %$* 172
number five is massive intelligence operations to steal u.s.secrets and technology. %$* 172
number six is influence operations and so-called money diplomacy. %$* 172
number seven is unfair trade practices, including currency valuation manipulation. %$* 172
number eight, intellectual property theft. %$* 172
number nine, human rights abuses. %$* 172
number ten, religious repression. %$* 172
and number eleven, environmental degradation and global warming. %$* 172
to start with, the most serious trouble for america from china is china’s military buildup. %$* 172
on january eleventh of this year, china conducted an unprecedented anti-satellite missile test. %$* 172
they fired a missile that traveled through space and hit a low earth orbit satellite, a chinese weather satellite, destroying it and creating, uh, sixteen thousand pieces of debris, which pose a threat to other satellites. %$* 172
u.s.official were shocked by this development because u.s.intelligence estimates of china’s military have been stating for years that china is ten, fifteen, rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america maybe twenty years behind the united states. %$* 172
that it is so far behind that there is no way china’s military could pose a threat. %$* 172
what the chinese asat test showed was that china is not seeking to follow the u.s.missile for missile, ship for ship, submarine for submarine. %$* 172
they’re going after niche weapons, they’re trying to leap ahead with special technology, and they’re doing this in a number of key areas, one of which is anti-satellite weapons. %$* 172
officials in washington estimate that by, within the next, uh, six years, china will have the capability of destroying all u.s.low earth orbit satellites. %$* 172
basically, this could be the modern day equivalent of a space pearl harbor against the united states if there were a conflict over taiwan. %$* 172
regarding taiwan, the danger of war over the taiwan strait continues. %$* 172
china has not renounced the, its plan to use force to retake the island. %$* 172
it is applying pressure, across the board, uh, to pressure this democracy. %$* 172
it is succeeding in many ways to influencing u.s.policy in ways that would diminish support for this traditional ally. %$* 172
the danger of china expanding to gain resources is kind of a new, uh, source of trouble that has been identified by some studies in the pentagon one of which was called the so-called “string of pearls strategy.” it shows that china, uh, is developing a string of pearls, bases, alliances along a path going from the middle east, where all of its, much of its oil comes from, all the way to china. %$* 172
there are very much concerns rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america that because energy is so, uh, integral to china’s modernization effort, that china at some point will have to expand militarily, perhaps the russian far east, perhaps southeast asia, uh, to take over, uh, places that have, uh, valuable oil and gas resources. %$* 172
intelligence operations. %$* 172
uh, this is a subject that i have focused on in my recent book. %$* 172
it also, uh, highlights the case of chi mak, who was a chinese intelligence agent, recently convicted in california of uh, of being an unregistered agent of the chinese government. %$* 172
it’s part of a, a mushrooming spy case, more of which will be coming out in, in the coming weeks and months, uh, which shows that china has been very successful in stealing some of the most advanced u.s.weapons technology, including the next generation quiet electric drive for our war ships, uh, secrets about our submarine force, and as well as the aegis battle management system, which is the heart of the, the modern navy. %$* 172
as for influence operations, this is another area where china has been extremely successful in influencing policies, uh, against the united states. %$* 172
we see this through so- called, what one chinese defector called “money diplomacy,” uh, buying up former u.s.officials, and using those officials to lobby against policies that china doesn’t like. %$* 172
uh, this is having a, a deleterious effect on the u.s.economy and u.s.policy because it’s preventing the united states from truly understanding the directions and goals of china’s military modernization and its, rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america uh, its general modernization as well. %$* 172
representative randy forbes, the chairman of the china caucus in the house of representatives estimates that china spends upwards of one hundred million dollars annually, uh, on these influence operations. %$* 172
unfair trade practices and currency issues, as well as, uh, uh, intellectual property theft. %$* 172
these issues are fairly well known, but i would like to highlight one issue surrounding the whole trade question. %$* 172
the main policy for the united states towards china has been to trade with china as a way to seek a liberalized chinese government and political system. %$* 172
unfortunately, the idea of trading with china as a liberal, a liberalizing factor is not working. %$* 172
in fact, just the other, just the opposite is happening. %$* 172
uh, many feel that china’s buildup, its military buildup is being benefited by its economic growth, but yet we have seen little or no political reform in china. %$* 172
this is a, a very serious source of trouble for the united states. %$* 172
on human rights abuses, i would also point out how, at its core, china has never fully resolved that the tiananmen massacre in 1989, when pro-democracy protesters %$* 172
occupied the square. %$* 172
um, as well, religious re-, repression is also in this field, as well as environmental degradation. %$* 172
uh, as rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america many as seven out of ten chinese major rivers are now dead. %$* 172
this debate has often been couched as, as between engagement and contained, but really, the, the issue here is that what china needs is democracy, and that is really the, the solution to mitigating these sources of trouble for the united states. %$* 172
one minute. %$* 171
occupied the square. %$* 172
um, as well, religious re-, repression is also in this field, as well as environmental degradation. %$* 172
uh, as rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america many as seven out of ten chinese major rivers are now dead. %$* 172
this debate has often been couched as, as between engagement and contained, but really, the, the issue here is that what china needs is democracy, and that is really the, the solution to mitigating these sources of trouble for the united states. %$* 172
bill gertz, many thanks indeed. %$* 171
a model of timeliness. %$* 171
now to, um, stand against the motion “beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america,” i call upon stapleton roy. %$* 171
good evening. %$* 173
let me begin with a dangerous confession. %$* 173
i love fu manchu novels. %$* 173
i have read them all, i have seem every movie version that i can get my hand on. %$* 173
nothing sends shudders up my spine so much as contemplating sinister chinese scheming to control the world. %$* 173
so when i was confronted with the question of whether a booming china spells trouble for the united states, my natural instinct was to think of fu man chu, and to give a resounding yes. %$* 173
but then i remembered that i had majored in history in college, not in the world’s great literature. %$* 173
when you look at what’s happening in china in terms of history and not in terms of fantasy fiction, you are forced to a very rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america different conclusion. %$* 173
i grew up in wartime china, i was in china as a high school student at the time of the communist revolution in 1949, i visited china three times during the turmoil of the cultural revolution. %$* 173
when i visit china now, the situation is so different and so much better than china was in those days. %$* 173
nevertheless, the question before you is a serious one. %$* 173
any country of 1.3 billion people can spell trouble for us or for the global system. %$* 173
i have dealt with china professionally for over thirty years, it has been troublesome throughout that period, our relations have improved, we have done well. %$* 173
but this is true that china can cause trouble, whether it’s in boom or bust. %$* 173
a china that is floundering with a sense of grievance against the world and disaffected with the international system would be a greater danger than a booming china that can feed and clothe its people, educate them domestically and abroad, buy vast amounts of u.s.goods and services, and benefit from the international system. %$* 173
that’s a far preferable outcome. %$* 173
can we handle china’s troublesome aspects? %$* 173
of course we can. %$* 173
we’re the world’ premiere military power. %$* 173
we have the most large, we have the largest and most productive economy in the world. %$* 173
we’re improving our military technology at a rate faster than china is. %$* 173
we have the world’s, i mentioned the economy, we’re a global leader in science and technology, our schools and graduate schools are the envy of the world. %$* 173
the one requirement for rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america handling any trouble that china causes is that we manage our domestic and international affairs so that we don’t squander the enormous advantages that we have. %$* 173
remember, trouble for us spells even bigger trouble for china. %$* 173
the advantage is on our side, not china’s. %$* 173
seven successive u.s.presidents over a space of thirty-five years have discovered that contain-, that containing troubles and developing common interests with china benefits us. %$* 173
three successive generations of chinese leaders have come to the same conclusion. %$* 173
such a track record should give us confidence. %$* 173
what’s more, experience over the last fifteen years of china’s rapid growth shows clearly that a booming china offers enormous opportunities for the united states, and holds out the prospect of positive change in the future. %$* 173
china’s rapid growth has created an enormous middle class, concentrated in china’s coastal provinces. %$* 173
this new middle class enjoys a level of affluence unthinkable in the 1970’s. %$* 173
these middle class chinese are educated, entrepreneurial, and outward looking. %$* 173
they have more in common with the middle classes elsewhere in asia than they have with the on-, the backward parts of their own country. %$* 173
they represent the building blocks for china’s eventual transition to a more representative form of government. %$* 173
china’s society is remarkably more open than it was before. %$* 173
hundreds of thousands of china’s best and brightest have been sent to the west, and primarily to the united states to study, the work, and rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america the spend years here. %$* 173
western educated chinese now occupy significant positions at all levels of government, business, and education in china. %$* 173
totally absent thirty years ago. %$* 173
in essence, china has abandoned marxism and leninism and class struggle in favor of marxism eco-, uh, market economics and promotion of a harmonious society. %$* 173
obviously, as china’s economy continues to grow, and as its military capabilities improve, we have to consider the possibility that a more powerful and prosperous china will become a security threat. %$* 173
a highly nationalistic china under poor leaders or under bad leaders would pose serious problems for us and for the global community. %$* 173
two aspects are of particular concern. %$* 173
china’s military spending has been growing at double digit rates for the last fifteen years, china’s defense forces are preparing for taiwan scenarios, that include the possibility of u.s.intervention. %$* 173
does this mean we should sound the alarms, and assume that conflict with china is inevitable over taiwan? %$* 173
the answer is no. %$* 173
the situation calls for vigi-, vigilance, not for alarm. %$* 173
u.s.military leaders are not sitting on their thumbs. %$* 173
they’re constantly improving our force posture, they’re pointedly confident that we can handle any challenges and they believe that conflict can be avoided. %$* 173
such confidence is warranted. %$* 173
we in china have developed an effective framework from ma- managing the taiwan issue. %$* 173
both countries, the united states rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america and china have stated that they are opposed to unilateral changes in the status quo with respect to taiwan. %$* 173
in addition, enormous common interests have developed on both sides of the taiwan strait, interests missing, before we befriended china. %$* 173
taiwan has brought over a hundred billion dollars of investment into the mainland. %$* 173
millions of taiwanese visit the mainland. %$* 173
taiwan exports more across the taiwan straits now than it does to the united states. %$* 173
in the meantime, taiwan runs its own affairs, it elects its own presidents, and it benefits from membership in the world trade organization and in the asia pacific economic cooperation forum. %$* 173
in per capita gdp terms, taiwan ranks just behind the european union and ahead of countries such as spain, new zealand, and south korea. %$* 173
it would require ineptitude on a massive scale in beijing, washington, and taipei for this situation to generate into a military conflict. %$* 173
to conclude, an alarmist view of china exaggerates the dangers and obscures the opportunities. %$* 173
china’s economy is now ten times larger than it was in 1978 and our relations with china are better. %$* 173
and china has significant defense liabilities. %$* 173
its most modern, advanced military equipment comes from russia, an unreliable source. %$* 173
after years rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america of rapid growth, china now in defense spending, china now spends approximately the same percentage of gdp that we do, but its gdp is much smaller than ours. %$* 173
its, its defense budget is less than half of the combined defense budgets of the uk, france, germany, and italy, all part of the european union with a common defense policy. %$* 173
my experience in asia has made me an optimist. %$* 173
i lived in taiwan under an authoritarian regime. %$* 173
it’s now a thriving democracy. %$* 173
i lived in thailand twice under military-dominated governments, only to see it move to, for a period uh, to thriving parliamentary democracy. %$* 173
i was in indonesia when an authoritative – %$* 173
gave way. %$* 173
to sum up, the troubles produced by china booming are manageable, the opportunities are encouraging, the outlook is hopeful if we display the traditional qualities that made us a great country – %$* 173
dragons are mythological – %$* 173
one minute. %$* 171
china’s economy is now ten times larger than it was in 1978 and our relations with china are better. %$* 173
and china has significant defense liabilities. %$* 173
its most modern, advanced military equipment comes from russia, an unreliable source. %$* 173

i was in indonesia when an authoritative – %$* 173
stapleton roy, i'm afraid i’m going to have to stop you there. %$* 171
gave way. %$* 173
to sum up, the troubles produced by china booming are manageable, the opportunities are encouraging, the outlook is hopeful if we display the traditional qualities that made us a great country – %$* 173
and the speech is coming to a close. %$* 171
dragons are mythological – %$* 173
thank you very much. %$* 171
this debate will be retitled rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s. - beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america “beware the moderator.” um, we now turn to michael pillsbury who is going to speak for the motion. %$* 171
thank you very much. %$* 174
as all of you know, here in sophisticated new york, state department and defense department often don’t get along. %$* 174
so it may come as a surprise to you – it certainly comes to a surprise to me – that i agree with every word of what stapleton roy just said. %$* 174
in fact, i believe our team wants to adopt him as a fourth member of our team, because he essentially is speaking in favor of the motion uh, as we see it. %$* 174
and i want to ask for your support for the motion in the way we define the two key words in the motion. %$* 174
the first word is “beware.” and we take that to mean be wary, be wary. %$* 174
the second key word, bill gertz went over eleven examples, is “trouble,” “spells trouble.” in other words, the burden on the other team to earn your vote is to say you should not beware, you should be blithely sort of confident that there will be no problems at all with china. %$* 174
they have to sustain that case. %$* 174
then they have to sustain the case that there will be no trouble from china, forever. %$* 174
it seems to me it should be unanimous tonight that our team is going to win, especially since stapleton roy essentially is working for us. %$* 174
i do want to say he characterized the defense department’s view rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america of china quite correctly, that’s very accurate. %$* 174
uh, going back for fifteen years now, secretaries of defense and chairmen of the joint chiefs have said over and over and over that china is not a threat to the united states. %$* 174
in fact, often they embellish and say china, for the foreseeable future, will not be a threat. %$* 174
so that’s the public position of the pentagon. %$* 174
it’s not looking for a war, there’s a very high level of confidence uh, that we will prevail in any conflict with china. %$* 174
um and what you actually get is a series of factual reports each year that come out that list the eleven examples of trouble that bill gertz gave as factual matters. %$* 174
but mr. %$* 174
roy, ambassador roy is correct that there’s a sense of confidence and not seeking any sort of conflict from china in the pentagon. %$* 174
there’s a sense of , that china is not a threat. %$* 174
and frankly, i have, since we’re telling autobiographical stories, i have had about thirty-five years meeting with chinese generals uh, from the first meet up here in the united nations not far from here all the way to last week when the delegation of generals was hosted by us in the pentagon. %$* 174
enormous changes have taken place but not necessarily for the, for the better. %$* 174
if you go back all the way to the beginning of the u.s.military relationship with the chinese communists, it’s really 1944 that we began to do some intelligence cooperation against the japanese in the middle of world war ii.that came out of something called the dixie mission that some of you, i think in the audience, look like you rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america remember it. %$* 174
but six years later, six years later we’re at war with china. %$* 174
tragic, tragic war where the chinese to this day claimed they warned us. %$* 174
they used this strange phrase about “we won't put our hands in our sleeves” and that was supposed to mean we’re going to send three hundred thousand troops in and destroy american forces. %$* 174
we didn’t understand it that way. %$* 174
and a tragic, avoidable war took place. %$* 174
twenty years of containment passed, another cycle began of military cooperation between the u.s.and china. %$* 174
uh, our generals and theirs have met hundreds of times. %$* 174
we in the eighties, under president reagan, who certainly would yield to nobody in his anti-communism, president reagan authorized the sale of six american sophisticated weapon systems to china. %$* 174
again a peak, by the end of 1944 when we were cooperating closely with the chinese. %$* 174
you almost couldn't have had more security cooperation than we did under president reagan with china. %$* 174
three years later, 1989, it had to all be canceled and not far from here out in bethpage, long island, two chinese jet fighters sort of mig23 jet fighters had to be crated up and sent back to china. %$* 174
and we refunded part of their money because of the tiananmen incident and the heart wrenching effect it had on american hopes for democracy and human rights in china. %$* 174
then in the last fifteen or sixteen years, there have been ups and rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america downs as stapleton roy correctly pointed out. %$* 174
but we’ve never gotten a pledge from china not to use force against taiwan. %$* 174
we’ve never settled, we’ve never really gotten credit for what henry kissinger did. %$* 174
uh, president nixon withdrew american nuclear weapons from taiwan. %$* 174
president nixon severed the military connection. %$* 174
president carter severed the fact that we kept two american generals there, one for arms supply, one to plan war with the defense of taiwan in mind. %$* 174
the chinese take that, those major concessions from us as though they never happened. %$* 174
and the chinese rhetoric today continues to talk about how the u.s., if it even sells one bullet to taiwan, this somehow strengthens the independence forces on taiwan. %$* 174
it’s simply not true. %$* 174
we have enormous self-imposed restrictions on our arms sales to taiwan. %$* 174
so across the board, we have a lack of progress in chinese nationalistic attitudes toward america. %$* 174
if you pull out an average chinese youth daily article today and you look up what does it say about the united states, it’s not very friendly. %$* 174
we have fifteen major programs now in foreign aid, in helping their banking system through our treasury department. %$* 174
our labor department has a mediation service, going to help them with labor disputes. %$* 174
every department of the u.s.government has what, in my view amounts to an aid program, a program of rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america engagement with china. %$* 174
very seldom mentioned in the chinese press. %$* 174
if you're a young chinese, you have the impression that america is trying to dismember china, that america poses a military threat, that america’s working with india and japan to somehow crush china or contain its rise. %$* 174
all of this nationalistic rhetoric ought to be banned in the chinese press. %$* 174
we don’t say these things in our press, but it hasn’t stopped the worst was 1999, i might point out, when the front page of the communist party daily, people’s daily, carried a long article called “the seven ways america is worse than nazi germany.” and it went into detail about which kind of gas the nazis had used in their camps, and then there was a paragraph, i’ll never forget it, saying the americans are even worse than that. %$* 174
so to support our side of this debate, you have to be wary, that is look for possibilities that might happen in the future where things may not be as rosy as we may have hoped. %$* 174
and you have to admit there’s trouble. %$* 174
that’s, that’s all we, we ask for our side. %$* 174
and i hope it will be unanimous, but we don’t, we don’t have to be, our side doesn’t have to be extreme. %$* 174
we don’t have to be alarmist about china, we don’t have to forecast an inevitable war. %$* 174
we don’t have to say that we should break off all relations. %$* 174
i rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america mention to you the fifteen aid programs, i want to close my last sentence with just one of the most impressive, to me, we have more than fifty agreements, governmental agreements to transfer american scientific findings to china for free. %$* 174
our national science foundation, our white house office of science and technology policy are in charge of this—chinese don’t really make a big deal out of it, but it’s an amazing program %$* 174
thank you. %$* 174
one minute. %$* 171

michael pillsbury, i'm afraid your time is up. %$* 171
thank you. %$* 174
thank you very much. %$* 171
we now turn to daniel rosen who is speaking against the motion. %$* 171
thank you very much james and uh, it’s a pleasure to be here this evening. %$* 175
i want to start by saying welcome to new york uh, to those supporting tonight’s proposition. %$* 175
while neo-cons and liberals alike uh, down in the beltway in washington and from other places around the country debate the theory and these concepts of grand strategy to do with china, we here in new york have been working very, very hard of course in our many professions to try to understand the nature of its reform, its growth, and make sure that we benefit as a nation from what’s rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america the epic changes taking place in this country, making sure that we don’t gauge china against the uh, abject failures of thirty, forty, fifty years ago, some of which have already been cited. %$* 175
but instead, recognize that china is not at all standing still uh, and is very much a work in progress. %$* 175
so i for one, very much look forward to the chance to debate these issues here tonight, the notion that china’s strengthening is bad news for us, which is really what we’re talking about of course. %$* 175
china’s boom is essentially economic at its core. %$* 175
so the role that uh, has been cast for me is to lay out three critical economic arguments uh, for why, whether you're a new yorker or not, uh, you should be very much against the motion that we have on the table before us this evening. %$* 175
first argument, china’s boom is benefiting others in a big way, not just china. %$* 175
secondly, that its growth is very much helping its people, not repressing them, and thus mitigating, in an important way, many threats that we’d have to deal with if china were not growing. %$* 175
and thirdly, that we the united states together with china, have larger economic responsibilities of a global nature that demand our mutual respect and our enthusiasm, in fact, instead of confrontation with china over its growth and strengthening. %$* 175
which indeed is what uh, is what we’re, we’re here to debate. %$* 175
let me exch-, uh, explain each of these very briefly. %$* 175
rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america first of all, china’s growth is benefiting the economies of rich and poor nations alike. %$* 175
japan, with merely forty percent of the labor force that the united states has, exports ten billion dollars worth of goods to china every month. %$* 175
the united states only exports half that amount. %$* 175
germany, with a mere one-quarter of our labor force, has run a net trade surplus with china over the period 1992 to today. %$* 175
the point of this is china is not an economy that is closed to rich-world exports at all. %$* 175
it’s very much open to them. %$* 175
developing nations, in southeast asia, in latin america, in africa, are also benefiting in a way the world bank couldn't have imagined a few years ago from china’s dynamic growth. %$* 175
it’s embracing china as a new destination for exports. %$* 175
even taiwan, that’s of such concern to us all here at this table, is in fact enjoying a sixty-six billion dollar a year trade surplus with its archenemy uh, the people’s republic of china, a trade surplus which has grown from fourteen to forty percent every year of this decade so far. %$* 175
taiwan in fact is moving away from the attitude behind the motion on the table this evening, away from confrontation and toward a working out of things in a peaceful manner, a deepening and integrating its economy with the mainland’s. %$* 175
bottom line: our fortunes here depend on what we do, on how we compete with china, not on what china does. %$* 175
we should spend more time competing with germany and japan, in rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america fact, for the chinese market, and less time blaming china for all of our troubles. %$* 175
of course the united states is already a major beneficiary of china’s economic activity. %$* 175
if we cut off all trade with china tomorrow, we would create very few american jobs, we would import practically everything we import from china, but from other countries at a higher price, which wouldn't really benefit anybody in this country. %$* 175
second major argument i want to make: china’s growth benefits its people and by doing so, mitigates profound troubles that would eventuate, if that were not the case. %$* 175
the real threats, the existential threat, threats to the united states today come from impoverished and stagnant states writhen by discontent and insecurity. %$* 175
north korea, iran, iraq, the middle east in general, stagnant economic situations in sudan, in venezuela, these are what, these are the engines that breed terrorism and nihilism which are the true threat and trouble we should be concerning ourselves with. %$* 175
china could have been among those. %$* 175
in fact the china of 1978, before the dreaded boom that we’re here to debate this evening, would have been one of those, by embracing our economic model in fact, which is what they’ve done, they’ve grown beyond that danger. %$* 175
and though eight hundred million chinese are still poor by our standards, they’re striving toward prosperity and not toward extremism. %$* 175
those people, those toiling rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america chinese are the boom that we’re here to pass judgment on this evening. %$* 175
and while their toil brings competitive challenges for us, we would be gravely mistaken to try to turn back the clock to the failed state china was before this boom began. %$* 175
prosperity is not an alternative to political change in china. %$* 175
in fact, it’s been the handmaiden of it. %$* 175
the totalitarian government ruling two hundred dollar per capita china in 1978 bears practically no resemblance to the chinese government managing a two thousand dollar per capita economy today. %$* 175
likewise, the chinese government that runs ten thousand dollar per capita china tomorrow will be vastly different than the one we deal with today. %$* 175
third major argument: beyond our narrow economic interests – and theirs – lie global economic responsibilities that must be addressed cooperatively. %$* 175
tonight we’re debating whether the benefits of a stronger china are worth the trouble it brings us along the way, or rather, whether the troubles of a stagnant china would suit our interests better, because that’s really the question. %$* 175
it’s which set of troubles suits the american interest and which does not? %$* 175
it’s a reasonable question, but such a narrow-minded calculus of self-interest alone does not befit a great power and certainly does not befit the united states. %$* 175
economic success, foremost ours and now china’s as well, is creating a great economic, political, and indeed security rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america challenge, climate change and an environmental crisis globally. %$* 175
the u.s.has refused to address its responsibility to carbon, on carbon emissions. %$* 175
and the reason given: china. %$* 175
a con- convenient fits-all-purposes ex-excuse not to act when you don’t want to act. %$* 175
china, interestingly enough, has refused to exact uh, except carbon commitments for the same reason. %$* 175
the united states should go first. %$* 175
this log jam is fueled by the mistrust that tonight’s motion puts forward, and indeed it cannot be permitted to stand. %$* 175
we have an economic responsibility to the planet to deal with this together or we’re going to lose more than anybody does. %$* 175
to finish, let me say this, i have a private practice in addition to being a think tanker and professor. %$* 175
and my customers are troubles. %$* 175
they’re troubles i’d like to have more of, frankly. %$* 175
i don't have a problem with troubles, we have more troubles with canada economically than we do with any other country. %$* 175
is that bad news for the united states? %$* 175
it’s not, it’s part of a mature relationship. %$* 175
those in favor of tonight’s motion counsel a strategy meant to leave china in ruins using a play book last used in the cold war, building up our military instead of our economy. %$* 175
who will join us in such a strategy? %$* 175
i urge you to vote against tonight’s motion. %$* 175
the troubles of a stagnant, unbooming china – %$* 175
far, far outweigh – %$* 175
the challenges of its growth. %$* 175
thank you. %$* 175
one minute. %$* 171
the united states should go first. %$* 175
this log jam is fueled by the mistrust that tonight’s motion puts forward, and indeed it cannot be permitted to stand. %$* 175
we have an economic responsibility to the planet to deal with this together or we’re going to lose more than anybody does. %$* 175
to finish, let me say this, i have a private practice in addition to being a think tanker and professor. %$* 175

who will join us in such a strategy? %$* 175
i urge you to vote against tonight’s motion. %$* 175
the troubles of a stagnant, unbooming china – %$* 175
rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s. - beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america daniel rosen, your time is up. %$* 171
far, far outweigh – %$* 175
your time is up. %$* 171
the challenges of its growth. %$* 175
thank you. %$* 175
thank you. %$* 171
now i turn to john mearsheimer, the last speaker uh, for the motion, “beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america.” %$* 171
the question on the table is does a rising china spell trouble for the united states. %$* 176
or in slightly different words from an american perspective, is a powerful china likely to be bad for the united states? %$* 176
i think the answer is axiomatically yes. %$* 176
and i say this not because i feel any personal hostility towards the chinese, which i certainly don’t, or because i think china is particularly aggressive because it was or is a communist country or it is run in an authoritarian political form. %$* 176
i think that matters very little and i don't say it because i think china’s likely to behave irrationally in the future. %$* 176
my argument is that the best situation rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america for the united states from the perspective of maximizing its security is to be the most powerful state in the international system. %$* 176
the bigger the gap between you and everybody else, the more secure you are. %$* 176
to put it in pentagonese, you don’t want a peer competitor in your national system. %$* 176
to give you two examples that highlight this point, think about the united states and its two immediate neighbors, canada and mexico. %$* 176
as you know, we are much more powerful than either one of those countries. %$* 176
none of you go to bed at night worrying about canada or mexico attacking the united states tomorrow, next week, or next year. %$* 176
that’s simply not going to happen because we’re so powerful. %$* 176
would you trade the present situation for one where canada and mexico or canada or mexico was twice as powerful as the united states? %$* 176
of course you wouldn't, it’s much better to have a situation where we’re the most powerful state in the western hemisphere. %$* 176
same basic logic applies to china. %$* 176
if china has two choices, one it can have a japan in asia that’s five times more powerful than china, or a situation where china is five more, five times more powerful than japan. %$* 176
which one of those alternatives do you think the chinese will choose? %$* 176
it’s an open-and-shut case. %$* 176
they’d much prefer to be five times more powerful. %$* 176
and the same basic argument applies to the united states and china. %$* 176
today, tomorrow, or at rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america any point in time. %$* 176
if you have a choice of being as powerful or less powerful than china, or being more powerful, which would you choose if you're interested in maximizing your security? %$* 176
an open and shut case. %$* 176
let me spell out the logic that underpins my argument. %$* 176
principal goal of any state in the international system, it’s not the only goal, but the principal goal is survival. %$* 176
and the reason is, if you don’t survive, you can’t pursue any other goals. %$* 176
the problem that states have is they operate in an anarchic system. %$* 176
that’s political science speak for saying that they operate in a system where there’s no higher authority that you can turn to if you get into trouble. %$* 176
now the question is, what does the system look like today? %$* 176
situation today from an american point of view is ideal. %$* 176
we’re by far the most powerful state on earth. %$* 176
we dominate the western hemisphere. %$* 176
there’s no state in our uh, region of the world that could possibly challenge us. %$* 176
we have tremendous power projection capabilities, which is why we’re called the only superpower in the world. %$* 176
and in asia and in europe, the two areas of the world where there are other great powers or potential great powers, we have no peer competitor. %$* 176
there’s no imperial japan, there’s no imperial germany, there’s no nazi germany, and there’s no soviet union. %$* 176
from an american point of view, that’s a wonderful situation. %$* 176
now, what is the future going to look like if in say, twenty years, china continues to grow economically the way it has grown over the last twenty years? %$* 176
what you're going to get is a country that’s economically pretty close to being as strong as the united states, and you could rest assured that china’s going to turn that economic might into military might. %$* 176
they’d be foolish if they didn’t. %$* 176
you’ll then have a country that’s roughly uh, the military equivalent of the united states, or at least close to it. %$* 176
that country is going to try to rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america dominate asia the way the united states has successfully dominated the western hemisphere. %$* 176
they’d be fools to do otherwise. %$* 176
do you think the founding fathers and their successors in this country were fools because they had attempted to establish, and did establish a germany in the western hemisphere? %$* 176
of course not. %$* 176
they did it for good security reasons. %$* 176
the asians will do the same, the chinese will do the same thing in asia. %$* 176
we have a monroe doctrine here in the united states. %$* 176
most of you know it very well. %$* 176
we basically tell the european and asian great powers that they have to stay out of our hemisphere. %$* 176
we don’t want them here. %$* 176
don’t you think the chinese are going to feel the same way in asia when they’re powerful enough to think about dominating asia? %$* 176
furthermore, they’re going to dominate, develop significant power projection capability just like we have developed power projection capability. %$* 176
they’re going to develop a blue water navy and that navy is going to be designed to go into the middle east, much the way our navy is designed to go in the middle east. %$* 176
when i was a young boy, my mother used to say what’s good for the goose is good for the gander. %$* 176
if it’s good for the united states, why don’t you think it’ll be good for china to try and dominate asia and to try and develop significant power projection capability? %$* 176
of course this all raises the question then, how is the united rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s. - beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america states likely to react? %$* 176
it’s very simple. %$* 176
we have a clear record here of how we’ll react when other countries try to dominate either europe or asia. %$* 176
we go to great lengths to stop them. %$* 176
imperial germany, imperial japan, nazi germany, and the former soviet union, they’re all on the scrap heap of history. %$* 176
and we played a key role in putting them there. %$* 176
the united states will not tolerate a situation where china tries to dominate asia. %$* 176
and as i said, china will try to dominate asia just the way the united states has tried to dominate and has succeeded at dominating the western hemisphere. %$* 176
what is my bottom line here? %$* 176
my bottom line is straightforward. %$* 176
the present situation is better for the united states and more stable than a world – %$* 176
in which china is as powerful or almost as powerful as the united states. %$* 176
in other words, if china rises, trouble is in store for the united states. %$* 176
thank you. %$* 176
one minute. %$* 171
in which china is as powerful or almost as powerful as the united states. %$* 176
in other words, if china rises, trouble is in store for the united states. %$* 176
thank you. %$* 176
john mearsheimer, thank you very much. %$* 171
and now finally, jim mcgregor speaking against the motion. %$* 171
well i, my name is jim mcgregor and i’ve lived in china for twenty years. %$* 177
and i'm just grateful that i did not make bill rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america gertz’s list of eleven threats from china. %$* 177
um it’s kind of intimidating being here among all these ph.d.s and well studied men. %$* 177
i ended up in china because i was expelled from high school. %$* 177
um, i joined the army when i got expelled from high school, they sent me to vietnam, that turned my head towards asia, led to me becoming a journalist. %$* 177
and as time went on, i wanted to get back to asia as a journalist, so i went to china in ’85 and backpacked through the country. %$* 177
um, ’87, i moved to taiwan to learn mandarin and i’ve lived in beijing since ’90, both as a journalist and a businessperson. %$* 177
all of the theories that i’ve heard tonight, i’ve read many times. %$* 177
my view is more kind of grass roots what china looks like on the ground and what i’ve seen. %$* 177
um, when i first moved to china as a reporter, i had secret police following, my phone was tapped. %$* 177
even the maid who took care of our nanny who helped us with our daughter was from the foreign ministry and made reports on us. %$* 177
um and this was a country that was just really emerging from the forest fire of the cultural revolution. %$* 177
and what i’ve seen since then has been kind of documented by other speakers here tonight on the fast growth. %$* 177
i’ve watched, the first uh, financial person i met in china was a guy named milen xiong who was a, a steel worker who had cornered the market on the four stocks on the illegal shanghai rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america stock market. %$* 177
um and now china’s um, doing the world’s largest ipos and in fact chinese stocks were the top performers on nasdaq last year. %$* 177
when i first got to beijing in the fall, you had big piles of cabbage on the corner because that was the only vegetable they got. %$* 177
people would bring it home, they’d shove it under their bed or in their cabinets and over the winter, you’d tear away the rotten leaves and you could eat the fresh leaves inside. %$* 177
well as you know, now, if i don’t see a new high rise everyday, i get a little jittery, it’s moving so fast. %$* 177
um international sophistication, when i went there in ’85, people would come up to me on the street and show me around for the day because they were so excited to learn about the outside world. %$* 177
while we’ve had six hundred thousand students alone from china come to the united states, chinese people are very international, traveling the world, doing business um, and even being involved in uh, academic uh, endeavors in the united states. %$* 177
so we’ve learned that china’s a very formidable country tonight and we better be scared of them um, because why? %$* 177
well china has grown very fast and it’s moving very fast, but what has happened during this period? %$* 177
china has been shoving all kinds of problems under the carpet. %$* 177
the carpet’s getting lumpy and the country will trip on these problems and it’s going to be very busy rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america for the new few decades fixing this. %$* 177
environment, china is trash. %$* 177
sixteen of the twenty worst air-polluted cities in the world are in china. %$* 177
i’ve traveled every province of china and i’ve never seen a clean body of water that was not in a bottle. %$* 177
um, healthcare, from a fairly decent healthcare system has become very commercial. %$* 177
two-thirds of people don’t have healthcare. %$* 177
if you're a peasant and your kid gets cancer, what do you do? %$* 177
you beg, borrow, and steal money to get them to a hospital in a city. %$* 177
uh, you have to deposit the money for your kid to be in that hospital. %$* 177
if you run out of money, they kick your kid out of that hospital. %$* 177
um the have and the have-not issue is growing and growing. %$* 177
there was eighty thousand demonstrations two years ago. %$* 177
last year they went down because they realized they better not be reporting on how many they had. %$* 177
um and on and on party corruption, etcetera. %$* 177
so this is this uh, colossus that’s going to take on the united states. %$* 177
what does china really want? %$* 177
from a military standpoint, china wants to protect its wealth. %$* 177
it’s been a country that’s been colonized. %$* 177
it also wants to have the military projection to be able to protect it, protect its own sea lanes. %$* 177
um from natural resources, china, the rocks have not been kind to china. %$* 177
they’re as dependent as we are or more on imported oil and other mat-, in iron ore and other raw materials. %$* 177
um the government. %$* 177
the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america government is running scared of its own people. %$* 177
you’ve got to realize when you have ten, ten, ten percent economic growth for twenty years and kids are growing up under that kind of growth, they expect exponential improvement every year forever. %$* 177
and the government has really no credibility other than economic growth and giving people a better life. %$* 177
so where does the united states have to worry? %$* 177
where do we really eclipse china? %$* 177
you can’t be a global leader without a leading ideology and china right now has no leading ideology other than getting rich. %$* 177
uh, right now the united states isn’t so popular around the world uh, with iraq and other issues. %$* 177
china is out working the world, but i’ll tell you, people are looking for u.s.leadership. %$* 177
we will not have trouble competing with china diplomatically. %$* 177
financial world. %$* 177
new york um, you can walk down the street here and throw a rock in any direction, you're going to hit a trillion dollars in hedge funds. %$* 177
um the shanghai bank still don’t have check-clearing mechanisms for private accounts. %$* 177
china’s moving ahead in, in the financial world. %$* 177
they’ve got a trillion dollar foreign exchange surplus and they’re in fact putting together a hundred twenty billion dollar hedge fund. %$* 177
but they are going to have to dependent on the u.s.and our financial system and cooperating with us for their money to be deployed well as well as the capital they need. %$* 177
education. %$* 177
rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america china’s built seven hundred universities in the last fifteen years. %$* 177

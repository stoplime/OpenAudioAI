so, please let's welcome now to the stage the chairman of intelligence squared u.s., mr. %$* 13
bob rosenkranz. %$* 13
hi, john. %$* 1
so, bob, this one, "declinists be damned: bet on america," what-- %$* 13
how did we get to this one? %$* 13
well for one thing it's a very special occasion because-- %$* 1
i don't know if you said this in your warm-up but this is our 100th debate. %$* 1
that's amazing. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13
i did not say that because i wanted you to get that line and that applause. %$* 13
that is very kind. %$* 1
that all worked out. %$* 13
good. %$* 1
so but why this topic, bet on america? %$* 1
well, it seemed to us really appropriate for our 100th because so many of the debates that we've done over the past six years have been on topics that really are central to whether america is a power in decline or a power in the ascendancy. %$* 1
so, we've debated topics like higher education. %$* 1
we've debated topics like inner city schools and the role of teachers' unions. %$* 1
we've debated topics on the economy, on income inequality, for example, on foreign policy, on america's proper role in the world, whether it should be the world's policeman or whether it should clip its global wings, to pick the titles of two debates. %$* 1
we've talked about health care, which is certainly one of the largest public policy challenges that the country faces, income inequality, and so forth. %$* 1
so, so many of the basic ingredients of whether america is coping well or poorly with the challenges of the 21st century are debates that we've held in the past that have been very exciting, that have engaged a very broad audience, and it seemed like for the 100th it might be really nice to have something that's so broad that it can encompass a lot of those themes and a lot of those ideas. %$* 1
so, this is the meta debate in a sense. %$* 13
in a sense it is, and we're really proud to be doing it. %$* 1
and something that we have done intentionally in a debate about betting on america is we've made sure that at least half of our panel is not american. %$* 13
well, that's part of the view of-- %$* 1
bringing different points of view to the stage. %$* 1
well, let's welcome our debaters to the stage and thank bob rosenkranz. %$* 13
thank you, john. %$* 1
so, as i said we are-- %$* 13
we are going to be broadcasting ultimately as-- %$* 13
we're livestreaming now but we will be broadcasting ultimately as a podcast and a radio show. %$* 13
and for that reason unless you're actually live tweeting, which we're delighted to have you do-- %$* 13
our hashtag will come up on the screen in just a second for tonight's debate as well as our handle, which is @iq2us-- %$* 13
we'd ask that you shut down your phones so that it's not your phone that an npr listener hears ringing in idaho several weeks from now. %$* 13
and i just heard my own phone go off in my pocket, so that's what reminded me. %$* 13
so i appreciate that. %$* 13
and, again, just to launch the whole thing, i'd like to invite one more round of applause to bob rosenkranz, and we'll get started. %$* 13
hello, i'm john donvan. %$* 13
welcome to intelligence squared u.s. "as a city upon a hill-- %$* 13
" a scriptural metaphor that was beloved by both john f. kennedy and ronald reagan to describe this project called, "america"-- %$* 13
but at various times, and this is one of them, we have heard it said that the city upon a hill is actually going downhill. %$* 13
and in a time when the middleclass is shrinking and when events overseas are not going according to american wishes and plans, the question comes up again, and that question is, has america peaked? %$* 13
are we on the downhill path or is that all just a lot of chicken little stuff? %$* 13
well, that sounds like the makings of a debate. %$* 13
so, let's have it, "yes," or, "no," to this statement, "declinists be damned: bet on america," a debate from intelligence squared u.s. and this is our 100th debate. %$* 13
we're at the kaufman music center in new york city. %$* 13
we have four superbly qualified debaters-- %$* 13
two of them are americans, and two of them are our honored guests from other lands-- %$* 13
to argue for and against this motion, "declinists be damned: bet on america." as always, our debate goes in three rounds, and then our live audience here in new york votes to choose the winner, and only one side wins. %$* 13
again, our motion is "declinists be damned: bet on america." let's meet the team arguing for the motion, arguing to bet on america. %$* 13
please, ladies and gentlemen, let's first welcome george joffe. %$* 13
josef? %$* 13
josef, i'm going to-- %$* 13
josef, josef, i gave you the wrong cue and i need you to sit down, because that's the wrong cue. %$* 13
josef just got off – never again george, because his name is not george. %$* 13
his name is josef and that's why for the radio broadcast, thanks to the magic of editing-- %$* 13
which has saved my career on more than one occasion. %$* 13
and it also means that all of you are sworn to secrecy when you leave tonight not to tell anyone what i just did. %$* 13
i'm going to once again say ladies and gentlemen, let's please welcome josef joffe. %$* 13
josef joffe, you are the publisher and editor of the german weekly die zeit and you are a senior fellow at stanford. %$* 13
you grew up in cold war west berlin, but in 1961 you ended up in grand rapids, michigan, and you went to high school there. %$* 13
and i want to know, does that have something to do with your quite favorable view of the united states? %$* 13
absolutely. %$* 188
first of all, because it was a hot shower every day, which i wasn't used to in berlin. %$* 188
second, root beer floats. %$* 188
fifteen cent hamburgers and 28 flavors of baskin robbins. %$* 188
what more could you want? %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, welcome the pro-america josef joffe. %$* 13
and josef, who is your debating partner tonight? %$* 13
well, don't you know his name? %$* 188
i do. %$* 13
obviously i'm having problems with that. %$* 13
i don't know how to pronounce it. %$* 188
peter, that's easy. %$* 188
peter zeihan, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 13
ziehan or zeihan? %$* 188
peter zeihan, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 13
welcome to our stage. %$* 13
peter, you're also arguing for the motion declinists be damned: bet on america. %$* 13
you're a geopolitical strategist. %$* 13
you helped launch the global intelligence company stratfor and then you started your own firm. %$* 13
it's called-- %$* 13
actually i don’t have the name right here. %$* 13
what's the name of it? %$* 13
zeihan on geopolitics. %$* 189
zeihan on geopolitics. %$* 13
and you also wrote the book that i do have "the accidental super power," that super power being this one, the united states. %$* 13
and in your introduction you clarify that this book is not about what should happen, but what will happen, and does that mean you're really saying that maybe the u.s. does not deserve the place at the top? %$* 13
better lucky than good. %$* 189
okay. %$* 13
that's the team arguing for the motion: bet on america. %$* 13
and the motion has opponents as well. %$* 13
arguing not to bet on america. %$* 13
declinists be damned: bet on america. %$* 13
they're taking the opposite position. %$* 13
two debaters. %$* 13
first, let's please welcome chrystia freeland. %$* 13
chrystia, interesting career and recent career move. %$* 13
you're a journalist. %$* 13
you have worked as u.s. managing editor of "the financial times," managing editor-- %$* 13
director and editor of consumer news at reuters, but in 2013 you left journalism to become a member of parliament in canada. %$* 13
you are on the side against this motion: bet on america. %$* 13
i thought canadians were supposed to be our friends. %$* 13
we are your friends. %$* 190
we love america. %$* 190
and it's the job of the best friend to say, “you know what? %$* 190
you need to raise your game a little bit.” %$* 190
thank you, chrystia freeland. %$* 13
and do you know your partner's name? %$* 13
i do know my partner's name. %$* 190
i love my partner and his work and he is the brilliant jim rickards. %$* 190
ladies and gentlemen, jim rickards. %$* 13
jim, you're also arguing against the motion declinists be damned: bet on america. %$* 13
you're a portfolio manager. %$* 13
you're a lawyer. %$* 13
you're an economist. %$* 13
you've written some best sellers, including "the death of money." this is interesting. %$* 13
you have also advised the u.s.intelligence community and the department of defense on capital markets and strategy and defense of those. %$* 13
are they as worried as you are about our financial future? %$* 13
they are worried about it, but unfortunately they have very little to say about it. %$* 191
that's left to the treasury and the fed. %$* 191
so, the people who are most concerned are the least involved. %$* 191
oh, well, that doesn't work out very well. %$* 13
but i guess we'll hear more about that as the debate continues. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, these are our debaters. %$* 13
now this is a debate. %$* 13
one team will win and one team will lose, and that will be decided by you, our live audience in new york. %$* 13
by the time the debate has ended you will have been asked to vote twice, once before the debate and once again after the debate and the teams whose numbers have changed the most in percentage point terms between the two votes will be declared our winner. %$* 13
our motion is declinists be damned: bet on america. %$* 13
let's register your first vote on this. %$* 13
if you go to the keypads at your seat. %$* 13
you see a bunch of numbers. %$* 13
only pay attention to one, two, and three. %$* 13
if you agree with this motion at this point, bet on america, push number 1.and if you disagree, push number 2.and if you're undecided, push number 3.you can ignore the other keys. %$* 13
they're not live. %$* 13
and you can correct an incorrect vote just by pushing the button and it'll lock in your last vote. %$* 13
we'll lock out in just a minute-- %$* 13
less than a minute. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
that's locked out? %$* 13
let's move on to round 1.round 1, opening statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
they are uninterrupted. %$* 13
they will be seven minutes each. %$* 13
our motion is declinists be damned: bet on america. %$* 13
and here to speak in support of this motion, joe joffe. %$* 13
he is publisher and editor of die zeit and author of "the myth of america's decline: politics, economics, and half a century of false prophecies." ladies and gentlemen, josef joffe. %$* 13
america as a has-been is the oldest story in the book. %$* 188
even right after the revolution, the famous american-- %$* 188
french statesman talleyrand dumped on the united states by saying it's a country with 30 religions and just one dish to eat. %$* 188
little did he know that a bit later, like today, that one dish would blanket the world with 35,000 mcdonalds. %$* 188
decline is not a real serious diagnosis. %$* 188
it's repertoire theater. %$* 188
today, we are in decline 5.0.we've had four before. %$* 188
and various candidates-- %$* 188
russia, europe, japan-- %$* 188
were about to overtake the united states, leave the united states in the dust, and now it is the soviet-- %$* 188
it is china. %$* 188
these prophecies did not pan out because they confused the headlines with the long-term trend. %$* 188
exhibit a for every declinist is the economy, where others are always said to be growing faster. %$* 188
but here's the surprise. %$* 188
for the last 50 years, the u.s.share of the global gdp has held steady, around 25, 26 percent. %$* 188
in the same period, the e.u.lost 11 points, japan more than two. %$* 188
and russia has cut its share in half. %$* 188
so, who's declining, if i may ask? %$* 188
let's put it this way. %$* 188
if rome, starting some 2000 years ago, had been declining at america's rate, we would be debating in latin today. %$* 188
now, a certain measure of power is military spending. %$* 188
the u.s.is in a league of its own. %$* 188
it spends almost four times more than china, seven times more than russia, 12 times more than japan. %$* 188
it spends as much as the next nine countries together, five of whom, by the way, are allies. %$* 188
what does all this cash buy? %$* 188
the short answer is that the u.s. navy is as large as the next 12 navies together. %$* 188
in its heyday, britain only wanted to be twice as strong as the next one. %$* 188
so, only the united states can intervene anywhere in the world, nobody else can. %$* 188
like those b-2 stealth bombers that took off in missouri, dropped a load on libya, and returned home in one trip. %$* 188
now, that's a snapshot, our opponents will say-- %$* 188
will say. %$* 188
the others will inevitably overtake the united states, because they're growing-- %$* 188
they're rising. %$* 188
do you mean russia, with an economy that's one-tenth the size of america? %$* 188
or china, which has a per capita one-eighth of america? %$* 188
china-- %$* 188
china, you will say, "look, they came from nowhere. %$* 188
they're now number 2." but the days of china's spectacular growth are over. %$* 188
it's one half of what it once was. %$* 188
and this is no accident-- %$* 188
the chinese growth model is like japan's, and taiwan's, and south korea-- %$* 188
all of them have come down. %$* 188
the-- %$* 188
and so, there is something inherently wrong with this model. %$* 188
we'll talk about it later. %$* 188
so, the-- %$* 188
the-- %$* 188
they would say, "but what about the chinese labor force? %$* 188
" well, the chinese advantage is gone, too. %$* 188
productivity has not kept up with the explosion of wages. %$* 188
in manufacturing, the wage gap with the u.s.has almost disappeared. %$* 188
and worse, this year, the chinese labor supply will begin to shrink due to rapid aging. %$* 188
the u.s., on the other hand, will be the youngest nation in the industrialized world. %$* 188
let's think about future. %$* 188
what drives growth in the future? %$* 188
well, factor number one is higher education. %$* 188
did you know that of the top 20 universities, 17 are american? %$* 188
the first chinese university shows up in the 100 to 150 bracket. %$* 188
you look at-- %$* 188
you look at citations in scientific journals. %$* 188
you look at patents. %$* 188
the gap between the u.s.and china is just as wide as the pacific. %$* 188
so and but the greatest-- %$* 188
the greatest american advantage is the power of immigration. %$* 188
china and russia, closed societies, don't even think about immigration. %$* 188
but here, as you know, from the very beginning the tide continues to flow in. %$* 188
why do i harp on immigration? %$* 188
because it keeps the country not only young but also from freezing up. %$* 188
immigration breaks privilege and fuels competition. %$* 188
there's always another group that pushes in, works harder, and rises to the top. %$* 188
the newcomers keep bringing ambition and skill as they have done for the-- %$* 188
for 300 years. %$* 188
try to become a chinese. %$* 188
i want to become a chinese. %$* 188
it's easy to become an american. %$* 188
here, i'll tell you how to do it. %$* 188
i celebrate 4th of july and thanksgiving. %$* 188
i joined the pta and coach little league. %$* 188
i stopped smoking. %$* 188
i buy an suv and shop till i drop. %$* 188
the serious point is anybody can sign up to the american creed. %$* 188
and, "where did you go to school? %$* 188
" beats, "where do you come from? %$* 188
" any time. %$* 188
as a chechnyan you'll never become a real russian, but sergey brin could come here from russia and start google. %$* 188
did you know that one half of silicon valley's engineers were born abroad? %$* 188
two-fifths of all startups in the valley built two years ago were founded by immigrants, vladivostok or kyoto or even madrid. %$* 188
immigration is the inexhaustible source of rejuvenation, bringing in the world's best and brightest. %$* 188
that's the moral of this tale. %$* 188
let me ask-- %$* 188
end with a surprise confession. %$* 188
i actually like this american obsession with decline. %$* 188
it’s part of the country's religion of self-improvement-- %$* 188
an offshoot of the prophetic tradition. %$* 188
isaiah: beware of sloth, pride. %$* 188
look at your own flaws, and keep on hustling. %$* 188
declinism is the best antidote to decline. %$* 188
but declinism is repertoire theater, like a good scare, like another sequel to "nightmare on elm street." where are soviet russia, europe, japan today? %$* 188
where is 15 percent growth of china? %$* 188
the truth is, only one nation can do an america, and that is america itself. %$* 188
and that's why i like this declinist agitation. %$* 188
it will make sure it won't happen. %$* 188
so, to repeat from-- %$* 188
i've been going downhill at the american rate, we would be debating in latin today, like “gratias which means, "thank you, and see you in the next round." %$* 188
thank you. %$* 13
thank you joe joffe. %$* 13
and that's our motion, "declinists be damned: bet on america."and here to argue against the motion, chrystia freeland. %$* 13
she is a member of the canadian parliament and author of the book, "plutocrats: the rise of the new global super-rich and the fall of everyone else." ladies and gentlemen, chrystia freeland. %$* 13
thank you very much, john. %$* 190
it's great to be here tonight. %$* 190
as john said, i'm an mp.i debate in a westminster-style parliament. %$* 190
so, i am used to all sorts of rhetorical dirty tricks from the honorable members, the opposite side of the aisle. %$* 190
and i wanted to start by warning you about what i thought were going to be the fiendish rhetorical moves tried out by the other guys. %$* 190
so, here are the three things i want you to beware of and not to be misled by. %$* 190
the first one is-- %$* 190
and it's the tough thing about debating our side of this question-- %$* 190
that in voting for our side, which is the correct one, you are going to be accused of being insufficiently patriotic. %$* 190
and efforts are going to be made to impugn your love of the united states. %$* 190
don't fall for that one. %$* 190
the highest form of patriotism is to see clearly what's happening in your country. %$* 190
the second one, which i'm sad to say we've already heard a lot from in joe's beautiful, eloquent presentation, is what i call the cleanest dirty shirt argument. %$* 190
and this is the defense of the united states which basically says, "okay, we may have our problems, but everybody else is worse. %$* 190
look at those europeans. %$* 190
look at those japanese. %$* 190
look at those russians. %$* 190
look at those chinese." we're not debating here, "is the u.s. in less trouble than the world's other countries? %$* 190
" we're debating, "is the u.s. in decline, relative to where it has been? %$* 190
"and you know what? %$* 190
you guys have a responsibility to be super good. %$* 190
you are the last remaining superpower. %$* 190
we need you to be morally, intellectually, and, in terms of world authority, better than everybody else. %$* 190
so, just to be a little bit less bad, that's not good enough. %$* 190
so, why do we believe-- %$* 190
and we say this with real sadness-- %$* 190
why do we fear that america is in decline? %$* 190
the first evidence is what's happening internationally. %$* 190
in the cold war era and then following the collapse of the soviet union, we lived in a time of what you might call the pax americana. %$* 190
and as a canadian it was a great time. %$* 190
it wasn't just a great time for america. %$* 190
it was a great time for the world. %$* 190
unfortunately, we're seeing america pulling back. %$* 190
we're seeing that on big issues like climate change, a huge-- %$* 190
there's lots of kids here. %$* 190
we need to be fixing this for you guys. %$* 190
where's american global leadership on this issue? %$* 190
we're seeing in a place like syria, there was a red line, the red line was crossed, what happened? %$* 190
and we're seeing it most acutely-- %$* 190
and this is something i'm just so terrified about-- %$* 190
in russia and ukraine. %$* 190
joe pointed out, and he is quite right, the russian economy is one-tenth the size of the u.s.economy. %$* 190
so, how come putin is getting away with redrawing the borders of europe and no one, least of all the united states-- %$* 190
the u.s.isn't even at the minsk peace talks right now. %$* 190
is that not a superpower in decline? %$* 190
and this is bad news for the whole world because superpowers, as bob kagan wrote very brilliantly, are not allowed to retire. %$* 190
second argument is your political gridlock. %$* 190
and here i think we would all agree that the genius of america is the ingenuity of the american people. %$* 190
it's what each individual person does, and that is fantastic. %$* 190
but i think we would all also agree there's a role from time to time for government to do a few things. %$* 190
joe talked movingly, and i totally agree with him, about immigration being such a strength in america. %$* 190
you guys have a few problems to sort out with that, and you're going to need government to act, and i don't see government acting. %$* 190
now, you may say, "it was ever thus. %$* 190
washington has always been a mess." i'm a politician. %$* 190
i know what people say about politicians. %$* 190
but sarah binder of brookings did a study last year, and she found that the likelihood of congressional gridlock on a given issue has doubled over the past 65 years. %$* 190
your government is ineffective at a time when you need effective government for yourselves and for the world. %$* 190
finally, and this to me is the biggest problem, this is the thing that really keeps me up at night, democratic capitalism, that great u.s.model, isn't working the way it used to and the way it is supposed to. %$* 190
for the past 30 years, the u.s.middle class has been hammered. %$* 190
wages have stagnated, and wealth has stagnated or declined, while the people at the very top have seen their incomes and wealth skyrocket. %$* 190
that is a huge problem for the united states because the u.s. promise, as joe so eloquently said, is "if you work hard and play by the rules, you can succeed." but that is not what the u.s. economy today is delivering, and that's why gridlock is such a problem because it is going to take a massive, united social effort and really inspired, brilliant leadership to resolve this economic conundrum, which i believe is a challenge comparable to the challenge presented by the industrial revolution. %$* 190
now, you may say to me, "well, but isn't this a problem that all the western industrialized economies face to some degree or another? %$* 190
" and i would agree with you. %$* 190
it's a thing we're worried about in canada, too. %$* 190
but this income inequality is worse in the u.s.than in any other western industrialized country. %$* 190
your elites are doing better, and your middle class is more hammered. %$* 190
did you know that working men, so men between 20 and 50, the employment rate of men in that group in the u.s. is lower than in france? %$* 190
that's a problem. %$* 190
i want to conclude with a quote. %$* 190
this is from thomas jefferson. %$* 190
he wrote, "we have no paupers. %$* 190
the great mass of our population is of laborers. %$* 190
our rich, who can live without labor, either manual or professional, being few and of moderate wealth. %$* 190
most of the laboring classes possess property, cultivate their own lands, have families, and from the demand for their labor are entitled to exact from the rich and the competent such prices as enable them to be fed abundantly, clothed, and to raise their families." %$* 190
i'll finish it next time. %$* 190
chrystia freeland. %$* 13
i'm sorry. %$* 13
your time is up, but thank you very much. %$* 13
i'll finish it next time. %$* 190
and the reminder of what's going on. %$* 13
we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two arguing it out over this motion: declinists be damned: bet on america. %$* 13
you have heard from the first two debaters and now onto the third. %$* 13
here to argue in support of the motion declinists be damned: bet on america, peter zeihan. %$* 13
he's a geopolitical strategist and he is author of the book "the accidental superpower: the next generation of american preeminence and the coming global disorder."ladies and gentlemen, peter zeihan. %$* 13
i considered declining this invitation when it was made. %$* 189
npr intellectual is not really my crowd. %$* 189
i live in texas. %$* 189
but then i realized that the word “damn” was in the proposition so i'd be allowed to swear. %$* 189
on npr. a lot. %$* 189
so, here i am. %$* 13
but enough about my hopes and dreams. %$* 13
let's talk about you. %$* 13
where are my boomers? %$* 13
people born 1946 to 1964.come on. %$* 13
hands up, yeah, yeah, yeah. %$* 13
you guys are a freakin' army. %$* 13
you're the largest generation we've ever had. %$* 13
you need to tell the radio audience how many people put hands up. %$* 13
oh, it's like a third of the total, but we've got a lot of youngsters up top. %$* 189
so, you know, it's a swarm. %$* 189
most of your consumption, however, is behind you. %$* 189
your kids have left home. %$* 189
the house is paid for. %$* 189
you're at the height of your tax-paying experience, which means that the government's like, “i'll take some of that, and then i'll take some more.”today's budget battles, that's the start of our debate about figuring out not how to pay things with your money, but about how to pay your retirement without your money. %$* 189
something to look forward to. %$* 189
which sucks for this next group. %$* 189
where are my gen-y? %$* 189
or excuse me, gen-x.gen-x.oh, we're all here. %$* 189
yeah, we're the smallest generation as a percentage of the population. %$* 189
so very soon it will be up to us, all 11 of us,-- %$* 189
to pay for 75 million retiring boomers. %$* 189
taxes are going to be awful, but it's not quite as bad as it seems. %$* 189
because while the boomers are so convinced that they're so special, there's actually a boomer class globally that relative to the population is about 20 percent larger than it is here. %$* 189
so, yes we do have a boomer donculous tax bill just around the corner, but it's actually considerably less than what everyone else is going to have to pay. %$* 189
so, you know, not exactly hope, but you know, schadenfreude. %$* 189
and then there's gen-y.gen-y folks, you know, the millennials. %$* 189
oh, a few of you showed up tonight. %$* 189
that's great. %$* 189
your age group does the consuming. %$* 189
kids, houses, cars, pot. %$* 189
it's-- %$* 189
spend, spend, spend. %$* 189
your purchases, especially the pot, by the way, are why the economy is doing so well right now. %$* 189
because of you, because of your bulk, the united states is going to be the youngest developing-- %$* 189
excuse me, developed country in the world in just four years, younger than china. %$* 189
and in 15 years when you have matured, and i use that term in the loosest possible way-- %$* 189
you will swarm into the taxpaying class with a fervor that gen x just could've never matched. %$* 189
and gen x will be settling into the tardis-like space that the boomers will be vacating and america's 20-year effort to digest the boomer demography will finally be over. %$* 189
now, as an x-er it really pains me to say this, but you gen-y-ers are special. %$* 189
because there are no german y's or japanese y's or italian or canadian y's. %$* 189
it's as if the entire developed world forgot how to have kids around 1975 and i think we've all traveled enough to know they got the basics down. %$* 189
this combination of bigger global boomer cadre, but no global y cadre spells disaster. %$* 189
consumer activity and tax income will shrink every single year. %$* 189
retiree costs will increase every single year. %$* 189
it's a deflationary spiral with no escape and it will happen everywhere but the united states. %$* 189
and that's the good news. %$* 189
let's talk about the bad news. %$* 189
let's talk about trade. %$* 189
the idea that you can trade with a country a quarter, a third, halfway around the world, that's a very strange idea. %$* 189
until recently, major countries used their navies to protect trade between their colonies and their mainland. %$* 189
you didn't trade with your neighbor if you could avoid it, because you never knew when someone might throw a war, and you lose access to everything. %$* 189
these separate imperial systems clashed, and those clashes culminated in world war ii.now, at the end of that war, the united states forced all of its allies to sit down, and we imposed a new economic system upon the world. %$* 189
we called it free trade. %$* 189
we told them they didn't need navies. %$* 189
we would patrol the global oceans and allow them to send whatever they wanted anywhere to anyone at anytime. %$* 189
in addition, we would open our market-- %$* 189
the only consumer market survived the war-- %$* 189
so, they could export their ways back to affluence. %$* 189
in exchange, there was one demand. %$* 189
this alliance would fight the cold war our way. %$* 189
you heard that right. %$* 189
we bribed up an alliance to take on the soviets. %$* 189
and it worked. %$* 189
free trade created the free world. %$* 189
europe united. %$* 189
japan rebuilt. %$* 189
china modernized. %$* 189
the global population tripled. %$* 189
global gdp increased by a factor of 10. one-third of the chinese and italian gdp-- %$* 189
export-driven. %$* 189
the eu? %$* 189
the chinese communist party? %$* 189
all of that would have been impossible without the safe and reliable access to the global oceans and the u.s.market. %$* 189
which leads us to the world's most inconvenient truth-- %$* 189
the united states didn't create free trade as an economic plan, but as a strategic gambit. %$* 189
we don't use free trade's economic features. %$* 189
our exports-- %$* 189
9 percent of gdp, the lowest in the world by a significant margin. %$* 189
we are the least integrated country out there. %$* 189

i'd like to thank all of you for coming and to introduce the founder and chairman of intelligence squared u.s., mr. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
thank you very much, and welcome to the first debate of our fall season. %$* 1
we're excited to be back and pleased to see such a nice turnout. %$* 1
this crowd was not terrorized by the weather. %$* 1
this is our 51st debate, but it's our first with slate as our media partner and our first for our new relationship with pbs and wnet as our television outlet. %$* 1
we're delighted to have such first class partners, joining our effort to improve the quality of our public discourse. %$* 1
so to our resolution tonight, "it's time to end the war on terror." ideologically, the appeal of terrorism as a way to redress grievances has been undermined. %$* 1
the arab spring has accomplished far more through largely peaceful means than al-qaeda ever accomplished through violence. %$* 1
tactically, the balance has shifted. %$* 1
osama bin laden was uniquely charismatic and inspirational, with large financial resources. %$* 1
now he's dead as are most of his lieutenants. %$* 1
al-qaeda's leadership is fractured; its communications primitive; its financing highly constrained; and its operational capabilities severely limited. %$* 1
we achieved this result by expending enormous resources for intelligence surveillance, drone attacks and brilliantly coordinated raids, but the al-qaeda war was never going to be ended by a peace treaty. %$* 1
history, however, has moved on; and it's time for us to move on as well. %$* 1
the war on terror no longer makes sense as an organizing principle for u.s. policy. %$* 1
but what's the counter argument to all of this? %$* 1
it is that we cannot simply declare victory and shift our concerns elsewhere. %$* 1
terrorist attacks are still occurring with depressing frequency in iraq and afghanistan. %$* 1
pakistan's duplicity has been exposed, but it remains a nuclear power with destabilizing, radical islamic elements. %$* 1
suicide bombers are still an asymmetric threat and a tactic to be reckoned with. %$* 1
america's hated as much as ever by islamic jihadists who certainly have the desire to inflict mass casualties on us through whatever means they can obtain. %$* 1
this is not the time to bask in the glow of victory but rather the time to maintain the vigilance that has kept us safe during the decade we're about to mark this week. %$* 1
but which is the better argument? %$* 1
it's up to you to decide; and to help you make that decision, we've assembled an extraordinary panel of experts. %$* 1
before i turn the evening over to them and to our moderator john donvan, i'd like to invite jacob weisberg, editor and chief of the slate group to say a word. %$* 1
bob, thank you. %$* 126
we at slate couldn't be more excited about becoming intelligence squared's media partner. %$* 126
you know, from our start which is 15 years ago, slate's been all about the value of debate and conversation, the dialogue that the web allows you to have instead of what you might think of as the monologue in print. %$* 126
and i've seen that same approach embodied in the intelligence squared debates, both as a participant-- %$* 126
which, to my relief, i'm not tonight-- %$* 126
and as a member of the audience. %$* 126
like slate, intelligence squared is committed to the view that serious argument can be entertaining and that ideas and policy can be fun. %$* 126
on our site, we're hoping to extend these conversations in both directions. %$* 126
we're going to run pieces, articles to help frame the subjects in advance; and we want to continue the conversation after the event is over. %$* 126
this isn't the only debate we'll be covering, but we have a reporter here tonight in case you want to read tomorrow and read a journalist's take on what took place. %$* 126
i should say we've had a terrific time already working with bob, with dana wolfe and their amazing team to help craft the propositions for the fall season; and we hope we've got a roster of ones that will prove both urgent and engaging. %$* 126
so the subject we're starting out with tonight, which bob framed extremely well, couldn't be more vital in its importance to the city of new york, to the country and to the world. %$* 126
so i don't want to delay it any further. %$* 126
i will turn it over to get things under way. %$* 126
it's my privilege to give you john donvan. %$* 126
thank you. %$* 13
thank you, jacob. %$* 13
and jacob, you were a very good debater, by the way. %$* 13
so i'd just like to invite one more round of applause for robert rosenkranz and jacob weisberg. %$* 13
true or false: "it is time to end the war on terror." that's what we are here to debate. %$* 13
this is another verbal match-up from intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
we're at the skirball center for the performing arts at new york university and on hundreds of npr stations across the nation. %$* 13
"it's time to end the war on terror." two teams will be arguing that proposition from opposite sides for it and against it. %$* 13
and all of our debaters come at this topic from firsthand experience. %$* 13
they include security expert peter bergen, who as a journalist, interviewed osama bin laden in 1997 and sent out some of the earliest warning signals. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, peter bergen. %$* 13
peter, we're doing a preliminary introduction and then-- %$* 13
you know what? %$* 13
you know what? %$* 13
peter did exactly what we asked him to do. %$* 13
but we forgot to tell him it was going to happen twice. %$* 13
and that's our fault. %$* 13
my apologies. %$* 13
his debating partner, juliette kayyem, who in the obama administration was an assistant secretary for homeland security. %$* 13
opposing them at the facing table, mike hayden, who ran the cia and before that, the national security agency-- %$* 13
and richard falkenrath, who advised president bush on homeland security, then moved to new york city to become deputy commissioner of counterterrorism. %$* 13
so all four of these people know what they are talking about, and yet they disagree on calling an end to the war on terror. %$* 13
all of them are dedicated to winning you over to their point of view here in our live audience because you, our live audience, are the judges in this debate, and that's what this is. %$* 13
it is a contest. %$* 13
there will be winners and losers. %$* 13
and in this contest, you will decide who wins. %$* 13
we're going to ask you, by the time the debate has been concluded, to vote twice-- %$* 13
once before and once again afterwards; and the team that has changed its numbers the most, changed most of your minds, will be named our winner. %$* 13
so let's go first to the preliminary vote. %$* 13
you each have keypads at your seats. %$* 13
our motion is this. %$* 13
"it's time to end the war on terror." if you agree with this proposition, push number one. %$* 13
if you disagree, push number two; and if you're undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and if you feel that you made an error in the process, just correct it, and the system will lock in your most recent vote. %$* 13
it looks like everybody's done. %$* 13
so to remind you again, that vote will be tabulated immediately, but we'll hold the result till the end of the debate to tell what you that base number is; and then we'll have you vote once again at the end of the evening, and the team that has changed the most minds will be declared out winner. %$* 13
so on to the debate, round one, opening statements from each debater in turn. %$* 13
our motion is this: "it's time to end the war on terror." and speaking first for the motion, i'd like to introduce peter bergen, a cnn national security analyst. %$* 13
he's director of national security studies at the new america foundation and a best-selling author. %$* 13
in 1997, he traveled to afghanistan and conducted osama bin laden's first television interview. %$* 13
and peter, i just want to share with you the fact that even your opponents can see that your knowledge of the operational details of terrorist groups is encyclopedic. %$* 13
i don't know if that's a psych-out-- %$* 13
or not, but i hope you can take it as a compliment. %$* 13
i do. %$* 91
okay. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, peter bergen. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 91
first of all, juliette and i wanted to acknowledge the three and a half decades of public service that general hayden has done and also richard falkenrath's more than a decade of public service. %$* 91
i also wanted to acknowledge juliette kayyem's decade and a half of public service where she became the highest ranking arab-american in the obama administration, the assistant secretary to the department of homeland security. %$* 91
she also had three kids that she raised at the same time, putting home into homeland security in a meaningful sense-- %$* 91
and is one of the world's leading experts on the question of homeland security. %$* 91
my own connection to the story came when the trade center was bombed for the first time in '93. i traveled to afghanistan, produced a documentary about the threat we face from afghanistan and then, of course, interviewed bin laden. %$* 91
i've written three books on the subject of al-qaeda. %$* 91
i've embedded with our troops on multiple occasions in iraq and afghanistan. %$* 91
from a self-interested point of view, i have every incentive to say the threat that al-qaeda and terrorism poses to us remains very serious. %$* 91
and it merits on open-ended conflict against them; but in good conscience, i simply can't make that argument. %$* 91
war is no longer the most appropriate way to look at the problems we face today. %$* 91
our singular focus on terrorism also masks many more pressing problems. %$* 91
our crumbling infrastructure, our decaying schools, deeply serious economic problems. %$* 91
another national security problem is managing the future of the arab spring, for instance; preventing nuclear war between pakistan and india; preventing a nuclear war between north korea and south korea; managing the rise of china which, while we’ve been distracted by the war on terror, has quietly expanded its influence in africa and in southeast asia. %$* 91
our opponents want to prolong the war on terror, an open-ended conflict against a tactic that is already america's longest war. %$* 91
we're saying it's time for war to end. %$* 91
president obama correctly redefined this conflict downwards from a global open-ended conflict against the tactic to the more precise formulation of a war against al-qaeda and its allies, which both names the enemy and narrows the focus of the conflict. %$* 91
when we say it's time for the war on terror to end, we don't mean we should precipitously pull out of afghanistan, but we do mean that it's time to stop conceiving our principle national security goal as the defeat of terrorists when putting, for instance, our own economic house in order will do far more to prepare us for the next real war we'll inevitably face at some point in the future. %$* 91
the war on terror, as everybody in the audience knows, has caused the american public at least a trillion dollars in expenditure and wars around the world and, of course, got us into the catastrophic iraq war; further trillions on our-- %$* 91
both our intelligence and homeland national security apparatus resulted in policies such as coercive interrogations and extraordinary renditions. %$* 91
and you'll hear from my partner that the government has for years anyway moved away from the war on terror and what it entails, not because there was no threat. %$* 91
we're not claiming that at all but because the threat has changed and has adapted and so we must-- %$* 91
we as well. %$* 91
key american national security officials now say that al-qaeda's on its last leg. %$* 91
john brennan, who, of course, is president obama's chief counterterrorism adviser, said that just last week. %$* 91
leon panetta said that the strategic defeat of al-qaeda is within sight. %$* 91
general david petraeus has made the same sort of comments recently. %$* 91
none of these gentlemen can be considered to be defeatist or soft on terrorism. %$* 91
so is this premature triumphalism the claim that al-qaeda is on its last legs? %$* 91
well, i think the claim is well-justified. %$* 91
i mean, the leadership of al-qaeda's been completely decimated in the campaign of drone attacks. %$* 91
the most dangerous job in the world right now has been al-qaeda's number two. %$* 91
there have been about 20 of them since 2008, including most recently, the group's number two out here, atiyah abd al-rahman, who was killed just a few weeks-- %$* 91
just about a week ago. %$* 91
al-qaeda hasn't carried out a successful attack in the west since the 7/7 attacks in london six years ago. %$* 91
al-qaeda hasn't killed a single american in the united states since 9/11. %$* 91
and think about the real wars we've really confronted. %$* 91
the civil war threatened to tear this country apart. %$* 91
world war ii, we defeated an enemy that instigated a global conflict to kill tens of millions, and if the cold war had ended with a bang instead of whimper, we'd all be not in this debate because we'd all be dead. %$* 91
those are serious threats. %$* 91
the war on terror-- %$* 91
the threat we faced from al-qaeda doesn't come close; and in fact, only 17 americans have died as a result of al-qaeda's ideological ideas in this country, 13 of them, of course, at fort hood and others in other places. %$* 91
more americans accidentally die in their own bathtubs every year by considerable numbers around 300, and we don't have an unreasonable fear of bathtubs; so we shouldn't have an unreasonable fear of al-qaeda. %$* 91
and by terrorism we're terrified, by the way, of course, and we're doing the job of the terrorist for them if we live in this state of constant fear that our opponents wish us to live in. %$* 91
and everybody in the audience knows very well that the threat from terrorism is actually dramatically receded in the years since the 9/11 attacks; and that's in part because al-qaeda and bin laden have been losing the war of ideas in the muslim world for years. %$* 91
their founder and leader was killed, as you know, in abbottabad on the evening of may 1st. %$* 91
in the arab spring, there's not a single revolutionary who's carrying a single picture of osama bin laden. %$* 91
bin laden's ideas have been completely absent from the arab spring. %$* 91
there hasn't been a single flag burning in the arab spring of an american flag or even an israeli flag; so bin laden's foot soldiers, ideas and leadership are simply absent from this enormously important phenomenon in the arab world. %$* 91
our opponents may claim that we're still threatened by terrorists armed with weapons of mass destruction. %$* 91
this claim, of course, follows simply the disastrous war in iraq; and in fact, the 188 jihadi terrorist cases in this country since 9/11, not a single one of them involved chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons. %$* 91
we will no doubt hear from our opponents that to argue the war on terrorism is overly soft or unrealistic or weak-- %$* 91
and they make claim that, at some point, we will decide we no longer need to define it as a war on terror, but we aren't there yet. %$* 91
i would submit to you in the audience, if the death of the founder and leader of al-qaeda isn't the point where we can say the war on terror is over and then add to that the destruction of almost its entire top leadership, its absence in the revolutions across the middle east, its inability to mount any kind of attack on the united states for a decade isn't the point to end the war on terror, when will that point be? %$* 91
we say it's now. %$* 91
thank you, peter bergen. %$* 13
our proposition is "it's time to end the war on terror," and here to speak against this motion, michael hayden, an air force four-star general. %$* 13
he's former director of the national security agency and the central intelligence agency. %$* 13
he has overseen virtually every branch of the intelligence community. %$* 13
he is now a principal at the chertoff group as is his debating partner, richard falkenrath. %$* 13
and i understand, mike, you have a great deal of pittsburgh in you-- %$* 13
i do? %$* 77
and that pittsburgh returned the affection by naming a highway, a stretch of highway after you. %$* 13
actually, it's a street right next to heinz field; and the first question i asked was "can i park there during football games? %$* 77
how do you work that out? %$* 13
do you just drive up and down your street all the time-- %$* 13
looking at the signs? %$* 13
take the grandkids-- %$* 77
ladies and gentlemen, michael hayden. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 77
well, good evening. %$* 77
thanks for the opportunity to talk about such an important topic, and it really is an important topic. %$* 77
it's not something that we should just decide idly. %$* 77
it's not something we should decide because we're really in a celebratory mood. %$* 77
when i-- %$* 77
when i talk to audiences about the war on terror, i generally refer to a speech i gave at the german embassy in the spring of 2007. the germans were in the chair of the european union, and the german ambassador would have the ambassadors to the united states from the european union over for lunch about every two weeks and would have an american come in to kind of be the lunchtime entertainment, and it was my turn. %$* 77
i decided that the german ambassador was a good friend, and he deserved a good speech; and i decided i would talk to the european union delegates about renditions, detentions and interrogations that were being conducted by the cia at that time. %$* 77
about page two or three of that speech, i wanted to make very clear to my audience what i thought, what my agency thought and what i think my nation thought. %$* 77
and i gave them four sentences. %$* 77
"we believe we are a nation at war." "we are at war with al-qaeda and its affiliates"-- %$* 77
the description that peter just gave and that president obama emphasized that reflected what we were thinking several years earlier. %$* 77
"a nation at war"; "at war with al-qaeda and its affiliates"; "this war is global in scope"; and "we can only fulfill our moral and ethical responsibilities to you, the citizens of this republic, by taking this fight to this enemy wherever he may be." george tenet was the dci, the director of central intelligence. %$* 77
in 1999, sent a note out to all of us in the intelligence community, saying "we're at war with al-qaeda." and george was but america wasn't. %$* 77
america went to war with al-qaeda shortly after the attacks on september 11, 2001. %$* 77
two successive american presidents have defined us as being at war with al-qaeda. %$* 77
the american congress has defined us as being at war with al-qaeda; and the american court system, only a few blocks from here, has defined us as being at war with al-qaeda when a defendant, attempting to claim he had been denied his right to a speedy trial because he had been in detention for several years, his claim was rejected by the court, saying we, as a nation at war, had a right to detain him as a combatant. %$* 77
now, we could discuss troop levels in iraq, the rate of withdrawal from afghanistan, a whole bunch of other details about this war, but that's not the point i think rich and i want to make. %$* 77
the point we want to make is the legal construct-- %$* 77
the legal belief that we are a nation at war; that we are a nation in conflict; and we have a right, because we are in that status, to use the legal tools and the legal authorities that a nation at war is allowed to use. %$* 77
what it is we're supporting is to keep all available tools on the table-- %$* 77
to keep a menu of options from law enforcement, diplomacy, or to arm conflict in order to keep you safe. %$* 77
i would also add-- %$* 77
and i really want to emphasis this-- %$* 77
that conceiving yourself at war in addition to whatever it is you might do in a law enforcement channel is not somehow lawless. %$* 77
it is perfectly lawful. %$* 77
it is a different lawful approach than a law enforcement approach, but it is consistent with the laws of armed conflict that we have a right to resort to in order to defend ourselves. %$* 77
i assume everyone here is happy that osama bin laden was killed on the morning of the second of may in pakistan. %$* 77
let me give you-- %$* 77
thank you. %$* 77
let me give you a slightly different description of that event. %$* 77
a heavily armed agent of the united states government was in a room with an unarmed man who was under indictment in the united states judicial system and was offering no significant resistance to the heavily armed agent of the united states government, and that heavily armed agent of the united states government killed him. %$* 77
if you do not think we are at war, there are some very troubling definitions that you might want to attach to that act. %$* 77
that's the kind of authority we have perfectly lawful-- %$* 77
and no way am i suggesting anyone acted inappropriately. %$* 77
we acted perfectly lawfully because we are a nation at war and generally recognized as such. %$* 77
you don't want to take those tools off the table while there are terrorists out there. %$* 77
if you let this tool go, you will be less safe. %$* 77
okay. %$* 77
if you look at the scope of our constitutional system, the law enforcement approach is designed, if you look at the constitution, the bill of rights and the american statutory law, the law enforcement approach is designed to make the government weak because we don't want the government arbitrarily taking away your liberties. %$* 77
on the other hand, if you look at those sections of the constitution that deal with armed conflict, they're designed to make the government strong so that it can protect you. %$* 77
you don't want to take that tool off the table. %$* 77
and quite perversely, if you take that tool off the table, you may actually threaten your own civil liberties. %$* 77
bear with me. %$* 77
there's a tight connection here. %$* 77
if the options of a nation at war are taken away from your tool kit, you must then rely on the options offered by law enforcement. %$* 77
if you recall the events in-- %$* 77
on christmas day a year or two ago, detroit, umar farouk abdulmutallab, the "underwear bomber"-- %$* 77
and he was mirandized after about 50 minutes of interrogation, and i think everyone recognized that was probably a mistake. %$* 77
we should have interrogated him further. %$* 77
we had the attorney general talking to the american congress about legislation that would make miranda more malleable so that we could interrogate these kinds of people longer in our law enforcement approach. %$* 77
i don't want to make miranda more malleable. %$* 77
miranda defends me. %$* 77
defends you. %$* 77
defends your rights. %$* 77
and we're forced to contort the law enforcement approach when we attempt to make it answer and deal with questions it was never designed to deal with. %$* 77
this is one of those questions. %$* 77
don't take that other tool, "we are a nation of war" off the table. %$* 77
thank you. %$* 77
thank you, michael hayden. %$* 13
our motion is "it's time to end the war on terror." we are now halfway through opening remarks of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, fighting it out over our motion, our proposition, "it's time to end the war on terror." you have heard two of the opening statements, and now on to the third. %$* 13
i want to introduce juliette kayyem, who, as i said at the beginning of the debate, these people on the stage really have had their hands in the business that they're talking about. %$* 13
so her resume includes stints at the justice department, former assistant secretary to the department of homeland security, the national security and foreign policy columnist for the boston globe. %$* 13
you've also served as chief of homeland security in the state of massachusetts. %$* 13
you're a faculty member at harvard's kennedy school a government; a mother of three, we've heard earlier, and often described as the obama administration's highest ranking senior arab-american female official. %$* 13
wow. %$* 238
wow. %$* 238
so which of those-- %$* 13
tells you how many. %$* 238
which of those items is the most relevant? %$* 13
american. %$* 238
american. %$* 238
ladies and gentlemen, juliette kayyam. %$* 13
so i want to thank bob and dana, peter, mike and rich and the organizers of intelligence squared; and i also want to take a moment to acknowledge, obviously, tonight, 10 years later and the tragedy and burdens this city has suffered. %$* 238
we will debate with passion here but with the full acknowledgement that many of you suffered tremendously. %$* 238
the proposition i'm arguing for tonight is the war on terror is over. %$* 238
that can mean a lot of things, obviously. %$* 238
for me, it means one thing. %$* 238
a certain mind-set came to be known as the "war on terror," and that mind-set, thankfully, is over. %$* 238
to explain what i mean, i want to tell you a story. %$* 238
i did reenter government in 2006 when governor deval patrick became governor of massachusetts; and one of my duties was to oversee the massachusetts national guard. %$* 238
i inherited a program that had been established on september 12 which was to put national guard members on the roadways, leading up to our only nuclear facility, pilgrim facility, and it was understandable in those days, you wanted to show greater force protection. %$* 238
more than five years later, they were still there, the national guard members. %$* 238
despite the tremendous work being done to counter the terrorist threat and despite no evidence that terrorists would seek to enter by road a heavily fortified facility, nobody involved with intricacies of that security thought that they were still necessary, but no one really knew how to pivot. %$* 238
it's very hard to pivot. %$* 238
and the political military and public input had to be aligned. %$* 238
it took us awhile, but eventually we did move on, and i tell that story not as evidence that the terrorist threat is over, not at all. %$* 238
i tell it to say that there were other procedures that we then put in place, more aggressive surveillance, sharing better surveillance of the streets, better communications between the nuclear facility owners and the local first responders that we instituted instead of the 19 national guard members rotating 24/7. %$* 238
i tell this story to remind you that 10 years is a long time. %$* 238
it is a long time to fight any war but one particularly where the enemy has changed so dramatically. %$* 238
and over that time, there had been a whole range of shifts in every jurisdiction in the federal government that had been similar to the one i just described. %$* 238
so to just call the ongoing efforts to dismantle, kill and disrupt al-qaeda and its affiliates a continuity or continuation of the war on terror-- %$* 238
capital t, capital w, capital t-- %$* 238
is to treat the united states and the government apparatus established since 9/11 as frozen in time. %$* 238
it assumes that there has been no learning, no growth, no perspectives achieved, no recognition of mistakes made, no priority shifts, no advancements in our abilities and capabilities. %$* 238
it assumes that time had stood still for us. %$* 238
in many respects this debate actually is a few years too late. %$* 238
the war on terror, as it became known, was an entire government ideology, based on the notion that islamic terrorism represented a unified and operationally centralized threat to manning a predominantly military response with the president as commander in chief who could use any means necessary. %$* 238
nobody, especially people who have served in national security, denied that there is still a terrorist threat, and the u.s. government, under any administration, to pick up on general hayden's point, is going to have a variety of tools to use to combat that threat, including military force. %$* 238
nobody needs to make apologies for that, neither the left nor the right. %$* 238
the authorization for the use of military force passed immediately after 9/11, gave the president and the future ones the legal authorization to fight al-qaeda with force. %$* 238
it is still the law today, and it is still good law; but the fact that the government continues to use many of these same counterterrorism strategies, including killing bin laden, of course, does not mean that the war on terror and all that it entailed remain because we should go through the list-- %$* 238
the enhanced interrogation, the dark side, the with us or against us, the indiscriminate interviewing a particular arab and muslim communities, the registration of arab immigrants, military tribunals that adhere to standards unrecognized in military law, the color code alerts, the breathless press conferences, the rejection of the law of wars, the treating of the geneva conventions as quaint, secret wiretapping and violation of established law, the disdain for the judiciary-- %$* 238
those were also part of that war. %$* 238
and thankfully, they are over, and they began to be over during the bush administration and the continuation in this administration. %$* 238
it has not been more of the same, and that is good because we got better. %$* 238
over these 10 years during both bush and obama administrations, the u.s. security apparatus became more focused and sophisticated. %$* 238
it was because the threat had changed. %$* 238
it was more decentralized and disparate, and we have adapted to that, certainly, by using military tactics to kill al-qaeda affiliates worldwide, but we have also become more focused, measuring success by effectiveness over shear activity. %$* 238
and nowhere is this more true than in homeland security. %$* 238
unlike war, homeland security is very bottom up. %$* 238
it begins with locals who run police departments or emergency management divisions or public health facilities. %$* 238
it is overseen by mayors and governors, and if you want to talk about a change in america, there's only one governor who was governor on 9/11 still in the state house, and he's debating in california right now because he doesn't want to be governor anymore. %$* 238
that's rick perry. %$* 238
so, i mean, there's just been tremendous change over these 10 years; and so calling it a war on terror for them does not help them manage budget or defend certain programs or know actually how to prioritize. %$* 238
as rich falkenrath-- %$* 238
who helped institutionalize the phrase "dual-use" policies that help the cop on the street in fighting crime as well as in counterterrorism; that provide training for emergency managers for a tower falling as well as hurricane irene-- %$* 238
these are the most sustainable and effective. %$* 238
the color-code system seemed appropriate in an era that created a warlike climate but provided no clarity to the first responders on how to-- %$* 238
how to react, and the public rightfully rejected it. %$* 238
more localized efforts to engage immigrant communities or in nationally adopting to "see something, say something" campaign that came out of new york city are good and effective government action, and they are necessary as we have reason to be concerned with radicalization in our own nation. %$* 238
none of these require military engagement or mind-set although, of course, as i've said, there might be a need for military engagement, and it's authorized by law. %$* 238
these are smart strategies adopted by people across the ideological spectrum. %$* 238
i am here not because i have some invested intellectual interest in saying the war is over. %$* 238
military efforts will need to be utilized. %$* 238
that goes without saying. %$* 238
but do not forget what the war on terror was, and do not forget how much progress we have made in moving past it. %$* 238
what has replaced it is a different way of thinking about the threat and our response. %$* 238
surely, not everything is perfect, but criticism is accepted. %$* 238
there is nothing soft or weak or liberal about believing the war on terror is over. %$* 238
it is actually the way the world is; and ask yourself "are we less safe now from having moved on? %$* 238
thank you, juliette kayyam. %$* 13
our motion is "it's time to end the war on terror." and here to speak fourth and against the motion, richard falkenrath, who has served as deputy commissioner for counterterrorism of the new york city police department and as deputy, homeland security advisor to president bush during the bush administration, obviously. %$* 13
and richard, i don't know if you know this, but coincidentally, we lived on the same street in washington during that period, and all of the neighbors had a habit of watching your face as you would come home from work every day to try to figure out if we were in trouble or not. %$* 13
and i just wanted to congratulate you on your poker face. %$* 13
oh, thank you. %$* 119
and we never knew. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, richard falkenrath. %$* 13
that was a scary time, and happily it's over. %$* 119
now, forgive my voice. %$* 119
i've got a little bit of a cold. %$* 119
it's a great pleasure to be here. %$* 119
thank you to the organizers, the sponsors, to the other panelists, all of whom are long and close friends. %$* 119
we've known each other for a long time. %$* 119
debates like this often turn on trying to convince the audience, the voters, of a definition; and if you get them thinking about a proposition defined your way, it's clear which side should prevail, and if you get them thinking about a proposition defined the other way, it's clear which side should prevail. %$* 119
and this is no exception to that rule. %$* 119
the war on terror is a very open-ended concept, and it can be construed in many different ways. %$* 119
and peter and juliette are-- %$* 119
construe it in a way that really isn't that surprising, but they were very candid about it, frankly, which is they'd like it to be defined as a certain mind-set that we experienced some point in the past that we no longer should have today. %$* 119
and i find, if i were probably-- %$* 119
if i was on their side of the proposition, i'd argue it the same way because this is a tough one to argue if you argue it the way mike and i think it should be argued which, in fact, juliette agrees with, which is you need to make this an operational proposition. %$* 119
you need to define it in some very precise way so there's something really to weigh in on. %$* 119
it's not just some squishy mind-set and set of feelings. %$* 119
it's actually something practical. %$* 119
and here, in fact, it is something practical. %$* 119
war on terror-- %$* 119
war is a legal state, as mike said. %$* 119
it exists in law. %$* 119
it is decreed by congress and, in fact, they did decree it in this case with the authorization for the use of military force, passed by congress on sept. %$* 119
14, signed by president bush on sept. %$* 119
18, and still in force today. %$* 119
and the way i understand this proposition that we're voting on here, is essentially-- %$* 119
"should we repeal or modify this in some way or another? %$* 119
" and mike and i say, "no, we shouldn't. %$* 119
this should still stand." juliette also agrees with us. %$* 119
she thinks it should stand too. %$* 119
i'm not sure where peter is. %$* 119
but it's worth noting exactly what is says because this is what it means to be in a war on terror. %$* 119
it means to have this as your law of the land. %$* 119
it says that the president is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on september 11th or harbored such organizations or persons in order to prevent any further acts of international terrorism against the united states by such nations, organizations or persons. %$* 119
now, our position is quite simple: it's that this should stay the law of the land. %$* 119
this should be the law in the united states, because, if it's not, then something peter said is no longer the case: having the number two job in al-qaeda is no longer the most dangerous job in the world. %$* 119
it is today. %$* 119
and he's still there. %$* 119
the number two in al-qaeda-- %$* 119
it's much, much diminished, decimated probably isn't too strong a word for al-qaeda. %$* 119
but the number two officer in al- qaeda on 9/11, ayman al-zawahiri, a shadow of the man bin laden was, he's still alive. %$* 119
he's in pakistan. %$* 119
but for this provision of law, we can't use military force unilaterally against him. %$* 119
this is what makes such action lawful, and without this, the alternative is to go arrest him, mirandize him, bring him back to the court, which is an option, which frankly i don't believe should be taken off the table, either. %$* 119
probably not what we will end up pursuing in his case. %$* 119
but it simply makes no sense. %$* 119
it makes no sense to say you should repeal this. %$* 119
so that's my sort of first big point to you, is this is the law of the land. %$* 119
the war on terror is a legal state that gives us opportunities to do things under the code of law, not extra-legally, so, if that commando team does go in and kill someone, it's not murder. %$* 119
it is, in fact, an act of war. %$* 119
blessed by both branches of government-- %$* 119
the judiciary-- %$* 119
the executive and the legislative-- %$* 119
and without this, illegal. %$* 119
so, we don't want that. %$* 119
and this strikes me as, clearly, sensible to continue. %$* 119
now, should it continue indefinitely? %$* 119
who knows? %$* 119
i'm not prepared to say exactly when it should stop. %$* 119
but right now, today, when we know, some of the perpetrators of 9/11 are still at liberty, presumably in pakistan. %$* 119
it really makes no sense whatsoever to repeal this. %$* 119
now, juliette and peter would have us think instead about the proposition in a different way, and say, “it's about a mindset.” it's about that terrible state when john referred to when neighbors would look at a senior white house official's face to see how it was when he came home from work. %$* 119
those days are happily over, and hopefully they'll never come back. %$* 119
that's really not the proposition here. %$* 119
yes, there were lots of that we're-- %$* 119
if we want to have another proposition which was, did president bush overdo it in the first four years after 9/11, that's a whole different debate. %$* 119
and maybe, they will prevail on that one. %$* 119
we're debating a different proposition here. %$* 119
this is not about whether we think president bush got it just right in the first couple of years after 9/11 or not. %$* 119
this is also not really a partisan issue. %$* 119
and yeah, i worked for bush. %$* 119
but i also worked for mike bloomberg. %$* 119
he-- %$* 119
who knows what he is. %$* 119
i mean, he was a-- %$* 119
now he's independent. %$* 119
then he was a republican. %$* 119
at one point, he was a democrat. %$* 119
this is not really a partisan thing. %$* 119
but peter made an interesting point. %$* 119
he said president obama has more correctly and more precisely characterized the continued offensive action against al- qaeda and its affiliates. %$* 119
and he's absolutely right, that the president-- %$* 119
president obama's rhetoric is very different from president bush's. %$* 119
they talked about it very differently. %$* 119
but the practice-- %$* 119
the nitty-gritty of what happens in counter-terrorism internationally, operationally, from the last four years of the bush administration to today, in 9/11-- %$* 119
not only is it fundamentally unchanged. %$* 119
obama is tougher. %$* 119
he is harsher. %$* 119
he is sharper. %$* 119
i'll give you just one example. %$* 119
i understand-- %$* 119
mike probably knows this-- %$* 119
i just hear it from the news. %$* 119
there is a list of individuals who may be targeted, by name, individually, for lethal air strikes. %$* 119
under-- %$* 119
that list started under bush. %$* 119
i think it notified to congress. %$* 119
under bush, that list consisted of only non-u.s.persons. %$* 119
so, foreigners. %$* 119
if we are to believe what we read in the paper, president obama has added a u.s.citizen to that list, who may be targeted by name. %$* 119
this is an extremely liberal, former constitutional law professor who has added a u.s.citizen to a list of people who may be targeted by name. %$* 119
now, he does it because of this aspect of law, which consists today. %$* 119
that individual, anwar al-awlaki, is in yemen. %$* 119
he's a u.s.citizen. %$* 119
he is vulnerable to lethal strike today that are lawful under u.s.law. %$* 119
i submit today it makes no sense to repeal that law at this time, and thus, under the terms of this debate and the war on terror. %$* 119
thank you. %$* 119
thank you, mr. %$* 13
falkenrath. %$* 13
and that concludes round 1 of this intelligence squared u.s.debate, where the motion being argued is, it is time to end the war on terror. %$* 13
keep in mind how you voted at the top of the evening. %$* 13
we're going to ask you to vote again at the end of the debate, and reminding you that the team that has changed the most minds will be declared our winner. %$* 13
now, before we go on to round 2, i want to correct a mistake i made in the pronunciation of juliette’s surname. %$* 13
and i just want to-- %$* 13
not just to be nice-- %$* 13
i want to actually say it again as i said it at the beginning of the program, so that it can be edited correctly into the radio broadcast. %$* 13
and so, i'm going to say and then i'd love it if you clapped with as much-- %$* 13
fervor as you did the first time. %$* 13
and peter's partner, juliette kayyem, who-- %$* 13
in the obama administration-- %$* 13
was an assistant security for homeland security. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13
i apologize. %$* 13
i really think name pronunciation is entirely unforgivable, so you don't even have to forgive me, okay? %$* 13
so, now onto round 2, where the debaters address each other directly and answer questions from the audience and from me. %$* 13
we're here at the skirball center for the performing arts at new york university. %$* 13
we have two teams of two arguing this motion-- %$* 13
“it is time to end the war on terror.” the side arguing for that proposition-- %$* 13
juliette kayyem and peter bergen-- %$* 13
are arguing that it never made sense to call our response to september 11th “the war,” and that in any case, the enemy that provoked that war-- %$* 13
al-qaeda-- %$* 13
is now on its last legs. %$* 13
arguing against the motion-- %$* 13
that it's too soon end the war on terror-- %$* 13
michael hayden and richard falkenrath. %$* 13
their view, that there are still enemies out there, dedicated to hurting us. %$* 13
and as-- %$* 13
that as long they are there, calling it a war gives the government the tools and the powers that it needs to protect the people. %$* 13
so, i want to ask a question to the side that's arguing that it's time to end the war on terror. %$* 13
and it's this: do our enemies have any say in telling us whether this is a war or not? %$* 13
if they are there, and they want to hurt us, and even if al-qaeda had been-- %$* 13
had been put on the run, it was clear in the documents that were recovered from osama bin laden's hideout, that they were still trying. %$* 13
and as long as they're still trying-- %$* 13
as long as it's a war to them, can we say that it's not a war to us? %$* 13
well, there's a very substantial difference between it-- %$* 91
peter bergen. %$* 13
i mean, sure, there was often-- %$* 91
when, in bin laden's house, in abbottabad, or after all these blue sky plans to attack us on the 10th anniversary of 9/11.i think i can tell you right now, that's not going to happen. %$* 91
these were blue sky plans. %$* 91
these were kind of doodlings of a guy was basically spending five years with his three wives, with not much to do-- %$* 91
and thinking about, you know, like, some sort of grotesque parody of a dr. %$* 91
no james bond, sort of sitting there, coming up with-- %$* 91
plotting mayhem. %$* 91
but these were not, you know, the government itself-- %$* 91
dhs-- %$* 91
has said you know, that you know, these were-- %$* 91
there was nothing there then. %$* 91
there was no operation. %$* 91
he was essentially somebody who history had sidelined. %$* 91
you know, president obama has said something i think is quite accurate. %$* 91
“he's a small man on the wrong side of history.” and history just sped up for them, with the arab spring and the death of bin laden. %$* 91
and for us to sort of live in a state of constant fear that they're going to do something to us is to basically hand them a victory that they didn't even have-- %$* 91
let's hear from richard falkenrath. %$* 13
when he was alive. %$* 91
the direct answer to your question, john, is no, they don't. %$* 119
whether we are at war or not is up to the united states and its constitutional authority to decide. %$* 119
but peter did something once again that he did in his opening remarks, which is try to get you to think that we somehow stand for the proposition that you should live in constant fear forever, and it should never go away. %$* 119
that's absolutely not what we're saying. %$* 119
nothing could be further from the truth. %$* 119
i worked for the nypd.our job is not to make the people feel unsafe in their communities. %$* 119
we want people to feel safe. %$* 119
that's why you show up to work in the morning and do your job. %$* 119
so, just, let's be clear. %$* 119
we're at war on terror. %$* 119
we have this continued legal status of a war on terror so that everyone doesn't live in constant fear. %$* 119
okay, okay-- %$* 238
juliette kayyem. %$* 13
i'm a lawyer, and let me tell you what the aumf says. %$* 238
because i agree with it. %$* 238
and i agree with them. %$* 238
i thought the question was, should the war on terror continue? %$* 238
so, i didn't bring my legal books. %$* 238
but if you want to view the war on terror as solely a legal issue-- %$* 238
the authorization for the use of military force is because of a debate between-- %$* 238
hard to imagine that they actually debated this after september 11th-- %$* 238
is limited to al-qaeda and its affiliates. %$* 238
and it gives the president authorization to use a whole bunch of tools-- %$* 238
including military action-- %$* 238
but a whole bunch of them, to fight al-qaeda-- %$* 238
those responsible for 9/11-- %$* 238
and its affiliates. %$* 238
that's what it does. %$* 238
and that is great. %$* 238
and we should continue to support it. %$* 238
but why is that %$* 119
but under that not everything was done under the aumf. first of all, this notion of a war on terror justified-- %$* 238
and we can get into a legal argument. %$* 238
and i did this for a while, so i'm happy to get into a legal argument. %$* 238
the authorization for the use of military force was limited both in terms of its target, and did not initiate a war on terror. %$* 238
but let's also not forget their legal analysis. %$* 238
their legal analysis-- %$* 238
if you want to talk law-- %$* 238
was actually that because it was a war on terror, congress in many ways could not limit the president's authority in a number of items that we can remember-- %$* 238
that we can all go through. %$* 238

but at the upper level, at the most visible levels, and if money talks, when is that power going to lie with women? %$* 522
yeah, take it, dan abrams, first. %$* 13
i think that eventually the results are going to speak for themselves. %$* 520
when people start thinking about and hearing about and learning about how much more effective female political leaders are, for example, i think that there will be a change. %$* 520
people will vote differently. %$* 520
remember, when people say to me, well, why are there so many-- %$* 520
look, women should be blaming themselves with regard to voting because women are the majority of the voters out there. %$* 520
but what's interesting is, when you get more female candidates, you don't necessarily get a change with regard to the voting habits of women. %$* 520
so the answer to your question, is i think when it comes to newscasters, when it comes to political leaders, and i think in a lot of these other areas, in finance, i think that ultimately the results will speak for themselves. %$* 520
and that's part of the reason why i think this proposition of men are finished-- %$* 520
you know, while certainly hyperbole, if you look at the results, it's a dangerous world upcoming, not today, a dangerous world coming for men. %$* 520
other side? %$* 13
david? %$* 13
i mean, i think buildings are always going to fall down. %$* 521
things are going to burn. %$* 521
you're always going to need men to get in there and do the dirty jobs, do the dangerous jobs. %$* 521
the world is becoming more dangerous than ever. %$* 521
i think that a lot of the leaders of the world as we discussed are men. %$* 521
and i think the-- %$* 521
you have to get the country running right here first. %$* 521
you have to focus on health and wellness. %$* 521
i think that universal healthcare is a step in the right direction. %$* 521
men and women are partners. %$* 521
and once that happens, but it's a long ways away right now, you're right, it's 16 percent of women are in congress. %$* 521
16 percent of women are serving on the board of corporations. %$* 521
so there's a lot of work that needs to be done. %$* 521
but we have to do it together. %$* 521
and that's-- %$* 521
and we have to do it here first. %$* 521
okay. %$* 13
sir? %$* 13
you're holding two fingers up. %$* 13
yep. %$* 13
to dan and hanna, even as women take over, if you will-- %$* 18
and i agree the trends are there. %$* 18
there's no question about it-- %$* 18
wouldn't there be inevitably a sort of market adjustment whereby men will learn from women how to be better ceos, how to be better political leaders, better administrators, better members of society and that ultimately, it won't mean that anybody's finished, but that there will be a balancing and an improvement. %$* 18
christina, why don't you take that first, and then we'll come to the other side. %$* 13
christina hoff sommers. %$* 13
yes, i don't disagree that there is going to be transformation. %$* 519
this debate is not about whether or not we're in a period of transformation and men's and women's roles are changing. %$* 519
of course they are. %$* 519
so i'm not contesting that. %$* 519
what i'm contesting is this very aggressive, dramatic resolution, defended by my colleagues that men are finished. %$* 519
so i pose that. %$* 519
but as far as men improving, i think they will. %$* 519
i think-- %$* 519
hanna rosin. %$* 13
they always have had-- %$* 519
face challenges and-- %$* 519
and hard times and overcome them, and they will do the same now. %$* 519
hanna rosin. %$* 13
that's the best-case scenario, and that's what i wish would happen. %$* 518
however, like i said, there's just all this evidence that men don't respond that well and are not that flexible. %$* 518
people, like she says, people have measured things for many, many years about male preference. %$* 518
people have measured male feelings about male identity. %$* 518
now, female feelings about what's okay as a woman, and people have measured this for college students and adults have changed radically. %$* 518
women now think it's much more okay to be aggressive in the workplace. %$* 518
it's much more okay to win. %$* 518
they ask a series of questions. %$* 518
the male identification hasn't-- %$* 518
self-identification hasn't changed basically in 60 years. %$* 518
men always think it's only acceptable to be a guy in this tiny, narrow range. %$* 518
and they're always defining themselves against women, not towards women, where women are always doing the opposite, which is they're defining themselves as more aggressive, competitive, et cetera. %$* 518
why? %$* 518
i don't know why. %$* 518
i don't know if that's biology or what. %$* 518
but that's just how it is. %$* 518
so we would hope so, but we don't know. %$* 518
sir, right in the aisle there. %$* 13
and i just want to mention that if you're in an area where you can't see the numbers on your wristwatch, i can't see you because you're-- %$* 13
the lights aren't bright enough. %$* 13
so that if you are in that area where it's darker, and you want to ask a question, if you could move down, i might have a chance to find you. %$* 13
sir, go ahead. %$* 13
can you identify yourself? %$* 13
my name is aaron, and the group that i am a part of is men with a bachelor's degree. %$* 18
that's the relevant group that i'm a part of. %$* 18
bachelor's degree, by the way, may be overdue for a name change. %$* 18
but-- %$* 18
i can't believe we never thought of that before. %$* 19
i think you deserve a round of applause for that. %$* 13
wow. %$* 18
i wasn't planning to start the standup comedy till next week. %$* 18
i look at this, i see a man and a woman-- %$* 18
a man and a woman, but one style of debate here, one style of debate here. %$* 18
and i'm-- %$* 18
and it just seems that men are finished is just an unfortunate title since both groups seem to be saying it's more about traits. %$* 18
and so my question is, is it-- %$* 18
could it be more men who have more feminine traits, who-- %$* 18
or traditionally feminine traits, who are succeeding. %$* 18
and i'm thinking of people like bill gates or mark zuckerberg, and are succeeding for that reason. %$* 18
could they then potentially reverse the trend and be more successful than women because there are the-- %$* 18
what are the feminine traits, though, that you would have in mind? %$* 13
well, i'm just-- %$* 18
what they've been saying, that women pay attention more, they're more patient, they're better at certain things. %$* 18
okay. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
i hear your question then. %$* 13
why don't we take it first to dan abrams. %$* 13
just so i understand, what-- %$* 520
do i-- %$* 520
i think your question is, if more men could be more like women-- %$* 13
yeah, look. %$* 520
there's-- %$* 520
no, no, no, no. %$* 520
that's actually a fair point. %$* 520
look, i'll take that serious. %$* 520
i don't mean you want to ask anything else? %$* 520
well, i-- %$* 18
no, no, go ahead, just take it then because-- %$* 13
it's not men acting more like women just because they want to act like women or learning to act like women, it's men who do by nature-- %$* 18
like i feel like people told me that i have traits that are more like a woman personality-wise, not physically and my voice-- %$* 18
not your hair, it's not your hair they're talking about. %$* 518
but just a matter of-- %$* 18
and men are already in the positions of power and then men in positions of power who want to keep men in power change the rules of the game or in some way-- %$* 18
but ultimately yes, men with more feminine traits succeeding because people are embracing more feminine traits, okay. %$* 18
i'll say this, that in the world of finance there is a clear recognition that the traders need to behave more classically female, meaning that they are now being trained at many classically male financial firms to engage in behavior, consensus building, less of the sort of typically male buying and trading like crazy, taking risks, and becoming a bit more risk averse, et cetera, to improve long term performance. %$* 520
again, getting back to some of the statistics that i laid out, that's as a result of risk aversion, now, that doesn't-- %$* 520
that means if you're going to swing for the homerun every time, you're going to hit that homerun more often and you're also going to strike out more often. %$* 520
and yet if you behave more in what is viewed as classically female, more risk averse, you're going to end up with more-- %$* 520
and to use the sports analogy-- %$* 520
singles, doubles, and triples, and as a result have better returns, so just-- %$* 520
david, do you want to respond to that? %$* 13
i think you're a superior human being who is adapting, that's exactly what's going on. %$* 521
you are adopting certain traits that will help you survive and excel. %$* 521
there is nothing wrong with that. %$* 521
what is unfortunate is the argument cannot-- %$* 521
of women gaining traction, which they're trying to make this about, is not what in fact the debate is about, which is men aren't finished. %$* 521
and-- %$* 521
right, i was talking about surpassing them, not equaling them, surpassing them. %$* 520
yes, and maybe-- %$* 521
look, i can sit here and talk about the ratio of college-educated men to women in birmingham being 13 to 17 and in oakland 11 to eight, we can talk about stats all day long. %$* 521
but if you come back to the facts, the main facts when it comes to how wealth is distributed, the fact that men are still earning more than women, that they're still running boards, running countries, inventing new technologies, you are in a situation where men aren't finished, and that's why you have to vote against this motion. %$* 521
yeah, right there with this-- %$* 13
yeah, i'm looking right at you. %$* 13
and just wait for the mic. %$* 13
something for dave and then one question for the panel, but you mentioned that men still hold the majority of resources, 99 percent and they run 92 percent of the countries, do you honestly think that's because they're more competent? %$* 19
i mean, why do you think that is? %$* 19
do you think it has something to do with deeply rooted structural patriarchy that's been enforced through violence over the past 40,000 years, like-- %$* 19
and then one more question for the whole panel-- %$* 19
wait on that one because-- %$* 13
i'm sorry %$* 19
because nobody will remember the two, and that was a pretty good one. %$* 13
it's a quick one, it's just-- %$* 19
no, hold off, i'll come back to you for the second one and-- %$* 13
but let this one go and then-- %$* 13
but i'll come back. %$* 13
go ahead, david. %$* 13
yeah, look, i think that men have had an enormous head start. %$* 521
that's what i'm arguing. %$* 521
i am for gender equality. %$* 521
i am just saying men aren't finished. %$* 521
you know, and i-- %$* 521
and that's why you have to vote against the motion. %$* 13
and that's why you have to vote against the motion. %$* 521
we have to stay very focused here. %$* 521
and look, i think one of the things-- %$* 521
so men have had a tremendous head start, that's worldwide, the gains they've made, certainly women have made enormous gains and will continue to make them, and we should support all of them, but it's not what we're debating here tonight. %$* 521
and it's funny the point that hanna made about men's health as a lose your gut type magazine. %$* 521
well, let's get back to that for one second, okay? %$* 521
this right here is the world's leading women's magazine, okay, right here. %$* 521
for the radio audience, tell us what you're holding up right now. %$* 13
this is “cosmopolitan,” okay, which just happens to be the world’s leading women’s magazine. %$* 521
i think they’re in like 97 countries or something. %$* 521
left side, naughty-- %$* 521
21 naughty sex tips, bold breathless moves. %$* 521
wait, so why do you want to be like that? %$* 518
shrink your inner thighs in six minutes a day. %$* 521
times he wants you to be jealous. %$* 521
four words that seduce any man any time. %$* 521
this magazine is concerned-- %$* 521
it seems like women are concerned a lot with men, okay. %$* 521
then we go over to a magazine like “men’s health,”-- %$* 521
also happens to be the world’s largest men’s magazine. %$* 521
and now, here you have gym-free abs-- %$* 521
you know this is a non-profit organization. %$* 13
get ripped workout, you know, torn to shreds: the untold story of the afghanistan war. %$* 521
so why don’t we-- %$* 518
we’ve just proved that men are obsessed with themselves, and women are obsessed with men. %$* 518
i’m sorry, women-- %$* 18
let me come back to your second question and make it very short because i’d like to move on to-- %$* 13
go back, this whole conversation also has been very binary between men and women. %$* 19
and i was curious, for everyone and maybe for hanna who’s done so much on-the-ground reporting, also, where like gender non-conforming people and trans people fit into this conversation? %$* 19
well, they-- %$* 518
you know, i mean, one thing that we all wish for is for men to accept a broader range of self identities. %$* 518
so in the sense that, you know, it’s much more acceptable to be gay now, no, there’s no problem with being gay. %$* 518
you know, gay people can get married, they cannot get married, that maybe holds up a world in which it’s okay for a wide range, like it’s okay for a guy to be a stay-at-home dad. %$* 518
there’s a new sitcom about a guy who’s a stay-at-home dad and maybe you should watch it, you know. %$* 518
maybe more guys will become stay-at-home dads. %$* 518
so you don’t have to feel like super self-conscious if you’re a guy whose wife, for example, makes more money than you do, which is a-- %$* 518
which is now almost 30 percent of the population, which, again, was unheard of only, you know, 20 years ago is now fairly common. %$* 518
and you don’t have to like slink away in shame if that is you. %$* 518
okay, i need to do another radio break, so i’d just like to ask you to applaud again, and i’ll come back and-- %$* 13
so we are in the middle of a question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i’m john donvan, your moderator. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two. %$* 13
and they are debating this motion, "men are finished." and i want to do one more time without the applause to give them that option. %$* 13
so we’re in the middle of the q and a section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i’m john donvan of abc news, your moderator. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, debating this motion, "men are finished." so let’s go to another question. %$* 13
sir, you’ve got a white card in your hand. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 523
but one thing i want to say. %$* 13
the two-part questions are driving me nuts and long, long premises are driving me nuts, so just write out the question. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
it’s very brief. %$* 523
okay. %$* 13
my name is jay searson i’m one of the few men in that own- your-own-company, entrepreneurial category, so i’m not finished, i think. %$* 523
so i’d like to point out, ms. %$* 523
rosin, your whole point seems to be, you know, you’re arguing that what we have now is the beginning of a trend. %$* 523
so, suppose that just before tom edison invents the light bulb, all the candlestick makers are irishmen. %$* 523
after edison invents the light bulb, all those candlestick-making jobs go away, and things look pretty bad for the irish. %$* 523
but nobody would say that it’s the end of irishmen. %$* 523
it’s the end of candlestick makers. %$* 523
and we’ve just had a housing bubble that eliminated a ton of construction jobs. %$* 523
and those construction jobs were overwhelmingly male because men actually had a genetic advantage doing construction. %$* 523
it requires heavy lifting. %$* 523
okay, okay, okay. %$* 13
so why is it a trend-- %$* 523
one more sentence from your mouth and have a question mark at the end. %$* 13
because you’ve got a good point, but focus it. %$* 13
that’s the question. %$* 523
why is it a trend? %$* 523
i think i got it. %$* 518
i got it, i got it. %$* 518
okay. %$* 13
okay, so in the first recession, that’s what we thought. %$* 518
we thought, “oh, it’s just the end of construction jobs.” and then in the second recession, we thought, “oh, it’s just the end of, you know, pipeline fitter jobs,” and then we thought it’s just the end of this and the end of that. %$* 518
and then suddenly we realized, no, it’s actually the end of the manufacturing era. %$* 518
so you realize that this was a trend that was not going to go away or reverse itself and that all these jobs that men happened to do were sort of shrinking and shrinking and shrinking. %$* 518
and they were never going to come back. %$* 518
so, you know, i don’t know-- %$* 518
you want me to say it’s like the end of manufacturing-- %$* 518
let’s hear from your opponents. %$* 13
christina? %$* 13
first of all, i just don’t accept the idea that men, the jobs that men will hold in the future are going to be-- %$* 519
they’re going to have to be dance therapists or executive producers. %$* 519
if you look at the projections from the labor department, we're going to need vast-- %$* 519
millions and millions of engineers and people that are experts in information technology. %$* 519
and there are still going to have to be people constructing and manufacturing. %$* 519
so it's naive to suggest that we're moving away entirely from jobs that were conventionally done by men. %$* 519
and i just want to go back to one question that was raised before about where do transgendered people and gay people fit in. %$* 519
it was actually-- %$* 519
a lot of my positions about men and women came from sympathy that i had for transgendered and gay people, people that didn't fit into their gender role, because one of the things they tell us is that your gender role is very powerful. %$* 519
and it's not socially constructed. %$* 519
it's something you are born with. %$* 519
and what i urge in my writing is to be respectful, yes, of people who defy the stereotypes of their gender, but also to be respectful of those of us who embody the stereotypes. %$* 519
there are many people who are-- %$* 519
conventionally fem-- %$* 519
yep. %$* 13
he wants-- %$* 519
did you want to-- %$* 13
i would just say i completely agree with the point about trends. %$* 521
they're called trends for a reason. %$* 521
they don't last forever. %$* 521
that's why we're not all walking around-- %$* 521
no, they're called trends because they're true. %$* 518
but it misses the point, which is that the more important point, directly responding to your question about the candlesticks, is that what we're seeing in society today, and hanna has studied a lot more than have i, is the idea that the people who are making candles and engaging in jobs that are becoming outdated or whatever the case may be, women have figured out a way to navigate the tough economy better than men. %$* 520
and they are simply adapting better than are men. %$* 520
and that's the really important point here. %$* 520
it's not just that the male jobs are being eliminated. %$* 520
yes. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
yes, hi. %$* 524
hello. %$* 524
diane salvatore, editor of prevention magazine. %$* 524
is it true that-- %$* 524
that men with power and money tend to self-destruct more than women do? %$* 524
and i think here of oprah versus charlie sheen. %$* 524
or how about anybody versus charlie sheen? %$* 518
that's why i said before that dan is probably finished, but not others. %$* 521
i'm just thankful to you for mentioning charlie sheen because i feel like you just say "charlie sheen" enough times, and everybody will vote for us. %$* 518
sir, i'm looking right at you. %$* 13
if you stand up-- %$* 13
yep. %$* 13
michael, come in, please. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
that was a question. %$* 13
that was a focused question. %$* 13
that's the model. %$* 13
by a woman. %$* 518
all right. %$* 18
i'm going to try and redeem the men's side with this question. %$* 18
you spoke earlier about bloggers versus loggers. %$* 18
i guess everybody would agree that technology is the new frontier. %$* 18
and if you look at silicon valley, it's dominated by young men. %$* 18
what do you say to that? %$* 18
well, whenever i look at these-- %$* 518
hanna rosin. %$* 13
questions, because we always think, oh, men are better at technology. %$* 518
they're better engineers. %$* 518
i do, in my head what i call the cross-border biology check. %$* 518
now, what is a cross-border biology check? %$* 518
i try and think, okay, is this just something we think is true because we look at it, and we assume it ever has to be true, while in india, half of engineering students are women. %$* 518
now, why is that? %$* 518
because it's encouraged in india, and because that's something everybody has to do. %$* 518
it's not something that men are necessarily better than women at. %$* 518
so i just feel like eventually that will be true here too. %$* 518
we put an emphasis on it, and women will do it. %$* 518
correction about india? %$* 519
in countries like-- %$* 519
people often say, look at india, look at malaysia. %$* 519
women are the engineers, and far more women are becoming physicists. %$* 519
in those countries, women don't have as much choice of what they do. %$* 519
because of economic pressures, they are forced to do careers in a society where there's more prosperity, women have more choice, and they go into other fields. %$* 519
and that's why if you look at what american women are majoring in it's art history and education, all sorts of things. %$* 519
they're not forced to do something they don't want to do. %$* 519
men do. %$* 519
that is their number one choice in college majors, or it's-- %$* 519
of all the majors, that's the one men choose, i guess, after business. %$* 519
whereas women, it's teaching. %$* 519
so there are-- %$* 519
there are differences in that, again, i am insisting that we need both in the new economy. %$* 519
right here, second row. %$* 13
a mic's going to come for you. %$* 13
second-- %$* 13
third stand. %$* 13
i'm sorry. %$* 13
i meant-- %$* 13
sorry. %$* 13
all right. %$* 18
i just wanted to clarify some things. %$* 18
the debate's title is called "men are finished." and it seems that all four of you agree and disagree on different points on how to interpret that. %$* 18
so can you-- %$* 18
can each panelist give some examples on the representative man and the representative woman that they think is defining these new trends? %$* 18
it's a good question. %$* 13
it will take a half an hour. %$* 13
i'm going to respectfully pass, but not to disrespect the question. %$* 13
i just think it would chew up too much time and maybe not get us to a new place. %$* 13
so if you could pass to your-- %$* 13
see, by being persistent-- %$* 13
yes. %$* 18
hello. %$* 18
my name is david, and i am a student here at nyu.and i'm male. %$* 18
but i just wanted to ask, because i've seen that a lot of the debate has been going on about what is considered traditionally male or traditionally female. %$* 18
and i was wondering if it was really possible to determine whether or not men are, quote, unquote, "finished," based on these traditional sort of stereotypical characteristics, because if you look at it, what is considered traditionally female is not what they're right now. %$* 18
like the female workers in business or economics or whatever tend to have more what we consider traditionally male traits. %$* 18
so a man going into nursing you feel would be going into a female profession? %$* 13
well, i would say that it's what’s considered traditionally female. %$* 18
but i think what we consider traditionally male or female-- %$* 18
so-- %$* 13
so iss not really whole. %$* 18
so if you focus your question down to one sentence, what, what is it? %$* 13
all right. %$* 18
is it-- %$* 18
is it really possible to say that men are finished based on what we consider to be traditionally male and female-- %$* 18
considering the fact that in modern times the definitions of said genders-- %$* 18
that the world is changing. %$* 13
i think i see what he's saying. %$* 13
can the lady from prevention magazine reformulate that? %$* 519
hanna rosin, do you want to take it? %$* 13
formulate that? %$* 518
who would like to take that? %$* 13
well, there is some evidence-- %$* 518
hanna rosin. %$* 13
that as women become more dominant, they take on more traits that we think of as traditionally masculine. %$* 518
so i think that a lot of these things are much more fluid than we think they are. %$* 518
that's why i'm always reluctant to enter into this gender biology question: women are like this, and men are like this. %$* 518
women have gotten vastly more aggressive. %$* 518
they are-- %$* 518
they're much, much more likely to get arrested, especially juvenile females than they were 20 years ago. %$* 518
you know, so this is a sort of scale that moves along a continuum. %$* 518
okay. %$* 13
though, as i said-- %$* 518
i'm guessing you will agree with that. %$* 13
so, sir-- %$* 13
well-- %$* 519
no? %$* 13
one thing she's left out. %$* 519
okay. %$* 519
go on. %$* 519
okay, no, no, no. %$* 13
christina, if you're serious, go ahead. %$* 13
well, it's one thing that does not change in human nature is that men tend to succeed and fail more spectacularly than females. %$* 519
so you find more males who are, in any economy, any situation, there are going to be males that are going to find their way to the top. %$* 519
and there will be males that will find their way to the bottom. %$* 519
right. %$* 13
men have that-- %$* 519
that capacity. %$* 519
that was dan abrams homerun-- %$* 13
swinging for the fence point. %$* 13
sir, you're standing in the aisle? %$* 13
yes. %$* 13
you just pointed to yourself. %$* 13
yeah, that's-- %$* 13
no, that's not-- %$* 13
that's me being confused, not him, all right? %$* 13
thank you. %$* 18
this is a point first made by slate magazine's emily bazelon who i think it was-- %$* 18
or what i heard is i think it's appropriate to do it here where you're a cosponsor. %$* 18
but the company wal-mart recently faced a lawsuit about systematically discriminating against women and whatever you think about the outcome of that. %$* 18
the point was, clearly wal-mart wasn't utilizing their-- %$* 18
or empowering their female work force. %$* 18
and all the economic evidence which wal-mart would have definitely had at its disposal would suggest that that would be the profit maximizing thing to do. %$* 18
and we all know wal-mart loves profit. %$* 18
so i guess my question for the panel is, why is that, and what does that mean for our motion? %$* 18
you know, i think it's a little-- %$* 13
i think it's a little bit off point on getting us to the question of whether we think men are finished or not, so respectfully, i'm going to pass on that. %$* 13
but i could just reformulate it. %$* 519
but i-- %$* 13
i-- %$* 13
i would just like to ask, why don't all of our leading companies, if they were really smart, fire all their males who are useless and hire females? %$* 519
well, they don't-- %$* 519
well, they're not saying that they're useless. %$* 13
they haven't gone that far. %$* 13
they're not useless, but they're on their way out. %$* 519
okay. %$* 13
so you want to answer that? %$* 13
yeah. %$* 518
i mean, they don't have to fire all of their males, but they certainly have to-- %$* 518
fire most of them. %$* 518
thank you. %$* 13
no, that's not where i was going with that. %$* 518
right there in the aisle, to your right, right, yes. %$* 13
could you please rise. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
the moderator started out by saying that increasing-- %$* 525
leslie bennetts, newsweek daily beast. %$* 525
the moderator started out by saying that increasingly men are not assuming the responsibilities of parenthood. %$* 525
both the men on the panel who are middle aged, single and childless would be examples of this. %$* 525
and i'd like to know why they think that this is so often the case these days, men are marrying less and less. %$* 525
men are not supporting their families. %$* 525
the statistics on the nonpayment of things like child support are astronomical. %$* 525
and that's always been one of the hallmarks of adulthood. %$* 525
i'd like to know what the panel has to say about that. %$* 525
since i'm being lumped in with dead beat dads, i think i'll probably pass on this one. %$* 520
i'm not touching that. %$* 518
i have three children. %$* 518
i just like to brag about that. %$* 518
i'm not going near that one. %$* 518
dave and dan, you can take that one. %$* 518
david zinczenko. %$* 13
well, i mean, i-- %$* 521
you know, obviously you're well-read and you've probably read the times today and the piece about how single men or unmarried men are sometimes the biggest contributors to their family and in their community, so-- %$* 521
statistically there's a lot of evidence-- %$* 525
if you're going to come back, it's okay to do so, but could you stand up again? %$* 13
yeah. %$* 525
sure. %$* 13
statistically there's a lot of evidence and i'm really curious about why you guys think that men are turning away from-- %$* 525
you know, i mean, a generation or two ago by the time men were in their late 20s they often had three or four kids. %$* 525
that's not the model today. %$* 525
i'm interested in what the men have to say about %$* 525
but women are also having-- %$* 520
but women are also having children later, i mean, it's not a male-female %$* 520
yeah, but a lot of women are having children alone because men don't want to participate. %$* 525
yeah, no, if we look at-- %$* 518
okay. %$* 520
or because-- %$* 520
if we look at this from the children's perspective and the children in this sort of 59 percent that i was talking about, we would definitely win and you would definitely have to vote for men are finished. %$* 518

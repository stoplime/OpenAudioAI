what's the source of that-- %$* 533
here's-- %$* 534
let me finish. %$* 534
what's the source for 2 million? %$* 533
because the bls doesn't collect that data. %$* 533
oh, absolutely. %$* 534
no, no, no. %$* 534
this is-- %$* 534
this is from the current population survey. %$* 534
okay. %$* 533
look-- %$* 534
don't you wish you hadn't asked or-- %$* 13
russ roberts-- %$* 534
they don't collect the hours data in %$* 533
russ is a friend of mine. %$* 534
i like russ. %$* 534
but-- %$* 534
so we've got the whole ad hominem thing worked out right away. %$* 13
you know there was a "but" there. %$* 534
no, i like russ a lot. %$* 534
but i am a-- %$* 534
i am aghast to hear russ say, “how many people would this hurt? %$* 534
who would this hurt? %$* 534
how would it hurt them? %$* 534
i don't know.” that's what he just said, "i don't know." you cannot, in my mind, in good faith, in this economy, in any economy, talk about abolishing the minimum wage and not know what its impact is going to be. %$* 534
that's way, way too reckless. %$* 534
now, the idea that workers are hurt by this the way russ and jim have argued is belied by research that looks very carefully at changes in minimum wages across different economies and different groups. %$* 534
now, i don't want to get-- %$* 534
i don't know if we want to go there now, but we need some time to explain, i think, to the audience, what the research actually shows. %$* 534
you can't just say, "black unemployment is high, and we have minimum wages, therefore high minimum wages cause high black unemployment," because we've had periods when we've raised the minimum wage in the 1990s, we've raised the minimum wage in 1996, black unemployment came way down. %$* 534
so i'm not saying that it came way down because we had a higher minimum wage. %$* 534
i'm saying there are a lot of moving parts. %$* 534
and the best research compares the impact of the minimum wage controlling for those moving parts. %$* 534
and that's what we've been citing. %$* 534
james dorn. %$* 13
may i respond to my friend? %$* 533
let me have-- %$* 13
let me bring in james dorn, and then you guys can be friends later. %$* 13
yeah, two points. %$* 532
if there's an excess supply of labor, low-skilled labor, and they can't get jobs, yeah, the minimum wage will come down. %$* 532
but the competition will be among the workers. %$* 532
the workers that have lower valued alternatives, they can't get a job at the minimum wage, they will not have an opportunity to get a job. %$* 532
i think that's a very important point. %$* 532
their wages will not stay low forever. %$* 532
most of these workers are young. %$* 532
they will be in, they will get good work habits, they will learn things. %$* 532
the employers will eventually pay them more as their productivity goes up. %$* 532
you don't want to put the cart before the horse. %$* 532
when you go to get a job, okay, the government can increase the minimum wage, give you a raise. %$* 532
but if your skills haven't changed and anything else, that's not going to-- %$* 532
that's not going to happen. %$* 532
i want to take-- %$* 13
i want to the point that i think you're making to karen kornbluh. %$* 13
and your opponents are basically saying that they acknowledge that people who are making the minimum wage would rather be making the minimum wage than less. %$* 13
they acknowledge, i think-- %$* 13
russell acknowledged that some people would be hurt immediately in their pocket books. %$* 13
but they're also saying that lots of people are not on the minimum wage. %$* 13
they're not working so the policy doesn't do anything for them and that it's-- %$* 13
more than half of poor people between the ages of 60 and 64 do not work. %$* 13
that policy does not nothing for them. %$* 13
and i want to have you respond to that piece of their argument. %$* 13
thank you, john, because i made the moral argument, but i think it's really important to get the economic argument right. %$* 535
and i think the economic argument sounds like it's on their side, but it's absolutely not. %$* 535
it's-- %$* 535
i like them both very much as well. %$* 535
i think good economics says that you have to make sure that you're not-- %$* 535
that you're actually looking at causality and that you're taking account of all of the variables. %$* 535
and what the economic studies really show is that there are a lot of other things that affect unemployment and that produce unemployment or employment. %$* 535
and those have to do with the overall state of the economy, has to do with education. %$* 535
and it's just overly simplistic-- %$* 535
but i'm-- %$* 13
analysis to say that-- %$* 535
that the minimum wage actually produces unemployment even %$* 535
but i'm actually bringing to you a different part of their argument, which is not the part of the argument where they're saying that it reduces employment. %$* 13
it's the part of their argument where they're saying it does no good for people who are not employed as a policy. %$* 13
number one, it expenses businesses as opposed to the taxpayer to help this sector of society. %$* 13
and number two, it doesn't do anything for people who don't literally have jobs. %$* 13
i think what we need to focus on, though, for those people-- %$* 535
and they've said it again and again, and i absolutely agree, and we can all go out agreeing on this, is, we need to improve our education system. %$* 535
we need to get access to vocational education. %$* 535
we need to get access to higher education. %$* 535
that's what you need in a knowledge economy. %$* 535
and so i think we all agree on what we need to do for those people. %$* 535
russ roberts. %$* 13
i want to just say something general about the empirical literature on the minimum wage. %$* 533
there have been hundreds of studies done on both sides, actually hundreds have found that the minimum wage reduces employment. %$* 533
that was the consensus among economists until the card and krueger study in the 1990s. %$* 533
and that consensus has shifted somewhat. %$* 533
now there are many economists who think that the effects are either small or minimal. %$* 533
again, i would emphasize that small to me does not mean it's irrelevant. %$* 533
small is still people's lives. %$* 533
but the point is that both-- %$* 533
just to clarify, does that mean you're conceding their points on the trend of the study now? %$* 13
oh, no. %$* 533
the trend is definitely-- %$* 533
there are definitely studies in respected journals that show little effect of the minimum wage on unemployment. %$* 533
and there are just as many studies on the other side saying, no, those studies are wrong. %$* 533
strangely enough, jared and karen, who i like very much-- %$* 533
seriously, i've been on many panels with jared. %$* 533
we have a good time. %$* 533
those studies haven't convinced-- %$* 533
those studies that show that there have been serious losses of jobs, which jim mentioned one of them, the sabia, burkhauser, hanson study of new york workers, 20 percent drop in workers without a high school diploma. %$* 533
that's an incredible tragedy. %$* 533
they don't find that persuasive. %$* 533
the study wasn't done well. %$* 533
strangely enough, we don't find the studies that find the other side persuasive as well. %$* 533
there's a big ideological gap between these two sides that we should be honest about, because if the studies were great, they would win. %$* 533
they would convince people. %$* 533
but the reason they don't convince people is that the world is a complicated place, as both karen and jared have said. %$* 533
there's a lot of things going on at once, and it's really hard to hold things constant. %$* 533
it gets a lot harder when the minimum wage affects a relatively small part of the population. %$* 533
so when 95 percent of jared-- %$* 533
if i want to accept some of your salaried workers, some slightly smaller percentage of the workers earn more than minimum wage already, yeah, it's going to be hard to tease out the independent effect of that relative to all the other things that change in the economy at the same time. %$* 533
so it's very hard to do. %$* 533
it's not persuasive to the opponents. %$* 533
i think that's-- %$* 534
i think that's a very fair-- %$* 534
jared bernstein. %$* 13
i think that's a very fair assessment of the literature. %$* 534
and, you know, you keep-- %$* 534
the other side keeps citing the work of david neumark. %$* 534
i think david neumark, he-- %$* 534
you've got-- %$* 534
has everybody read the david neumark? %$* 13
no, no. %$* 534
and his hundreds of studies. %$* 13
so you've got-- %$* 534
you know, the-- %$* 534
i thought russ described it well. %$* 534
you've got the krueger and card and a lot of other studies that showzero or slightly positive. %$* 534
david neumark and others show slightly-- %$* 534
now, i recently corresponded with neumark about this because we did a study at the center on budget-- %$* 534
we're doing a study. %$* 534
and we said, “david, what should we plug in to accurately represent the job loss effects that you, and our opposition, believe occurred? %$* 534
” because we want to be fair, just like i thought russ was pretty fair. %$* 534
and he said, essentially, a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage will lead to a 1 percent decline in the employment of teenage workers. %$* 534
now, if that occurs, that means that 99 percent of affected workers get a pay raise. %$* 534
now, our opponents have consistently said, if 1 percent loses a job or loses hours of work, yet somehow 99 percent get a raise, it's a bad deal. %$* 534
that's just, i think, economically a very-- %$* 534
a very misleading %$* 534
let's hear from jim dorn arguing to abolish the minimum wage. %$* 13
yeah, i want to address karen's point on the moral argument. %$* 532
can you respond-- %$* 13
would you respond to the point made? %$* 13
and i will come back to you on the moral argument-- %$* 13
yeah. %$* 532
only because i do want to explore that moral issue. %$* 13
but-- %$* 13
yeah, okay, responding to that point. %$* 532
most of these studies look at the short run, what happens in a very short period of time. %$* 532
and there's mostly modest increases in minimum wage that would lead to modest decreases in employment. %$* 532
and that shows up. %$* 532
but if you look at the long run, longer period of time where businesses that are just making marginal profits, and they can't increase prices much, they're going to cut back on low-skilled workers. %$* 532
and all workers aren't the same. %$* 532
all teenagers aren't the same. %$* 532
some are-- %$* 532
have better work ethics and so forth. %$* 532
so these are the workers that are going to be retained, and other workers are going to lose their jobs. %$* 532
and these workers that lose their jobs cannot come back and say, “okay, i'd be willing to work at the wage i worked at before.” this is the thing that i dislike about the minimum wage: it puts government in between the employer and the worker. %$* 532
it politicizes the decision about employment. %$* 532
instead of letting the worker who knows his or her alternatives best, come in and negotiate. %$* 532
now, they might say the worker has no bargaining power. %$* 532
well, if that were true, you could pay the worker anything you wanted. %$* 532
but if you pay workers too low, you see “help wanted” signs. %$* 532
employers want to hire workers, and they want to train workers, and they will spend money training workers. %$* 532
this happened in hong kong. %$* 532
you know, she points to hong kong. %$* 532
hong kong has been the number one economically freest country or region or special administrative region or whatever you want to call it in the world. %$* 532
china does not have a federal minimum wage. %$* 532
they have local minimum wages, and most of those local minimum wages, especially in the coastal areas, have been below the prevailing wage. %$* 532
the politicians there want to create jobs, and they know if the wage rate is too high, the official one, they won't create those jobs. %$* 532
jim, i want to-- %$* 13
the part of your argument i want to take to this side, which was very accessible to all of us, is the logic that he lays out that it's-- %$* 13
and to use the phrase that his partner used, if you "artificially make workers more expensive" then employers are going to adjust by not hiring them. %$* 13
that is a coherent logical argument, and i haven't heard you respond just to the logic of that argument. %$* 13
sure. %$* 534
that's a great question. %$* 534
like any other theoretical notion-- %$* 534
and it is a theoretical notion; a very cogent one, as you mentioned. %$* 534
it has to be empirically tested. %$* 534
you can't in economics-- %$* 534
this is not science, this is social science. %$* 534
it's different. %$* 534
you have to test it. %$* 534
and the tests that have been applied have been, i think, very careful pseudo- experimental kinds of tests, especially more recently, where as much as you can is held constant. %$* 534
and what those tests find is that you don't get the results that jim and russ have predicted. %$* 534
so you have to ask yourself what else is going on. %$* 534
and the other things that are going on are what i call the "three ps." there are three other ways that an increase in the minimum wage gets absorbed that have nothing to do with job losses: prices, productivity, and profits. %$* 534
okay? %$* 534
profits-- %$* 534
and as karen mentioned, corporate profitability is soaring at an all time high while compensation, by the way, as a share of national income is at a 50-year low. %$* 534
profits are redistributed somewhat when minimum wages go up to low wage workers. %$* 534
i think that's a good thing, given the trends that karen described. %$* 534
a very interesting and very positive impact is that you find that in the low wage labor market, a part of the economy that's fraught with turnover and vacancies, that goes down significantly. %$* 534
so productivity helps absorb some of the increase as well. %$* 534
and there's some price effects, too. %$* 534
but my question that i put to the other side, the day after the minimum wage is abolished, what happens to the workers who are making minimum wage now? %$* 13
they keep their jobs, they make less money? %$* 13
that's what you see happening? %$* 13
yeah. %$* 533
okay. %$* 13
russ roberts. %$* 13
well, jared and i agree on something very important, which is economics is not a science. %$* 533
that's good. %$* 533
it's a start. %$* 533
it's more like history with a lot of numbers. %$* 533
it's nothing like physics or the sciences. %$* 533
so to me, the word "social" in front of it, it's a very important qualifier. %$* 533
and i think the challenge is the empirical evidence that jared's talking about, i view as very unpersuasive. %$* 533
and it's-- %$* 533
i know it's unpersuasive because it doesn't persuade the opponents. %$* 533
no one reads these studies that are full of equations, and greek letters, and lots of fancy statistical work, and go, "oh, my gosh-- %$* 533
but can they be persuaded? %$* 13
"-- %$* 533
i've been wrong all my life." i don't know. %$* 533
it doesn't happen. %$* 533
yeah. %$* 13
in theory it could, but i-- %$* 533
everybody always says, "oh, they left this out. %$* 533
they didn't do this right." they always have a reason, and that's because of the fundamental complexity of human society. %$* 533
so i want to ask instead of that-- %$* 533
those kinds of studies which i don’t think persuade even economists, and they shouldn't persuade you, i want to ask you to do the following experiment. %$* 533
if you decided to quit your job, you didn't like your job, you were bored, you wanted to try something else, and now you're going to go out in the workplace and find a new job, but the government passes a law that for you to be-- %$* 533
when you go to your new job, your new employer has to pay you, say-- %$* 533
let's pick a small-- %$* 533
relatively small number, 20 percent more than your current job. %$* 533
that's the law. %$* 533
so you've switched jobs, you’ve got to get 20 percent more, do you think that would be good for you or bad for you? %$* 533
you realize-- %$* 533
and my question is to my opponents, do you think that would make it harder for you to find work? %$* 533
they're arguing that, "oh, empirically-- %$* 533
it's an empirical question. %$* 533
empirically, it doesn't have any effect when you artificially raise people's wages."so you, you have no extra skills, nothing new, you come into the workforce, "yay, the government's passed a law. %$* 533
you have to be paid 20 percent more than in your last job." would you be happy? %$* 533
would you be excited about that? %$* 533
i think you'd be scared. %$* 533
i would be. %$* 533
i think it's very difficult. %$* 533
all right, i want to go a few more-- %$* 13
i want to go a few more rounds. %$* 13
i want to go to karen kornbluh to respond to that, and then i do want to get to that moral question that jim dorn wants bring up. %$* 13
karen kornbluh. %$* 13
but before i respond to that, i just want to lay out another thought experiment, which is that if you are really serious, if you really thought that teenagers couldn't work at the minimum wage, and that it was keeping them out of the workforce, then what you might look at-- %$* 535
and some countries that have very, very high minimum wages have looked at this-- %$* 535
is a separate minimum wage for teens. %$* 535
we have a separate minimum wage for tip workers. %$* 535
i'm not saying those are something that i would-- %$* 535
that's something that i would endorse, but if you're really serious about a separate population needing to get entry, that's what you would do. %$* 535
i mean, we're very lucky. %$* 535
we have an easier case to make, because the proposition on the floor is abolishing the minimum wage. %$* 535
you do not have to go to abolishing the minimum wage to address the arguments that our opponents have brought up even if you take them at face value. %$* 535
jim dorn. %$* 13
yeah, i'll come back to this-- %$* 532
moral argument. %$* 532
if you think that people-- %$* 532
just in terms-- %$* 13
everybody's very timid on the applause. %$* 13
there's the beginning, because it's a radio broadcast. %$* 13
you ever listen to “wait, wait, don't tell me? %$* 13
” that's you. %$* 13
okay? %$* 13
that's %$* 13
but that show is funny. %$* 18
yes. %$* 13
let's go listen to it now. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
i would just want the laughter to stop so that i can get to jim dorn. %$* 13
jim dorn. %$* 13
now, i want to come back to this moral argument, because i think it's an important point. %$* 532
the question is whether individuals should be free to choose on their own terms, as long as there's not fraud involved and violence, to make themselves better off as they see it or whether the government should mandate a wage rate which may put you out of a job. %$* 532
if the government says the employer has to pay you $9 an hour and you're only producing $5 a hour, you're going to lose your job. %$* 532
now, why is the worker getting $5 an hour? %$* 532
because he or she doesn't have very many good alternatives. %$* 532
they don't have much education. %$* 532
so the real way you want to increase their income-- %$* 532
you increase the wage rate, they lose their job, their income is zero. %$* 532
how do you increase their real income over time? %$* 532
they have to have a better education. %$* 532
they have to have work habits. %$* 532
they don't get any work experience if they can't find a job. %$* 532
and people do lose their jobs. %$* 532
there's lots of evidence on this. %$* 532
douglas adie did a very good study showing that when the real minimum wage rate, that is, adjusted for inflation, increased by 10 percent, he found that there was a almost four percent increase in the unemployment rate for low-skilled workers, in the long run, after firms made adjustments. %$* 532
that's an economic-- %$* 532
that's what you'd expect from economic theory. %$* 532
the economic-- %$* 532
yeah, but are you saying then that more people would be working if there were no minimum wage? %$* 13
of course. %$* 532
so, let me-- %$* 534
let me-- %$* 534
jared bernstein. %$* 13
refine. %$* 534
jim and russ talk a lot about freedom-- %$* 534
interferes with workers' freedom. %$* 534
this is bad for workers. %$* 534
workers don't want this. %$* 534
so everybody's had a chance to do a thought experiment except me. %$* 534
so here’s the thought experiment. %$* 534
imagine a poll that asks a bunch of low-wage workers, “would you support abolishing the minimum wage? %$* 534
” okay? %$* 534
do that little thought experiment and see if that interferes with workers' freedom. %$* 534
in fact, 90 percent of americans earning less than 24,000 a year support raising the minimum wage. %$* 534
so go ask them about abolishing it and see what they say about their freedom to choose. %$* 534
well, ask this lady that lost her job in new hampshire. %$* 532
okay. %$* 534
now, listen, jim. %$* 534
if you're going to find one case of one person who loses their job and say, “we should abolish the minimum wage,” you're nuts. %$* 534
no, there's-- %$* 532
it's that simple. %$* 534
i mean, it-- %$* 534
and i am not-- %$* 534
i am not saying-- %$* 534
i am not saying you can't find that lady. %$* 534
in fact, the research-- %$* 534
there's 3.4 million-- %$* 532
i agreed with russ that the research shows there are small negative impacts from some studies. %$* 534
some studies show small positive impacts. %$* 534
russell roberts. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 533
and-- %$* 533
well, to jim, you were the one who was called nuts. %$* 13
do you want to-- %$* 13
yeah. %$* 533
i'll let jim go first. %$* 533
yeah. %$* 532
i don't believe in ad hominem attacks. %$* 532
obviously, it's an example. %$* 532
but-- %$* 532
but i like you. %$* 534
a personal example, it's something other than just a raw statistic. %$* 532
it's a human being. %$* 532
people should be free to choose. %$* 532
that's-- %$* 532
it's a free country. %$* 532
the government shouldn't be involved in this. %$* 532
it's-- %$* 532
okay. %$* 13
and i'm going to-- %$* 13
if the government-- %$* 532
go to russell-- %$* 13
okay? %$* 13
i'm only interrupting because you-- %$* 13
wasn't involved, would we go down the-- %$* 532
you have made that point-- %$* 13
yeah. %$* 532
and i want to-- %$* 13
okay. %$* 532
let russell-- %$* 13
yeah. %$* 533
i just want to say-- %$* 533
yeah, there's one person new hampshire, and there's another 3.4 million who are younger than that friend of jim's who don't have jobs right now, who want them, who aren't able to support their family and aren't able to get the meaningfulness out of life that a real job helps you achieve. %$* 533
thank you for the applause, but you're not supposed to do that. %$* 533
now, so i think, again, ask-- %$* 533
jared makes a good point. %$* 533
most minimum wage workers think it's a good thing. %$* 533
they won't if they lose their jobs, though. %$* 533
they're not experts in economics. %$* 533
they're not experts on thinking about how their businesses might respond. %$* 533
we're here to have a discussion and to think about these ideas. %$* 533
and again, ask yourself-- %$* 533
ask for your children, those of you who have children, would you want your child to go out into the workforce being only told they can only get a job if they can make at least $15 an hour or $20 an hour, or 25? %$* 533
$7.25, it turns out, not such a big hurdle, because 80 percent of teenagers are able to earn that anyway on top of it. %$* 533
so again, i would make the point, the minimum wage right now is fairly small and not as harmful as it would be if we raised it, for example, so we-- %$* 533
that is true. %$* 533
it's fairly small, but it's not small for the people whose lives are affected. %$* 533
karen, very quickly, because i want to go to questions. %$* 13
so, right after karen speaks, you can start raising your hands. %$* 13
we'll bring mics to you. %$* 13
karen. %$* 13
okay. %$* 535
so, i just-- %$* 535
sorry, russ. %$* 535
karen kornbluh. %$* 13
but you did just undermine your point completely-- %$* 535
great-- %$* 533
because you just said that the current minimum wage is not creating problems. %$* 535
your position is to abolish the minimum wage. %$* 535
where our-- %$* 535
it's not-- %$* 535
the question on the table is not whether to raise the minimum wage, it's whether to get rid of it entirely at its current, low rate. %$* 535
you're not quoting me quite accurately. %$* 533
i didn't say it wasn't causing any problems. %$* 533
i said the problems are relatively small and they're hard to measure. %$* 533
and as a result, it's relatively pleasant for most people because 95 percent of the people don't need it who aren't in the hourly-- %$* 533
who earn an hourly wage. %$* 533
i just think that we have to be really, really careful. %$* 535
i mean, you guys have tossed around a lot of studies. %$* 535
i think if we know that at our current low minimum wage, we are not causing problems, why on earth, because of some abstract notion or some theory about economics that's not proven in the empirical literature, do we want to subject low income families to an experiment of throwing out minimum wage which is a support for them and their families? %$* 535
because every worker who earns-- %$* 533
whose productivity is under $7.25 an hour right now is having a very difficult time making their way in the world, especially young workers. %$* 533
so that gets to the heart of the theory where i think russ and jim go wrong. %$* 534
what you just heard from russ is a standard econ 101 theory, which is, workers are paid their marginal product. %$* 534
they are paid what they contribute to their firm's value at the margin. %$* 534
now, if you believe that, you know very little about the actual labor market. %$* 534
let's go to some questions. %$* 13
ma'am, right in the middle there. %$* 13
so a mic will come to you down this side, and if you could just tell us who you are. %$* 13
i was going to stay stand up, because often we televise, but the-- %$* 13
we can't see you stand up on radio so it doesn't matter. %$* 13
and remember, make it terse and questioning. %$* 13
i was actually wondering-- %$* 19
wrong word. %$* 13
my name is emmy. %$* 19
i was wondering if you-- %$* 19
if both sides could speak to what role ballooning tuition costs, particularly for college and university, play in this debate? %$* 19
do we abolish the minimum wage when you consider that you have a workforce that has an increasing amount of debt as they enter initially into the work force, assuming they take on college or university education? %$* 19
okay. %$* 13
does that change your argument at all, that issue? %$* 13
i'm going to the side that's arguing for abolishing. %$* 13
i guess what she's saying is that you have to have a minimum wage for all these college graduates that can't get jobs. %$* 532
well, they won't get a job if the minimum wage is above the market wage. %$* 532
i would have a slightly different perspective on this. %$* 533
russ roberts. %$* 13
i think part of the problem we have with education right now is that we've subsidized it, which is a lovely idea. %$* 533
and as a result, it's pushed up tuition, and it's allowed colleges to raise their prices, their tuition a great deal. %$* 533
and as a result, many students have borrowed have a lot of money. %$* 533
and as a result, they're in big trouble. %$* 533
and especially in a downtime of economic growth when economic growth is so mediocre. %$* 533
okay. %$* 13
i just-- %$* 13
it's getting a little bit off the minimum wage issue. %$* 13
fair enough? %$* 13
but that's why i stopped you. %$* 13
karen kornbluh to respond. %$* 13
yeah, i do think this is really tied to the minimum wage issue because we have to remember that we live in a knowledge economy. %$* 535
and a country's human capital is what it competes on. %$* 535
and so what we need to do to be competitive, to have productivity, to have the american dream again, to have people earning high wages and being able to support their families is investing in people's education. %$* 535
and so we have a big problem in this country in terms of k-12, and we have a big problem in terms of-- %$* 535
okay, for the same reason, karen-- %$* 13
that's what we should adjust and not the minimum wage. %$* 535
all right. %$* 13
i'm going to step in. %$* 13
but your opponents made the very same argument at the beginning. %$* 13
and i was surprised when you said that you had the moral argument on their side because they were not saying "damn the poor" in any way. %$* 13
they were saying that they feel that the tool, the minimum wage, doesn't function correctly. %$* 13
and i've been wanting to get to that moral argument, but i was hoping somebody in the audience would actually bring it up. %$* 13
oh, no. %$* 535
so what i was saying is that i think the moral argument is on our side because those families need the minimum wage to support their kids. %$* 535
what they were saying is that somehow the minimum wage hurts those families and keeps them out of the workplace. %$* 535
i think the way you deal with people who are out of the workplace is you get education and training. %$* 535
okay. %$* 13
but they're saying the same thing. %$* 13
they're saying they care about the same people, but they're saying that the minimum wage hurts them. %$* 535
i'm saying the minimum wage helps them. %$* 535
okay. %$* 13
right again in the center. %$* 13
i know that's a pain with the microphone. %$* 13
i'll go to the wings after this. %$* 13
but you win. %$* 13
so the mic's coming to you. %$* 13
just wait for it so that the radio broadcast can hear you. %$* 13
oh, i'm sorry. %$* 13
you don't know who i'm talking about, do you? %$* 13
obviously. %$* 13
you can stand up. %$* 13
don't-- %$* 13
because i'm making eye contact. %$* 13
then the microphone will find you. %$* 13
there it is. %$* 13
great. %$* 13
hi. %$* 19
i'm a business owner in-- %$* 19
can you bring the mic-- %$* 13
hi. %$* 19
i'm a business owner in washington, d.c.where the minimum wage is $8.25 an hour. %$* 19
and i love the idea of worker freedom. %$* 19
when i think of one of my workers living in washington, d.c., on roughly $16,000 a year, they didn't take much in vacation, they'd have the freedom to choose, say, between rent or food or, you know, maybe healthcare. %$* 19
so my question goes to the notion of a living wage. %$* 19
if we don't pay our workers a living wage, then what we're asking is for the rest of the population to subsidize our businesses to bring those people up to a level where they can survive. %$* 19
and i'd just like the-- %$* 19
the taxpayer, you mean, yeah. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
the side arguing to abolish. %$* 13
the living wage isn't by the taxpayer. %$* 533
i think it's usually a proposal to just have a higher minimum wage that would be able to support a family more easily. %$* 533
what kind of business do you have? %$* 533
i'll repeat it for those-- %$* 533
since you have the mic. %$* 533
i have a consulting business. %$* 19
you have a consulting business. %$* 533
and your workers are paid-- %$* 533
you said you have some that are paid $8.25 an hour? %$* 533
no, i said that's the minimum wage in washington, d.c. %$* 19
so none of your workers earn the minimum wage. %$* 533
no. %$* 19
no. %$* 533
there are some who do, though, and that's very hard on them, and that's no doubt about it. %$* 533
right now there's a proposal with the city council of washington to increase the minimum wage for special stores that have large footprints. %$* 533
this would be stores like costco and home depot and super wal-mart. %$* 533
there are very few of those in washington, d.c.but they want to raise it to 11-something an hour. %$* 533
the washington post came out the other day and said it's a horrible idea because costco will leave. %$* 533
they won't be able to make a living, unfortunately. %$* 533
they have a lot of profit, but at $11.25, it's not clear they'll be able to keep that store in washington. %$* 533
and the washington post thinks that's a bad idea. %$* 533
i do too. %$* 533
i think it's a bad idea to-- %$* 533
especially to pick out special stores. %$* 533
what? %$* 533
ma'am, i need you to not debate with the debaters. %$* 13
but the question-- %$* 13

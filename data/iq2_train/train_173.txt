saudis like to live there. %$* 475
but they have a version of islam, that is repugnant to many americans, we can agree with that. %$* 475
we can agree that, saudi arabia, both privately and publicly, puts a lot of money into trying to spread their version of islam, this is what mr. %$* 475
marshall referred to as striving for a political order that represents a reactionary version of islam—yes. %$* 475
saudis are trying to do that. %$* 475
there are some other groups, around the world who are trying to do that. %$* 475
and some of them get money from the saudis. %$* 475
we’re not going to deny that. %$* 475
we’re not going to deny that women in many muslim countries face what asra said was an unacceptable situation. %$* 475
yeah, they do. %$* 475
many others don’t, but many do. %$* 475
nor are we going to claim that religious equality or enjoyment of human rights as we understand them in this country are universal in the muslim world. %$* 475
we’re not going to complain—to %$* 475
raise an issue on any of this. %$* 475
but that is what the proposition is. %$* 475
proposition is, the radicals dominate islam. %$* 475
now we’ve heard other words like, hegemony. %$* 475
after all, as daveed just said, 36 percent of british muslims think that apostasy deserves death, and that’s hegemony—well, not by my count. %$* 475
36 percent is 36 percent. %$* 475
you want a majority if you want hegemony. %$* 475
the fact that in britain, virtually all of the muslims come from one particular, rather benighted part of pakistan—and do not in any way, by any measure, represent a cross-section of the muslim world— should also be taken into account. %$* 475
see, the problem is, and let me go back to mr. %$* 475
rosenkranz’s very opening remarks. %$* 475
he was talking about numbers that showed that in muslim countries around the world you have a lot of people who are anti-american. %$* 475
we do, yeah. %$* 475
well, you know %$* 475
that i don’t think is un-understandable. %$* 475
but the question is whether that has anything to do with islam. %$* 475
or whether that is objecting to american policies. %$* 475
now, if you want to say that anyone who objects to us government actions is by definition a radical, well then maybe you get somewhere but even then i don’t think so because, what has not been talked about here, is the fact that most of the countries in the muslim world, are not governed by muslim regimes. %$* 475
they’re governed by autocratic dictatorships. %$* 475
most of the political activity of muslims, that gives rise to strong political statements has to do with opposing living under totalitarianism. %$* 475
most of the people in the muslim world, have not, nor did their parents, nor will their grandchildren in all likelihood, had any opportunity, to participate in or choose the government under what they live. %$* 475
now, the fact of the matter is, that when they object to autocratic rule, two things happen. %$* 475
one is, that they fall back on their religious faith, and say, well, islam can help us against this autocracy, the second one is, they say, who is supporting the dictatorships that we live in. %$* 475
lo and behold, say it’s the united states. %$* 475
so that when you have muslims objecting to us policies, it’s more frequently that they are objecting to the support the united states gives to autocratic rule, whether it is in egypt, or in saudi arabia, or in pakistan. %$* 475
this is the crux of the matter in the muslim world. %$* 475
you don’t have %$* 475
most muslims in the muslim world are not sitting there trying to decide whether they want a saudi, conservative, puritanical version of islam, or whether they want, you know, reza aslan to be the muslim pope, i mean this is not— this is not where the debate is, it isn’t about what islam is like. %$* 475
good debate, yeah. %$* 475
what it’s about, is a billion people, two-thirds of whom do not live in democratic systems, and who are looking to their tradition and their faith tradition, to try to work for a better life, and a more participatory role, in the polities that they live in. %$* 475
and they find that, islam is satisfying to them as a political option. %$* 475
it isn’t the option that most of us would choose but we do know that in this country, we do have many americans, who feel that religion is part of their political life. %$* 475
unless i miss my guess, this accounts for a big chunk of the republican party. %$* 475
but we sort of say, well, okay, here in new york we don’t particularly like to talk about those people, but— %$* 475
—nevertheless, the fact of the matter is that these people find satisfaction in their turn to religion as an effort to stand up against autocracy, and they find that the american support for autocrats is reprehensible. %$* 475
and they discover that in the american way of things there will be enormous publicity given to anything negative about islam, not just by the american press, but because the various autocrats will feed the american government and the american press negative things because they’re trying to protect the privileged position that they have set up over the last 50 years of totalitarian rule. %$* 475
and therefore i would say that, if there’s anything that’s dominating in the muslim world, not dominating in islam but dominating in the muslim world, it’s dictatorship. %$* 475
not radical muslims. %$* 475
good debate though. %$* 470
good debate, yeah. %$* 475
what it’s about, is a billion people, two-thirds of whom do not live in democratic systems, and who are looking to their tradition and their faith tradition, to try to work for a better life, and a more participatory role, in the polities that they live in. %$* 475
and they find that, islam is satisfying to them as a political option. %$* 475
it isn’t the option that most of us would choose but we do know that in this country, we do have many americans, who feel that religion is part of their political life. %$* 475
unless i miss my guess, this accounts for a big chunk of the republican party. %$* 475
but we sort of say, well, okay, here in new york we don’t particularly like to talk about those people, but— %$* 475
one. %$* 33
—nevertheless, the fact of the matter is that these people find satisfaction in their turn to religion as an effort to stand up against autocracy, and they find that the american support for autocrats is reprehensible. %$* 475
and they discover that in the american way of things there will be enormous publicity given to anything negative about islam, not just by the american press, but because the various autocrats will feed the american government and the american press negative things because they’re trying to protect the privileged position that they have set up over the last 50 years of totalitarian rule. %$* 475
and therefore i would say that, if there’s anything that’s dominating in the muslim world, not dominating in islam but dominating in the muslim world, it’s dictatorship. %$* 475
not radical muslims. %$* 475
richard bulliet, thank you very much for your opening statement. %$* 33
before the panelists put questions to one another i have a couple of questions, and first, richard bulliet. %$* 33
would you agree or disagree with the statement that muslim clergy worldwide is dominated by people who would want to see islamic law imposed in their societies and would prefer to live in a society under islamic law, do you think it’s true or false or no way of knowing. %$* 33
oh, i think that’s false, i held a conference a number of years ago, exclusively devoted to muslim political activists, held it in iman, jordan. %$* 475
and one of the issues that we were supposed to discuss was the idea of an islamic republic. %$* 475
there wasn’t a single person there. %$* 475
they were muslim political activists—? %$* 472
yes they were, they were from the muslim brotherhood, they were from the dawa party, they’re from the sciri party. %$* 475
they were from a whole series of muslim political parties in the middle east. %$* 475
mm-hmm. %$* 472
and none of them supported the idea of an islamic republic. %$* 475
hmm. %$* 472
and you believe that from a group whose message was the koran is our constitution— %$* 474
daveed gartenstein-ross. %$* 33
i mean, the muslim brotherhood is very clear on what their goals are. %$* 474
hassan al-banna, talked about this, %$* 474
it was in the 1930s— %$* 475
—islamic state, and— %$* 474
yes, but— %$* 475
—their motto remains, the koran is our constitution— %$* 474
you’re mistaking the 1930s or the 1950s with the muslim brotherhood today— %$* 475
okay, mohammed %$* 474
—talks about pluralism primarily. %$* 475
i have a question for daveed gartenstein-ross, before—you’ll goad each other in just a moment here and i’ll— %$* 33
okay— %$* 474
okay, daveed gartenstein-ross, you seem to cite as evidence of the fact that muslims are dominated by radicals, the desire to see restrictions in europe on freedom of speech that included cartoons that muslims deemed blasphemous. %$* 33
in europe, in britain for that matter, there are laws that restrict incitement to race hate, which we find a violation of our first amendment, do you believe that laws that ban punishment of racist or anti- semitic or anti-islamist images or literature—that to support such laws is a mark of an extremist, or in the context of europe, is it a part of the way in which the law has developed there that has not created fascist societies in france, italy and britain recently— %$* 33
well, you have to parse some of those laws, i mean there’s the racial incitement laws which is one thing, and i don’t have a problem with racial incitement laws. %$* 474
then there’s vilification laws. %$* 474
vilification laws are adopted in some countries, france and italy are examples. %$* 474
most countries in europe do not have it, including britain. %$* 474
i do think—in terms of those, it’s debatable as to why a country would have it, whether it’s evidence of radicalism. %$* 474
but i think saying that every country in the world should adopt a certain law to limit speech in the case of religion, is evidence of radicalism— %$* 474
but if a religious movement pressed for universal laws that would ban degrading images or comments about their faith, would you take that as per se a mark of extremism on behalf of that faith— %$* 33
not—not per se a mark of extremism, i agree with that but i think that contextually i would define it as such, it looks like paul has something he wants to— %$* 474
paul marshall, you have something to add— %$* 33
yeah, depends what the government is, you have through the organization of islamic confernce an effort going on, since about 1999, to repress through the international system, to repress speech it says is critical of islam, or blasphemous. %$* 470
pakistan has been big on this, iran has been big on this, the saudis have been big on this. %$* 470
remember, example, brief example i gave before is saudi democracy activists are accused of blasphemy. %$* 470
in iran, akbar gangi, the major dissident, was accused of insulting islam. %$* 470
domestically these repressive regimes use charges of blasphemy to squelch the opposition, basically they say, we represent islam, you criticize us, you criticize islam, you’re a blasphemer. %$* 470
when these regimes try to pushy this into the international sphere i think it should be strongly opposed. %$* 470
but when you have autocratic regimes— %$* 475
and richard bulliet— %$* 33
—that ban parties that use religion and so forth, you don’t object to that. %$* 475
the egyptians will not allow a religious party, the turks, you know, through constitutional court, they’re now trying to ban the governing party there, i mean %$* 475
i don’t like that either— %$* 470
a governing—a governing party by the way which calls itself islamist and yet, has brought seven years of unprecedented economic growth, has brought turkey closer to the united states and israel than it’s ever been before, has given more freedoms and rights to minorities, and ethnic minorities than it has ever been before, but— they want to say that it’s okay if you’re a woman, and you want to go to college, you can put a scarf over your head, and, because of that, they’re seen as anti-democratic, as violating secularism, as, you know, again this awful world islamist. %$* 471
so, you know, it’s not so easy to just kind of tag the muslim brotherhood or the akp as though the muslim brotherhood by the way is one entity. %$* 471
according to something that was written in the 1930s, you know, by hassan al-banna— %$* 471
well, i’ll quote the current guardian if you want. %$* 470
you can— %$* 471
well, we can quote them as we go on through the evening. %$* 33
we can quote all of the muslim brethren before we’re done, but now, i’m sure you’ve all been wondering what the person next to you really thinks about all this. %$* 33
and now you’ll learn because i’m ready to announce the results of the pre- debate vote. %$* 33
before you were moved by the speakers, you were asked your opinion of the motion, “islam is dominated by radicals.” 46 percent voted for the motion, 32 percent against, and 22 percent were undecided. %$* 33
now we’re going to continue with the discussion section of the evening. %$* 33
i’m going to ask each of you if you have a question for an individual on the other side. %$* 33
and again, we’d like to hear a question put to the person on the other side and first i’m going to ask paul marshall, do you have a question for one of your adversaries here. %$* 33
yes, professor bulliet. %$* 470
in arguing, you opposed our use of the word “hegemony,” and said when, say, 30 percent or so of british muslim youth want to kill someone who rejects islam, or believes they should be killed, you said that’s not a majority, hegemony equals majority. %$* 470
but, would you not agree that in the regimes we’re talking about, if one is talking about egypt, or saudi arabia, or a vast number of other countries, the majority of the people may oppose something. %$* 470
but surely you would agree that currently the saudi arabian government is hegemonic, the iranian government is hegemonic in terms of what shapes that country. %$* 470
oh, i agree— %$* 475
richard bulliet. %$* 33
yes, i mean— %$* 475
no, just stop there— %$* 470
the british— the british government isn’t, however, in that category. %$* 475
if you are going to say that the government in any autocratic state, whether it is saudi arabia, or iran or egypt, or tunisia, or any of the other myriad autocratic states where the government calls the shots, yes. %$* 475
the government does call the shots and therefore you could say that the government has a dominating or hegemonic role but if you want to go down that route, then you find that most muslims in the world aren’t living in those states that you’re worried about. %$* 475
they’re living in states that are governed by nationalists, secular, or self-proclaimed secular autocracies, so, you know, you can’t just single out saudi arabia and iran, and say, this is the whole of the law and the prophets—it just doesn’t work that way. %$* 475
question asked and answered, reza aslan, do you have a question for the other side, someone on the other side. %$* 33
yes, i’ll ask this question of daveed. %$* 471
i want to remind daveed first of all that, according to freedom’s house definition of democracies, the united states wasn’t a democracy until 1960.but in that regard, rice university two years ago did the most comprehensive study of american religiosity ever done. %$* 471
and in that study they found that not only do a third of americans, one out of three refer to themselves as evangelical christians, but 46 percent, that’s almost half of american christians, believe that the constitution and american laws should be changed in order to match christian law and christian values, so— %$* 471
your question. %$* 33
—i imagine your response would be— no, do you or do you not then believe that america is under the “hegemony” %$* 471
of evangelical christians. %$* 471
so therefore we are dominated by radicals, correct? %$* 471
well— %$* 474
daveed gartenstein-ross. %$* 33
—that would be a very relevant and interesting question if this were a different resolution. %$* 474
in the end the resolution isn’t whether the us is dominated by radicals or not. %$* 474
now— %$* 474
no, i’m just curious about your answer— %$* 471
only get one question, yes— %$* 33
i mean, looking at the specifics of it, it was 46 percent of 23 percent, i think, i don’t know, that seems to be about, 11 and a half percent, my math could be a little bit off, you kind of went on for a little while there. %$* 474
but what i will say is evidence of hegemony, is when— %$* 474
no, no, 46 percent of 300 million, not— %$* 471
46 percent— %$* 474
—46 percent of 100— %$* 471
—of 300 million think that—well, i’d have to see the study, and one thing that i can say is that i think that in the evangelical community, which i’m a part of, there’s a lot of push-back against— i mean you were, you’re going on and on about the akp, and i actually agree with you on the akp, i don’t think they should be banned. %$* 474
but there’s a— there’s disagreement here but, i don’t think they should be banned— %$* 474
no, no, no, i just like turkey. %$* 470
okay— %$* 474
the akp is the turkish— %$* 33
the akp is just— %$* 474
—islamist party— %$* 33
but, with respect to the united states, within the evangelical community there’s a lot of push-back against religion simply being pushed out of the sphere, the public sphere, 100 percent, that’s the way the first amendment has been interpreted for some time. %$* 474
and i would say that some of the disturbing poll results are not evidence of radicalism but instead, this push- back— %$* 474
so it’s not hegemony— %$* 471
the question—the question is answered— %$* 33
actually it wasn’t. %$* 471
and—well, it’s,— %$* 33
actually it was, reza, but i appreciate your— %$* 474
it is a sign of hegemony or it is not a sign of hegemony. %$* 471
um— %$* 474
46 percent wanting to— %$* 471
well actually i answered it— %$* 474
—to enforce christianity— %$* 471
which is that the question is not relevant. %$* 474
and i don’t know what way they’d wanna do it, i haven’t seen the poll results, i can’t judge. %$* 474
thank you, daveed gartenstein-ross. %$* 33
a question now, asra nomani, you can put a question to one of the opponents of the motion. %$* 33
well, edina said earlier that to suggest that radicals dominate-- %$* 472
as is our proposition there-- %$* 472
islam is like saying that murderers define america. %$* 472
so, 22 countries are the number of countries that declare that islam is the state religion. %$* 472
of those, 14 say that conversion of islam is illegal. %$* 472
the good professor suggested that in fact we are correct that, islamic law in saudi arabia and all of these other countries suggest inequity. %$* 472
so my question to you, thank you— %$* 472
good point. %$* 33
—is %$* 472
the laws are defined by ideology that— represents inequity. %$* 472
most of the countries are governed by islamic states, in the name of islam. %$* 472
how do you then argue that, there—the excuse is autocracies, that the equivalent is as if murderers were running america. %$* 472
these countries are not the—the leadership does not even proclaim to be running the country in the name of islam. %$* 473
again— %$* 473
well, they have islam as their state religion— %$* 472
if i can answer— %$* 473
—under islamic law. %$* 472
you’ve asked the question. %$* 33
the answer? %$* 33
the islamic law has been on the books for a period of time in these countries. %$* 473
the leaders who are coming into the leadership, are dictators who are following upon the heels of dictators, and who are supported by international forces. %$* 473
the fact that these laws exist on the books, are indeed still problematic. %$* 473
no one on our side is denying any of that, these realities certainly exist on the ground. %$* 473
however, we have to look at where they are enforced and when they are enforced. %$* 473
because even where islamic law— and we try to take sharia and turn it into, as if it’s “the” sharia, that it’s a one-size-fits-all sharia that exists in all of these countries, nothing could be further from the proof. %$* 473
there is different shapes and sizes and flavors of sharia that exist in these different countries. %$* 473
so we cannot pretend that they are all the same. %$* 473
so, in these situations, in some of these countries, even those rules around apostasy have long been unenforced. %$* 473
we have to look at where this rise has come from. %$* 473
and a lot of it, in my mind, is a very reactionary action that has taken place. %$* 473
and again, in no way defines what is taking place on the ground with the people, i do not know why we are once again, over and over again denying the realities of the people on the groined who make up the dominant force within islam. %$* 473
because this is not a homecoming queen contest. %$* 472
and no one said it was. %$* 473
edina lekovic, it’s your turn to put a question to any of the three supporters, movers of the motion. %$* 33
well, my question is for paul marshall. %$* 473
last week, general petraeus testified before congress and said that the iraqi people are turning on al qaeda, and that they are fighting them, and that this is resulting in a reduced presence of al qaeda in iraq. %$* 473
and that this is a—and we see this as a rare glimpse of success in our war policy. %$* 473
and pundits, and scholars, including journalists who have been on the ground, in some of the very countries that we are talking about, have also said that these— al qaeda being the prime example, but other radical groups on the ground, that their influence is also declining. %$* 473
do you dispute that fact. %$* 473
okay. %$* 470
just one quick comment, edina, you are being very unfair. %$* 470
as you know, i was on my honeymoon last week, and did not pay too much atten— %$* 470
i’m very jealous— %$* 473
the only person who didn’t pay too much attention to what general petraeus said. %$* 470
but the %$* 470
i would be, i wouldn’t have enough knowledge of on the ground in iraq to dispute that. %$* 470
but it may well be the case that sort of more radical forces, not just the al qaeda types, but the mahdi army and these other groups, that the iraqis are sort of getting fed up with them and resisting them. %$* 470
this may well be the case. %$* 470
and, obviously, i would regard that, i think most of us would regard that as a good thing. %$* 470
but it would not, for me, make a difference in terms of my overall view of dominant trends in the muslim world, in africa, asia—south asia, southeast asia and so forth. %$* 470
a question now, from daveed gartenstein-ross for one of the opponents of the resolution. %$* 33
all right, i’m going to ask it to reza since we seem to be the two boxers of the bunch. %$* 474
and it will—my question will not go on and on and on, rather, it’s— %$* 474
and i’ll— %$* 471
—somewhat to the point— %$* 474
and i’ll actually answer it. %$* 471
touché— %$* 474
you both set a very high standard for this event— %$* 33
it’s really impressive. %$* 473
so, i’m interested actually in your answer. %$* 474
you talked about the polls on violence during your first speech. %$* 474
my question is, first of all do you still find the raw numbers disturbing, i talked a bit about the pew study on indonesia, 15 percent equates to 25 million people who support violence in the name of the religion. %$* 474
and then second, do you find it disturbing, regardless of whether they name religion as one of their motivating factors for it, which was one of the points that you made as well. %$* 474
actually what you said was 15 percent of indonesians would resort to violence in defense of their religion, i can’t believe it’s as little as 15 percent. %$* 471
i would be shocked if it were less than 50 percent. %$* 471
religion in every culture including ours, is not just beliefs and practices, it’s identity. %$* 471
and if someone were coming to my country to attack me, attack my identity, you’re damn right, i would resort to violence to deflect that attack. %$* 471
now, you made the point that, we would assume that, ask a bunch of american christians that same question and of course it—the number would be much less than 15 percent. %$* 471
i think you’re right. %$* 471
however, let’s ask a bunch of christians— %$* 471
but, pugilistically, when andres serrano’s— %$* 474
why don’t we— %$* 471
—piss christ came out, christians weren’t rioting on the streets. %$* 474
whereas with the danish cartoons you had over 100 people killed throughout the world. %$* 474
yeah, actually nigerian christians were massacring with machetes muslims, just as muslims were massacring christians. %$* 471
but let me just say, it may be right that, you’re not going to get similar numbers of christians if you ask let’s say americans, but ask that question of guatemalans. %$* 471
ask that question of people in san salvador. %$* 471
and i think you’re going to get a different answer. %$* 471
religion is who you are, if who you are is under attack, you fight back, period, whether you’re a christian, or whether you’re a muslim. %$* 471
the reason that we—there are so few americans who feel that way is— i mean saying that my religion is under attack because i can’t pray in my classroom, is not being under attack. %$* 471
as opposed to there being cartoons ridiculing your religion? %$* 474
yeah, as a matter of fact, yeah, as that’s— %$* 471
as a—oh, as a matter of fact, so you do think that it’s okay to riot in response to, you think that that’s okay— %$* 474
i think it’s perfectly okay to protest those cartoons. %$* 471
and to kill people? %$* 474
no, but that’s— %$* 471
over 100 people died. %$* 474
no, no, no, but that’s different, what you’re saying is, should i act in defense of my religion— %$* 471
clearly, to commit acts of violence, it’s not act in defense of religion— %$* 474
should i act—should i act violently— %$* 471
it’s commit acts of violence, that’s what the survey said— %$* 474
should i act violently in defense of my religion, absolutely. %$* 471
if the—if what that means is, that it’s my identity, that people are on the ground attacking me— %$* 471
and this goes to show why islam is dominated by radicals— %$* 474
it’s sort of— no. %$* 471
it’s a very %$* 471
no, no. %$* 474
it’s just, it’s a— %$* 471
sorry, dude, i got the last applause line. %$* 474
it’s a very superficial and unsophisticated view of religion to think that what we’re talking about here is if someone is offended by something about their religion— %$* 471
so the people— %$* 474
—then they’ll react with violence— %$* 471
—who died should yield to the fact that— %$* 474
when people act— %$* 471
—they’re unsophisticated— %$* 474
when people are acting— %$* 471
—in their knowledge that they died. %$* 474
when people are asked, would you resort to violence to defend your religion, i guarantee you that the people in indonesia who answered that question, were not talking about being offended, they were talking about actually defending their lives and livelihood which by the way is a very real thing, when you see the war on terror being understood— %$* 471
it’s also very real in indonesia— %$* 474
—not just in the muslim world— %$* 471
—four islands to be directed %$* 474
one last %$* 33
—as an attack on islam, this isn’t just egyptians or jordanians or iraqis who think this. %$* 471
these are british non-muslims who think this. %$* 471
around the world, the majority view is that the war on islam is a war against muslim identity, it’s a— %$* 471
war on terror— %$* 33
it’s—i mean i’m sorry, the war on terror, is a war against muslim identity, this is a— %$* 471
on that note— %$* 33
—very real issue. %$* 471
i think— %$* 33
so if i’m asked %$* 471
are you—would you react if someone were to violate your beliefs, in defense of your beliefs— %$* 471
yes. %$* 33
—then we’re not talking about being offended. %$* 471
but reza, you were asked— %$* 33
that’s not what we’re talking about— %$* 474
—and you’ve answered the question. %$* 33
and we have one last question from a panelist for the other side from richard bulliet. %$* 33
yeah, i’ll—i think we’ve gotten too serious, we’ll move on to some whimsy. %$* 475
so this is for daveed. %$* 475
you finished your, your talk with, what struck me as an absolute absurdity, namely that the price of oil is somewhat equatable to the dominance of radical islam. %$* 475
and it made me think, gee %$* 475
if we can only solve our energy problem, will radical islam go away? %$* 475
because, you’re making a remark— the only person who has ever really pursued this in print was dan pipes in his first book, saying that, radical islam is purely a product of oil prices—i think it’s an absurdity. %$* 475
well, it—well, okay, the way you frame it it is, but that’s not what i said. %$* 474
what i said, going off edina’s remarks that saudi arabia is radical, is i talked about how the fact—how i used to work for a saudi charity that did propagate radical material. %$* 474
so i’ve seen this firsthand, and can say that saudi charity, saudi institutions, saudi imams, make a difference throughout the world. %$* 474
and the reason why they’re so widespread, is indeed because saudi arabia has a lot of money to spend, due to its oil revenues. %$* 474
the point i was making was simply that oil revenues aren’t going to dry up any time soon. %$* 474
rather, the price of oil is skyrocketing. %$* 474
and as a result, these institutions are out there, far more than they were before. %$* 474
that goes to the point of hegemony. %$* 474
that goes to who has the power— %$* 474
oh, that—but let’s— %$* 475
—who has the money, who’s installing the imams. %$* 474
and indeed— %$* 474
that goes to the point— %$* 475
—of whether the saudis are trying to export— %$* 475
—their form of religion. %$* 475
and we’re perfectly willing to grant, the saudis are trying to export it, but you haven’t demonstrated that the efforts the saudis are making, are actually succeeding. %$* 475
all you’ve done is saying that they’re doing it— %$* 475
okay, but we actually talked about that, paul talked about that in the very first speech. %$* 474
where he talked about the changes in islam, in places like indonesia, in the balkans, in somalia, look at somalia. %$* 474
where you have a war wracking the country, where the group formerly known as the islamic courts union, now known as the alliance for reliberation of somalia, managed to conquer the country, impose islamic law in which people were arrested for watching pretty in pink, in which a karate instructor who had female students was arrested, where people were arrested for watching the world cup. %$* 474
that stuff was unheard of in somalia 30 years ago. %$* 474
and now—and today, that is the reality on the ground. %$* 474
so i can say for a fact, that yes, this oil money and this dawa, is making a difference, and it’s making a difference in the way that affects people’s lives. %$* 474
okay. %$* 33
you’re probably wanting to get in on this conversation— and now you can join in this civil discourse on the question of whether islam is dominated by radicals. %$* 33
we have microphones out in the audience, and if you’d like to raise your hand, the people bearing the microphones will find you. %$* 33
i’d like you to please not start to ask a question until we do have a microphone in front of you, and make your questions short and to the point. %$* 33
and if you are member of the press, please identify yourself as such. %$* 33
i’m a little bit blinded by the light, so i’m trying to see— up in the left, yes, question— %$* 33
my name is james taranto and i am a member of the press— %$* 476
good— %$* 33
—i’m with the wall street journal. %$* 476
i—this question is for any or all on the side for the motion. %$* 476
has the—to what extent has—or on the whole let’s say, has, have the political changes in iraq over the past five years strengthened or weakened the domination of islam by radicals. %$* 476
in— %$* 474
this is daveed gartenstein-ross, you want to answer that? %$* 33
okay, sure. %$* 474
i think that the changes in iraq have had both effects. %$* 474
on the one hand, i think the iraq war has clearly been a rallying point for radicals, and whether that’s justifiable or unjustifiable is something that people can decide on their own. %$* 474
but clearly, it’s been a great recruiting ground for al qaeda and others. %$* 474
the flip-side of that is that, we had some discussion before of the anti-jihadist movements that are there, things like the sakwa movement. %$* 474
and those have had a cognizably good impact. %$* 474
i think on the whole, uh, the fighting there is something that is energizing of radicals in the muslim world without a question. %$* 474
and that’s not going to stop regardless of the sakwa movement. %$* 474
where is our next question coming from, on the right. %$* 33
first of all i think this has been addressed on, pretty much one level, “islam is dominated by radicals” has a multitude of meanings. %$* 10
not just political, and i was very moved at what miss nomani said, talking about the—how women were treated in this religion. %$* 10
and, i don’t know obviously, i’m not an expert on the muslim religion, but i do know several women in new york who go to mosques and are placed in separate areas who cannot go out with a man or be seen with a man without a chaperone. %$* 10
and any union has to be %$* 10
has to be validated by the head of the mosque.— %$* 10
question— %$* 33
—i think, i think—and this, my question is to edina. %$* 137
what do you think of the absolute bare-bones question of, as i say, microcosms grow into macrocosms, of bare-boned questions of human rights in that issue. %$* 137
bare-bones questions of human rights, well %$* 473
okay. %$* 473
when it comes to the issue of women in mosques, what we see— i can speak again anecdotally and i can speak empirically, it’s a matter of what the audience would like to hear. %$* 473
when it comes to anecdotal things, you said something about the union of marriages, in any church the union of two people must be sanctified by that, by that religious institution. %$* 473
on the question of chaperones, there is, it in many ways, is a product of culture than of religion. %$* 473
there is what has been practiced by my family for generations is what is then being practiced. %$* 473
i think this question of religion and culture and the weaving of the two, is one of the central questions that we face within the global muslim community today. %$* 473
and the reality is that islam looks and feels and tastes different, no matter where you go. %$* 473
regardless of who is in power, because of the question of culture and of identity that we are considering here. %$* 473
is there a very real— %$* 473
including on the subject— %$* 33
yeah, is there a very real— %$* 473
—particularly about the women. %$* 33
is there a very real problem, when it comes to the treatment of women in mosques and in human rights issues, absolutely. %$* 473
is it the dominant force for muslim women and their lives? %$* 473
i would argue with that point. %$* 473
because i, based again on my travels, on my experience, and on my interaction with the data that’s out there, there are just as many women who are, when they have an education, when they have access %$* 473
and that’s, again, we have dividing lines, we can’t separate the question of human rights, when there is a lack of education, where there is poverty, where there are these surrounding issues, it is not simply a matter of, of, you know, of religious teachings. %$* 473
because, there are, you have the benazir bhuttos. %$* 473
you have the women heads of state in bangladesh and pakistan and indonesia and other places. %$* 473
you have queen noor of jordan and queen rania, you have these other examples that exist out there, and they are just as much role models for muslim women as are the problems that they are facing. %$* 473
these are both—these are two sides of the same reality, but absolutely, there’s a very real problem on the ground, and it’s one that is being faced by ngo’s, by civil society groups, and by women themselves on the ground. %$* 473
and that’s what i— that’s what i’m really trying to put the attention on here. %$* 473
is that there is an active fight taking place on the ground. %$* 473
an active fight. %$* 473
and there has to be a fight because— there has to be a fight, i want to just make the point again— %$* 472
asra nomani— %$* 33
—there has to be a fight because the leadership is dominated by radicalism. %$* 472
and by patriarchy— %$* 473
in— yes, patriarchy is a form of radicalism if you ask me— %$* 472
as it is in other parts of the— %$* 473
sure, but— %$* 472
—non-muslim world— %$* 473
right, but unfortunately, our society, our muslim society is defined right now by a patriarchy that, the christian and jewish societies have evolved beyond. %$* 472
you’re confused— %$* 471
oh, i’m sorry. %$* 472
i’m sorry, i didn’t just get censored in dubai because i wanted to talk about women’s rights. %$* 472
oh, i’m sorry, the mosque up the street didn’t tell me that i couldn’t pray in the main hall, because that’s not what a woman’s supposed to do. %$* 472
oh, i’m sorry, those men that surrounded me— %$* 472
orthodox synagogues— %$* 471
excuse me— %$* 472
reza— %$* 33
—orthodox synagogues are a portion— %$* 472
catholic churches— %$* 471
excuse me— %$* 472
—women can’t become priests— %$* 471
they’re a portion of— %$* 472
—they can’t serve, you know— %$* 471
they’re a portion of the jewish community but the end of the day— %$* 472
absolutely, patriarchy’s— %$* 471
—orthodox— %$* 472
—everywhere. %$* 471
—orthodox ideology is what defines our communities. %$* 472
two out of three mosques in america do not even allow a woman on the board. %$* 472
that is a statistic— %$* 472
but, from where— %$* 471
—that is— %$* 472
whose statistic is that, it’s very— %$* 473
that’s the council— %$* 472
—easy to throw these things out there— %$* 473
—council on american-islamic relations who are, consider themselves the naacp of the muslim world fighting for women’s rights. %$* 472
i mean this is the reality. %$* 472
we can talk politics, we can talk all sorts of, you know, dictatorships, ultimately, we’re dealing with bullies in the community who want to push their radical ideology— %$* 472
asra nomani, but it would be—one could infer from what you’ve said that, a hundred—at the start of the last century that all of western civilization was dominated by extremists. %$* 33
and have we not gotten at least some movement where we have churches now, where we have women as priests. %$* 472
where we have catholic women who are— %$* 472
and they’re still fighting— %$* 473
—fighting for the right to— %$* 472
they are fighting— %$* 473
we have mosques where women are imams, so— %$* 471
oh, really. %$* 472
very small percentage— %$* 471
i’d love to go to them, in china, in some rural areas, oh, i’ll take a trip there but, i don’t think— %$* 472
oh, no, in the united states— %$* 471
oh, really, reza, tell me where i could go— %$* 472
absolutely, there’s a zaytuna institute, the only seminar— %$* 471
right— %$* 472
—in the united states— %$* 471
right— %$* 472
—trains as many women— %$* 471
right— %$* 472
—imams as— %$* 471
women imams to teach— %$* 472
—as it trains male imams— %$* 471
—the women. %$* 472
you know, because they’re acceptable for the sisters, but at the end of the day, they’re not good enough for the men— %$* 472
another que— %$* 33
and that to me is unacceptable. %$* 472
another question from the audience. %$* 33
here, sir. %$* 33
i’d like to ask about islam, from the standpoint of its own historical context, rather than from the prism of our absolute, individual standards or mixing the muslim apple with the christian orange if you will, which doesn’t take us very far. %$* 9
if we begin, say 950 years ago, when islam was arguably the intellectual capitol of the world, since then there’s clearly been a trend of insularity and anti-intellectualism in the past thousand years, assuming that is true, what has been the trend in terms of tolerance, and radicalism, and in particular, not just the last thousand years but the last 100 and last 50 years. %$* 9
dick bulliett— %$* 33
you can handle that, dick— %$* 471
i’d like to ask about that, it—you made a statement then you said, “assuming that to be true.” well, that’s a big assumption. %$* 475
you’re talking about 950 years, you’re talking about roughly the year 1100. right? %$* 475
okay. %$* 475
it is a commonplace—the history of western culture, that europe was behind at one point, and then at a certain point islam stagnated and became backward, whereas europe leapt ahead, and created the modern world. %$* 475
thanks to islam, in large part. %$* 9
in large part, based on borrowings in one way or another from islam. %$* 475
but the notion that islam stagnated is contrary to historical fact in certain ways. %$* 475
in particular, over half of all the people in the world today who are muslims, are the descendants of people who converted to islam after this alleged period of stagnation. %$* 475
islam’s greatest success, in terms of the growth of a faith community, was in the period when europeans are claiming that, uh, that islam was stagnant. %$* 475
what happened in that period, was that you had an enormous, and very complex, interaction of islam with communities in all parts of the world %$* 475
east asia, southeast asia, south asia, africa, europe, eastern europe and so forth, and islam became immensely richer and more complex, through this interaction. %$* 475
now, some people say, well, europe was open to all sorts of new ideas, but in fact europe was open—was open to its own new ideas. %$* 475
there’s not a single major idea in european history that actually came from anywhere except europe. %$* 475
because europe has been a kind of closed—or euro-american society—been fairly closed to the conceptual life, the spiritual life, so forth of other parts of the world. %$* 475
islam is remarkably open. %$* 475
and, so i think it’s a question of, if you say that all that counts, is who gets rich, and who wins wars, and who’s able to set up an imperialist system, then you have one argument. %$* 475
but if you’re talking about the notion of stagnation, islam certainly did not stagnate in that period. %$* 475
this was a period of enormous growth and development of complexity and intercommunal cross-fertilization. %$* 475

i’m now going to ask, um, robert rosenkranz, the chairman of the rosenkranz foundation which is the sponsor of intelligence squared here in the united states, who’s going to frame tonight’s debate. %$* 106
bob. %$* 106
thank you, edward, and, uh, welcome, dana wolfe and i, uh, are very pleased to, uh, to extend a warm welcome to this evening’s debate, “russia is becoming our enemy again.” now this is not a debate about russia’s domestic arrangements, and whether we approve of them. %$* 1
uh, clearly, president putin has presided over a massive transfer of wealth and influence to a new russian elite of former kgb operatives. %$* 1
he’s an autocrat who wants to keep his power. %$* 1
russia is pursuing a far more assertive foreign policy, disrupting oil supply when displeased by its neighbors, threatening a new arms race, attacking the us as, quote, “the main violator of freedoms and human rights.” on the back of $90 oil, the russian economy is growing rapidly. %$* 1
the bear is well-fed and snarling. %$* 1
and by all accounts, the russian public heartily approves. %$* 1
the question tonight though is whether a new cold war is emerging. %$* 1
the most troublesome evidence is russia’s belligerence, even when its interests and ours seem to be aligned. %$* 1
it’s hard to imagine that russia wants a nuclear iran, or a radical islamic insurgency. %$* 1
so what do they hope to gain by undermining us pressure on iran? %$* 1
it’s also, uh, hard to see the advantage of discouraging foreign capital, technology and management skill. %$* 1
or how it serves russian interests to be perceived as an unreliable long-term supplier of energy. %$* 1
on the other hand, it’s easy to understand why russia might be smarting from a loss of empire, and international respect. %$* 1
why it might be wary about an american missile defense shield placed in its own back yard. %$* 1
it’s easy to see why the former oligarchs were viewed as having gained their wealth illegitimately. %$* 1
and it’s understandable why russia favors economic sanctions to exert pressures in its neighborhood, particularly when sanctions are favored policy tool of ours. %$* 1
so it’s easy to see how putin’s new assertiveness enhances his domestic popularity and power. %$* 1
is russia becoming our enemy again, or is it reacting in an understandable way to domestic political considerations, or perhaps to our own mistakes. %$* 1
well, we have an outstanding panel to help us decide, and a very able moderator in edward lucas—a veteran observer of the collapse of the soviet union, a long-time moscow bureau chief for the economist, fluent in five regional languages, and the auth—author of the forthcoming book, the new cold war, so maybe he’s not, uh, quite so neutral as he appears. %$* 1
edward, the evening is yours. %$* 1
well, thanks very much indeed, bob, for your, um, gracious introduction. %$* 106
now for those of you who haven’t been at one of these de—de—debates before let me just give you a brief rundown of the, um, of—of the evening. %$* 106
um, the members of the teams on both sides are going to give brief eight-minute introductions to their arguments, an eight minutes which will be ruthlessly enforced from the chair. %$* 106
and when those are complete i’m going to have a bit of discussion among the panel, and then open up to questions and points from the audience, and at the end of that we will have two-minute summations from each member of the panel, and then a vote. %$* 106
and you’ll vote with these keypads, and you’re gonna get a chance to practice, ‘cause we’re gonna have a vote at the beginning, and a vote at the end. %$* 106
because as someone who works at the economist i know that statistics are much better if you can measure them over time. %$* 106
and this will show how opinion has shifted in the course of the debate. %$* 106
so we’re gonna—in the course of the debate. %$* 106
so we’re gonna start off with the pre-debate vote, which shows your opinions as they were before you heard the arguments. %$* 106
so please pick up the keypad which in almost all cases will be on the armrest on your left. %$* 106
but, if you’re on the right-hand %$* 106
aisle, you’ll have to pick up—you don’t have a left, you have—there’ll be two keypads on your armrest and you’ll pick up one of them. %$* 106
and so tonight’s resolution is “russia is becoming our enemy again.” and when i tell you to, i’d like you to press 1, if you’re for the motion, 2 if you’re against, 3 if you’re undecided, and on no account press buttons 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, “go o.j.” or “question mark,” because then something—something bad will happen. %$* 106
so you may begin voting now, you don’t need to talk while you’re voting, we just—it’ll just take a couple of seconds, so please, 1 for “for,” 2 for “against,” and 3 for “undecided,” the panel is not allowed to vote, and i’m not going to. %$* 106
so, let’s see. %$* 106
now, if you’ve all voted, you won’t see the result now, uh, but you will see it in the course of the evening, and it’ll be very interesting. %$* 106
and i’m now going to introduce—introduce the panel, although you may have very strong personal views for or against, please refrain from either giving applause or even unmannerly boos, until all six have been introduced. %$* 106
so for the motion, uh, claudia rosett, staff journalist-in-residence at the foundation for defense of democracies; bret stephens, foreign affairs columnist and member of the editorial board of the wall street journal, and j.michael waller who’s the annenberg chair in international communication at the institute for world politics, and also vice president for information operations at the center for security policy. %$* 106
don’t clap. %$* 106
against the motion, the senior fellow of the world policy institute and professor of international affairs at the new school here in new york, nina—nina khrushcheva; robert legvold, who’s the marshall d.schulman professor of political science at columbia university; and finally mark medish, who’s the vice president for studies of russia, china and eurasia at the carnegie endowment for international peace. %$* 106
welcome. %$* 106
so, claudia rosett, you have eight minutes, starting now. %$* 106
thank you and good evening, um %$* 503
for the radio audience i’ve just placed a teapot and a teacup on the lectern. %$* 503
it’s a pleasure to be here this evening, thank you to our host, the rosenkranz foundation, to npr.thank you also, to—thank all of you for coming and thank you to the opposing team, for what i know will be a well-articulated argument for something we all wish were true. %$* 503
unfortunately it is not. %$* 503
i am here to argue for the motion that russia is becoming our enemy again. %$* 503
i’d like to begin with a few definitions. %$* 503
russia is an enormous polity encompassing more than 140 million people, 11 time zones and a multitude of views. %$* 503
i’m sure that many people in this room are personally acquainted with russians who are by no means our enemies. %$* 503
uh, but inside russia, their views count for less and less. %$* 503
and in speaking of russia, we must speak increas—of the increasingly authoritarian state— in speaking of russia in this debate tonight, the increasingly authoritarian russian state of president putin, of the security apparatus, and the chief and increasingly centralized and authoritarian centers of power. %$* 503
um, another definition i’d like to just get into quickly that’s important is “enemy.” the american heritage dictionary, which seems appropriate tonight, defines “enemy” as, quote, “one who manifests malice or hostility toward or opposes the purposes or interests—interests of another. %$* 503
a foe; an opponent.” finally, no one is here tonight that ru—to argue that russia is right now our enemy. %$* 503
the motion up for debate is that russia is becoming our enemy again. %$* 503
it is that direction, that becoming, that trajectory, which we are here to debate. %$* 503
for two benchmarks, i would like to share with a memory of a dinner in moscow more than a decade ago. %$* 503
it was with someone who has experienced, then and since, firsthand, russia’s trajectory not at a distance but has been living it. %$* 503
uh, he was then optimistic, it was a dinner with a number of journalists and despite our worries, he assured us that all would be well, that russia was heading in a good direction, that russians could get rich doing honest business. %$* 503
his name was garry kasparov. %$* 503
today, mr. %$* 503
kasparov has been pouring forth articles and giving interviews in the west warning us that russia is becoming, indeed has become, a criminal petro- state. %$* 503
the model he tells us is not the old czarist autocracy, but the godfather, the mafia. %$* 503
he wants to run in the presidential election next march, but what he recently told msnbc is that we’re not—quote, “we’re not fighting to win elections, we’re fighting to have elections.” okay, that may be bad for russia, but does it mean that russia’s government is becoming america’s enemy. %$* 503
yes. %$* 503
we live in an age when governments tend to export their creeds, methods, and technologies—uh, and techniques, excuse me. %$* 503
and, um, i’d like to just invite you for a minute to imagine, engage in a little imaginary experiment, that you are a russian democrat, a patriot, trying to warn the free world that russia is becoming an increasingly dangerous police state. %$* 503
let’s say you’re investigating the murder of a journalist and you meet in a city, say london, with an emissary of the kremlin. %$* 503
you have every right to the question you wish to ask, tea is served. %$* 503
would you without a second thought these days, drink that tea? %$* 503
this is a picture of alexander litvinenko who drank it, he’s here on this deathbed, these are the effects of polonium 210 on the human body. %$* 503
this—the kremlin denies anything to do with it. %$* 503
uh, this is a picture of viktor yushchenko, during his successful bid for the presidency of the ukraine, over the kremlin’s objections, these are the effects of dioxin on the human face. %$* 503
the kremlin denies anything to do with it. %$* 503
uh, to get to the bottom of such stories, can we turn to the russian media. %$* 503
no, not likely. %$* 503
they’ve been murdered, harassed, taken over, again the trajectory in the early ‘90s, when that optimistic dinner with garry kasparov took place, russia had a lively press, you could quarrel with what they wrote, but they could say what they wanted to, the shutdowns and takeovers since then, and i include a very partial list— ntv, the independent tv station, ort, all sort of coopted by government forces. %$* 503
the newsweekly itogi savonia tv-6, kommersant, the list goes on. %$* 503
the broad narrative over this time is that there have been phases and steps forward and back, to this direction that the russian government is taking. %$* 503
but, the broad arc, is that in the early 1990s, everything was up for grabs, the rules, the property, the whole thing, it was being sorted out. %$* 503
at this point, the shake-out has largely taken place. %$* 503
what do we see. %$* 503
the government has effectively reabsorbed the revenues coming from such oil and gas giants as yukos and gazprom. %$* 503
uh, we’ve seen them murdering of journalists, we’ve see the targeting of businessman mikhail khodorkovsky, who wanted to engage on western terms with western business. %$* 503
we’ve seen the increasing control over the regions, we’ve seen the rising charade of elections with president putin now suggesting he might want to stay on as prime minister. %$* 503
again the rise of the authoritarian state. %$* 503
again, does this make russia our enemy. %$* 503
yes, that’s—and the reason why is, governments such as this need enemies to justify what they do, to deflect anger and frustrations, to show that they are important and necessary. %$* 503
and in russia’s—the russ—russia in the sense of those who now rule— in russia’s quest to do that the real rival is the us.and, following, sort of the initial and conditional cooperation we saw in a sort of sunny phase just after september 11th— even that was problematic—russia’s government has become increasingly hostile and confrontational. %$* 503
if i run out of time my colleagues are going to cover more for you, but, let’s give a few examples. %$* 503
uh, putin’s polarizing speech in february in munich accusing the us of, quote, singling out the us, of forcing its will on the world, and accusing the us of undermining international security. %$* 503
quote, “one state, the united states, has oversepped a— stepped its national borders in every way,” he said. %$* 503
you can find a great many more examples of states, you can argue about us policy but, he was directing this at the us for the world to hear. %$* 503
um, according to a recent statement by the us director of national intelligence, russia now spies on the us nearly as much as during the cold war. %$* 503
uh, the difficulties raised for neighbor— nearby states, uh, which are inclined to be friendliest to the us, including %$* 503
lobbing a missile into georgia, fiddling with gas supplies to the ukraine, waging cyberwar on estonia, and, finally, iran, where russia has spent more than a decade over us protests transferring nuclear technology. %$* 503
uh, and at the un in security council efforts to do something about this has been, one of the prime obstacles, watering down resolutions, objecting, signing only when— %$* 503
—it may, may—it couldn’t really do much more. %$* 503
oil prices. %$* 503
russia has every interest in keeping those high, roiling the middle east, making trouble that is %$* 503
in—inimical to us interests. %$* 503
six years ago president bush looked into president putin’s eyes and thought he saw a friend of the united states of america. %$* 503
if only. %$* 503
what we have been learning since then as russia charts its course, its direction of becoming, is that in america’s dealings with the kremlin, it is wiser as with any antagonist, foe, opponent, enemy in the making, to watch your back. %$* 503
thank you very much. %$* 503
one minute. %$* 106
—it may, may—it couldn’t really do much more. %$* 503
oil prices. %$* 503
russia has every interest in keeping those high, roiling the middle east, making trouble that is %$* 503
in—inimical to us interests. %$* 503
six years ago president bush looked into president putin’s eyes and thought he saw a friend of the united states of america. %$* 503
if only. %$* 503
what we have been learning since then as russia charts its course, its direction of becoming, is that in america’s dealings with the kremlin, it is wiser as with any antagonist, foe, opponent, enemy in the making, to watch your back. %$* 503
thank you very much. %$* 503
thank you very much indeed, um, claudia rosett, for the benefit of the radio audience i should say the teapot was blue. %$* 106
robert legvold. %$* 106
it’s a pleasure to be with you and a pleasure to be a part of this event. %$* 504
i think everybody in this hall would agree that russia today is not a us ally, not even a disaffected ally as so many of our traditional friends are. %$* 504
but then to claim that russia is, or soon will be an enemy, seems to us to be both wrong, and unhelpful, almost certainly even harmful. %$* 504
it’s wrong because it misunderstands what russia’s all about, and it misunderstands what motivates its foreign policy. %$* 504
and it’s unhelpful, maybe even harmful as i’ve said, because it almost certainly runs the risk of bringing about the behavior and the stance on russia’s part that we fear in the first place, and not the least, not the least, by %$* 504
driving home or reinforcing the extraordinary excessive suspicion of the us that radiates across not merely the political leadership but the political spectrum in russia, and the enormously warped misinterpretation of us, uh, foreign policy and what we are all about. %$* 504
there’s no question, that putin’s russia, putin himself has put russia, in the forefront of the most vocal critics of us foreign policy, there’s no question that anti- americanism within russia, is more intense and more widespread not only than it has been at any point in the 15 years of russian independence but well back into the soviet period. %$* 504
there’s no question, that the russian leadership and much of the political elite sees %$* 504
nato initiatives and us foreign policy initiatives as a threat to their national security, and indicate that they mean to offset them. %$* 504
there’s no question that what russia’s doing on a number of issues of concern to us are contrary, is contrary to our preferences. %$* 504
uh, and there is no question as claudia has well-demonstrated, that under putin russia has veered from the democratic path. %$* 504
that makes russia a challenge. %$* 504
that doesn’t make russia an enemy. %$* 504
what is russia about. %$* 504
i think three things. %$* 504
first of all a renewed voice. %$* 504
russia once again wants a place at the table with the major powers. %$* 504
secondly, russia wants respect for its national interests as it defines them, not the way in which we define them. %$* 504
secondly—or third, russia wants an end to the assigned role as either a pupil or as a junior partner. %$* 504
as one of the russians wrote not so long ago, “the pedagogical relationship is over,” and russia wants an independent role in international politics, even a leadership role. %$* 504
and we’re seeing it increasingly in the way in which they exert themselves as a mediator on major issues, among and between major powers. %$* 504
and third, or second, what it wants beyond voice, is an enhanced power and influence within the post-soviet space. %$* 504
and this in two ways particularly, first of all, as a lead role in managing security within that sphere, that’s very different from acquiring real estate, and secondly aggrandizing itself economically within the post-soviet space, and aggrandizing itself economically is very important to putin at this point. %$* 504
none of this you’ll notice, suggests that russia is easy or not a problem for us, i said challenge. %$* 504
doesn’t make it an enemy, and third it wants %$* 504
it wants influence over the design of an evolving international order. %$* 504
the first step from that is to blunt what they see as excesses in us foreign policy. %$* 504
that’s a problem for us. %$* 504
they’re not the only country in the world that wants to blunt the excesses in us foreign policy. %$* 504
but they then go on to talk about collective major-power responsibility in international politics, and they want to extend the circle. %$* 504
they mean to bring in china and india and probably beyond that. %$* 504
so wherein then is the problem? %$* 504
what makes russia a challenge and not an enemy. %$* 504
i think it is the ambiguity and the shapelessness at the very base of russian foreign policy today. %$* 504
because, the heart of russia’s international posture today, is a unity of opposites. %$* 504
russia claims it has no enemy, it has no ally. %$* 504
everyone—no one is an enemy, no one is an ally, everyone is a partner, everyone is a competitor. %$* 504
and that leads to a behavior, which is troublesome not only for us but i think for the future of russia in its foreign policy, a policy of trying to have its cake and eat it as well. %$* 504
and this and fur— furthermore is compounded by the absence of strategic vision, within putin’s russia, and on his part as leader. %$* 504
uh, russia foreign policy’s driven by impulses and di—and, and desires, but impulses are not a strategy. %$* 504
and even less are they a strategic vision. %$* 504
and without strategic vision russia is not in a position to make durable, long-term strategic choices. %$* 504
so then, what should be our response in these circumstances. %$* 504
first of all, what not to do. %$* 504
what not to do is premature containment, and jumping to that conclusion. %$* 504
not empty hectoring, not drawing red lines. %$* 504
not even tough love, particularly when we have so little direct leverage in order to pursue that kind of a policy. %$* 504
and what to do? %$* 504
a policy that would be deft, that would be coherent, that would be frank, and that would be firm, and that would follow, in my view, three guidelines. %$* 504
first of all to try to engage in a constructive and an effective dialogue with russia over all issues including the most fundamental ones that concern claudia and her colleagues as, uh, even— uh, uh, that concerns us as much as it concerns claudia and her colleagues, that is, the basic values question and where things are going within russia. %$* 504
but not posturing. %$* 504
and in order to get to a dialogue with russia we have a fundamental initial problem. %$* 504
that is to persuade not merely putin and people around him but a vaude part of the political spectrum, that our stake in this is not an ulterior motive, that it’s genuine, and that it is direct. %$* 504
secondly, i think that %$* 504
uh, we want to as much as possible focus on the overlap in our core interests, and they’re very considerable, while mitigating the increasingly tension-field tension-filled differences over tactics. %$* 504
the core interests are, the struggle against global terrorism. %$* 504
islamic extremism. %$* 504
the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. %$* 504
and the issue that we forget about these days, that is regulating, producing stability among the nuclear haves, not merely dealing with the nuclear have-nots. %$* 504
this is now a multipolar nuclear world. %$* 504
and we need to manage it in a way that we’ve neglected for any number of years, and finally, in a still more positive note, to, uh, promote the progressive and dynamic development of the post-soviet economies, not just russia. %$* 504
the entire region, those are our common core interests, but we really do disagree often on how we go about a number of these cases, take the one that’s very much in the forefront of our mind these days, iran. %$* 504
i would not for a moment— %$* 504
—deny that russia and putin and people around him, special interests around him have very self-regarding, selfish interests when it comes to developing their relationship with iran. %$* 504
but at heart the problem is a different one. %$* 504
we agree, both russia and the united states that we do not want a nuclear iran. %$* 504
but, at the tactical level we disagree about first of all, what kind of a time- frame we’re operating in, how much time we have or not. %$* 504
and then secondly how we put carrots and sticks together. %$* 504
and the degree to which we privilege the sticks and privilege them early, that’s the kind of thing that we need to do if the core interest coordinate—if the core interest, is as i’ve said, to deny a nuclear iran. %$* 504
the %$* 504
the third guideline would be that we coordinate our assessment and our approach to russia among the major countries of the west, europe and japan, while at the same time in our policy toward china and india, that we deny russia the opportunity of using china and indian against us— %$* 504
thank you. %$* 504
i’m finished. %$* 504
one minute— %$* 106
—deny that russia and putin and people around him, special interests around him have very self-regarding, selfish interests when it comes to developing their relationship with iran. %$* 504
but at heart the problem is a different one. %$* 504
we agree, both russia and the united states that we do not want a nuclear iran. %$* 504
but, at the tactical level we disagree about first of all, what kind of a time- frame we’re operating in, how much time we have or not. %$* 504
and then secondly how we put carrots and sticks together. %$* 504
and the degree to which we privilege the sticks and privilege them early, that’s the kind of thing that we need to do if the core interest coordinate—if the core interest, is as i’ve said, to deny a nuclear iran. %$* 504
the %$* 504
the third guideline would be that we coordinate our assessment and our approach to russia among the major countries of the west, europe and japan, while at the same time in our policy toward china and india, that we deny russia the opportunity of using china and indian against us— %$* 504
robert legvold, your time is up, i’m afraid. %$* 106
thank you. %$* 504
i’m finished. %$* 504
now just before bret stephens, um, continues the debate for the motion, um, if the remarks you’ve heard so far have already got you wanting to make points of your own the index cards are here held by the ushers, do attract their attention, get them to start jotting down questions you’d like to make to—or you’d like to ask and points you’d like to make, and they will then be passed to me and i will call you in due course, if i can. %$* 106
bret stephens for the motion. %$* 106
well, like, uh, claudia i wanna preface my comments by reminding, uh, all of you of what it is we are debating here. %$* 141
uh, claudia, michael and i are not on this stage to argue that russia is an enemy of the united states. %$* 141
and you as the audience are not here to vote on whether or not that proposition is true. %$* 141
rather, we are here to make the case that russia is becoming an enemy. %$* 141
so what’s at issue here, is the trend, the direction, the question of where all—all this is going. %$* 141
so let me devote my time to looking at in a very factual way, how events have unfolded in just the past year. %$* 141
let me remind you that we are on the eve of the anniversary of the poisoning of, um, alexander litvinenko. %$* 141
let me remind you also that alexander litvinenko was a british subject. %$* 141
he was murdered by a lethal dose of pol—of polonium 210, which was a de facto case of nuclear homicide if not nuclear terrorism. %$* 141
from his deathbed, litvinenko personally accused vladimir putin of ordering the sa—the assassination. %$* 141
since then, scotland yard has pinned, uh, the murder on a russian businessman, an ex- or if you will current fsb man, named andre—andrei lugovoi. %$* 141
in july, the british foreign secretary david miliband, noted that, quote, “the russian government has failed to register either how seriously we treat this case, or the seriousness of the issues involved.” the russian foreign ministry responded with a brush-off, that they could not understand why british would hazard its relationship with russia, quote, “for the sake of one man.” for the sake of one man, let me remind you that, liberal democracy is constructed for the sake of one man. %$* 141
in a month’s time, mr. %$* 141
lugovoi, litvinenko’s killer, is likely to be elected a member of the russian parliament. %$* 141
in december of 2006, the kremlin pulled out— pulled the rug out from the largest foreign, uh, investment to date in russia, which was, uh, shell’s 20—$20 billion oil and gas project on sakhalin island, using transparently phony regulatory excuses. %$* 141
it happened again in june to british petroleum. %$* 141
the assault on foreign investment in russia, was the natural extension of the illegal seizure of russia’s privately held energy assets, particularly those of yukos and its seek— and its ceo, mikhail khodorkovsky, whose prison term in a siberian, uh, labor camp, has recently been extended. %$* 141
in january, mr. %$* 141
putin forced the belarusian government to sign a new gas contract, or else have its gas supplies turned off in the dead of winter. %$* 141
now belarus is not a friend of the united states, but ukraine and georgia are friends of the united states. %$* 141
and in both cases mr. %$* 141
putin had previously used what i would call pipeline warfare to threaten his neighbors, to threaten and bully his neighbors at their coldest and most vulnerable moments. %$* 141
nex—in the next month, in february, a man named ivan safronov, a reporter for the, uh, for the kommersant newspaper, was—or i should say fell from a fourth-story window onto the street, where he died instantly. %$* 141
the authorities ruled it a suicide, but most observers believe that safronov, who had repeatedly embarrassed the russian military with his reporting, was executed, making him the 14th such journalist killed, murdered, during mr. %$* 141
putin’s reign. %$* 141
the same month, a russian court condemned nine members of the ethnic minorities’ rights group froda, for having a quote-unquote, “unsanctioned tea” with two german students. %$* 141
quote, “we were told that under the new law on ngo’s, any meeting of two or more people, with the purpose of discussing publicly important issues, has to be sanctioned by the local administration three days in advance,” froda’s director told london’s daily telegraph. %$* 141
the next month, in march, an american russia analyst named pol—named paul joyal, was shot outside his home in suburban maryland, shortly after meeting a former kgb general. %$* 141
four days before that shooting, on “dateline nbc,” mr. %$* 141
jo—joyal had noted that, quote, “a message has been communicated to anyone who wants to speak out against the kremlin. %$* 141
if you do, no matter where you are, we will find you and we will silence you in the most horrible way possible,” end of quote. %$* 141
the next month, in april, mr. %$* 141
putin indicated that he intended to withdraw russia from the conventional forces in europe treaty, one of the landmark agreements ending the cold war. %$* 141
he has since indicated, that he is prepared to withdraw russia from the 1987 intermediate nuclear forces treaty, signed by reagan and gorbachov. %$* 141
the next month, in may, um, ethnic russians rioted in the city of tallinn, when the estonian government decided to remove a world war ii monument to their soviet liberators. %$* 141
estonia was subject to a conv—uh, to a concerted cyber-attack, and its ambassador in moscow was attacked by youth protesters almost certainly belonging to a neo-fascist group known as nashi, i should remind you that estonia is a member of nato and the european union. %$* 141
in june, mr. %$* 141
putin warned that if the us deployed just 10 ballistic missile interceptors in poland, then russia will, quote, “have to get new targets in europe. %$* 141
which weapons will be used,” he said, “ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, or some completely new systems, that’s a technical matter.” in july, mr. %$* 141
putin took a vacation. %$* 141
in august %$* 141
um, in august, russia detained a mainstream business journalist for the vedomosti paper, a paper that is, uh, uh, partly owned by, by dow jones, on suspicious of so-called extremist activity, via a law that defines the term “extremist” so broadly that it can be used to target ordinary political critics of the kremlin. %$* 141
russia also resumed, and this is notable, a policy of sending its heavy bombers out on lower—long-range sorties, on more than several occasions, norwegian, british, and finally american fighters have been forced to scramble into the air, in order to intercept these russian bombers, the first time this has happened since the cold war. %$* 141
in september, mr. %$* 141
putin appointed an unknown apparatchik, mr. %$* 141
vic—viktor zubkov, as prime minister, and later announced that he himself may become, uh, may—may—may become prime minister, um, in the next government, which is contrary to every prior promise he has made, that he would leave the political scene when his presidential term expires. %$* 141
this sets the scene for the youthful mr. %$* 141
putin to remain in power for a very long time indeed. %$* 141
in october mr. %$* 141
putin became the first russian leader to visit tehran since josef stalin in 1943.he said iran’s purposes are entirely peaceful, russia has stopped, um, cooperating with the rest of the security council on the un, forcing the us to resort to the uni—to—to unilateral sanctions. %$* 141
and finally i would like to make one point. %$* 141
just last week george w.bush insisted in a speech, that russia is not an enemy of the united states. %$* 141
now if that does not convince this audience that our side is right, i don’t know what will. %$* 141
thank you very much. %$* 141
one minute. %$* 106

now if that does not convince this audience that our side is right, i don’t know what will. %$* 141
thank you very much. %$* 141
thanks very much and if you’ve filled in some cards with questions now’s a good time to pass them to the end of the row, where the ushers will, um, will collect them. %$* 106
nina khrushcheva, against the motion. %$* 106
thank you very much, thank you rosenkranz foundation, thank you the opposers of the motion, and thank you those who vote for it and thank you, edward lucas. %$* 505
uh, there are at least three reasons as to why russia is not becoming an enemy, or at least shouldn’t become one. %$* 505
one. %$* 505
today the world is no longer bipolar, in fact it’s not even multipolar, even—um, unipolar, even if some in the united states may still think it is. %$* 505
that is america is no longer in a position to decide who to make or not to make an enemy, even though it certainly continues to be listened to in this regard. %$* 505
but there are many more actors in play today, china, middle east, europe, whose international interests have to be considered. %$* 505
there is no cold war ideological divide in which one ideology wants to take over the other, and dominate the world. %$* 505
thus at present, there are no geopolitical conditions for the cold war. %$* 505
two. %$* 505
despite the 11 time-zones, russia is not a soviet empire, to fight against. %$* 505
it’s not an empire at all. %$* 505
although true, under vladimir putin, it appears russia still has its imperial ambitions as, uh, the, uh, those who supported the motion very ably demonstrated. %$* 505
however the country today doesn’t have its former capabilities. %$* 505
it could with varying successes create an illusion of those capabilities such as testing weapons, or, um %$* 505
reinstating military exercises, which actually have been very much prone to accidents. %$* 505
although at times putin tries to flex his imperial muscles, old—at—old habits die hard, obviously. %$* 505
such as during the 2004 presidential ukrainian elections, he’s more interested in being recognized as, uh, an international player than really building an empire. %$* 505
but if he feels, in order to be recognized as player he needs to play an empire, he would, and he does. %$* 505
three. %$* 505
the united states grumble about putin’s international policy, but loudly talks about his internal policy. %$* 505
but actually disagreements on how to run a state is not enough to make an enemy. %$* 505
just look at saudi arabia. %$* 505
while in foreign policy, the discussion actually does take place. %$* 505
here i would like to quote quite commonsensical condoleeza rice during the talks on the us missile defense plan in eastern europe. %$* 505
and i quote. %$* 505
“even though we have our differences, we have a great deal in common, because that which unites us in trying to deal with threats of terrorism, of proliferation, is much greater than the issues that divide us.” she said it in moscow on october 12th this year. %$* 505
moreover, even dick cheney, who came out of the dr. %$* 505
strangelove cold war generation, and thus sees enemies everywhere, in 2006 vilnius presentation, despite his tough talk on putin’s backtracking on democracy said, and i quote, “none of us believes that russia is fated to become an enemy,” so it’s not just george bush. %$* 505
there are smarter people who said that. %$* 505
um, let me develop on all three points. %$* 505
to one, on ideological—on no ideological divide. %$* 505
in fact, putin would argue that both russia and the united states today are of the same ideology, that is democracy, and of the same economic system, which is capitalism. %$* 505
in essence, he feels they disagree on tactics, methodology, and implementation. %$* 505
the unifying context of his presidency is that russia will be great and strong if it continues to be a multi-party democracy. %$* 505
but, despite the wishes of the west, it can’t exist without a strong leader. %$* 505
president, prime minister, or wherever he chooses to continue to be. %$* 505
in russia, the economy is free, he says, but the state must control its wealth. %$* 505
therefore, putin so bristles at suggestions that he’s backtracking on democracy. %$* 505
at the valde discussion club, uh, meeting in solche this september, putin criticized the united states’ criticism as a ploy. %$* 505
and i quote. %$* 505
“we see efforts to exploit the phraseology of democracy to influence over internal politics. %$* 505
this is dangerous. %$* 505
it undermines faith in the basic principles of democracy, if you need something from us you need to talk about the substance, not to approach it from another angle. %$* 505
you need to re—you need to resolve kosovo, talk about kosovo. %$* 505
you need to resolve the, uh, nuclear issue from iran, talk about iran. %$* 505
not about democracy in russia.” to number two. %$* 505
on threatening so far imperial—russia imperial ambition. %$* 505
putin’s message that russia is a great powerful and divinely ordained state, that stretches back 1000 years, and the fact that he’s there to restore its glory and its proper place in the world, is very much embraced by the russians, as mr. %$* 505
rosenkranz indicated. %$* 505
at times, it may sound like boastful animosity. %$* 505
but this tough imperial-sounding stunt is only a logical consequences—consequence of the brutal disappointment of the russians with the course of events since the collapse of communism. %$* 505
poverty, politic wars, crony privatization, the 1998 financial crisis, along with the humiliations, perceived and real, uh, inflicted the west, from the nato expansion to endless preaching. %$* 505
as russians see it, it is putin’s no-nonsense rhetoric, and his firm actions both at home and abroad, that allowed— allows him, in just a dozen years, to lead the country from bankruptcy and despair to wealth and power. %$* 505
which in russia historically are thought of in imperial terms. %$* 505
to number three. %$* 505
to common interests. %$* 505
putin is prepared to cooperate with the state. %$* 505
even if he promptly switches to confrontation when he senses a snub, like that cheney talk in vil— vilnius. %$* 505
however, the russian president’s and the us president’s %$* 505
bickering is not about the future cold war i think, but rather means the following, and these are my words, not theirs. %$* 505
we’re annoyed at each other, for either country putting itself first. %$* 505
obviously, none lost superpower ambitions. %$* 505
for not being what the other wants it to be. %$* 505
but this is rather a political game, than a war, in a—an enemy public holder, while we deal with much more pressing issues that really preoccupy us, terrorism, nuclear threats, energy, security, and many, many more. %$* 505
in conclusion, us- russian relations today certainly display annoyance, and some genetic cold war-rooted suspicions. %$* 505
so the language of the cold war creeps in, and is read as animosity. %$* 505
but there is a serious recognition that there is plenty of common interest in the oil and energy strategy talks with iran and north korea and many others. %$* 505
let’s face it. %$* 505
we all need a good enemy. %$* 505
and while bin laden is at large, and terrorism is still amorphous, and the fight with it is not going too well, russia and the united states need their cold war dance moves to pass time before they figure out what their relationship really is, or should be, when next year, the next administration, at least in america, comes in. %$* 505
thank you. %$* 505
one minute— %$* 106

thank you. %$* 505
thank you very much, nina khrushcheva. %$* 106
do keep passing your questions on those little cards to the end of the aisle. %$* 106
and now for the motion, michael waller. %$* 106
thank you, edward. %$* 506
it’s great to be here up in manhattan, i don’t get up here a lot but if—if i have to go back to washington knowing that you folks ratified dick cheney’s views on russia, uh, i don’t know what i’m gonna be doing for the next week but certainly edward will have to change the lead of his article, uh, for next week. %$* 506
first, us presidents since george bush the elder, president clinton, this current president bush have bent over backwards, to make sure that russia doesn’t become our enemy. %$* 506
we’ve done practically everything possible from subsidizing their economy to looking the other way at a lot of their transgressions to make sure that, that, uh, that we don’t offend russia, we don’t try to over %$* 506
make them overreact. %$* 506
we don’t criticize them too harshly and so forth. %$* 506
and, uh %$* 506
but while we were doing that we chose to look the other way, when certain elements of the old soviet regime, uh, regained power, consolidated power with gangster interests that took advantage of the economic reforms, and seized control in the form of vladimir putin. %$* 506
and that is the former secret police, uh, the chekists, the kgb, who have managed to take control of a formerly— of a former democratic experiment, and turn it into a dictatorship. %$* 506
and any secret police system in the world needs to have a foreign enemy in order to justify its own political grip on power. %$* 506
so, given that, it’s the will of the putin regime itself to have the united states as an enemy, and to become an enemy of the united states in order to perpetuate itself in power. %$* 506
this was revealed in kommersant daily in, in early 2000, after putin became president, when putin’s chief of staff and the state security chief petrushev, got together and they decided the democratic institutions should not be nurtured. %$* 506
in fact they should be, uh, there should be a return to, to rule by force in russia. %$* 506
and they recommended exceeding the constitutional limitations on the power of the presidency, to create this dictatorship. %$* 506
and to create the nec—necessary conditions not just in russia, but in the near abroad, which is the old sovietspeak for the, for the former soviet empire. %$* 506
so there was a clandestine manipulation and, and oppression of political parties, of politicians. %$* 506
we saw the faces of, of, of one of the ukrainian politicians who, who happened to run afoul of them. %$* 506
another one of those politicians, galina starovoitova was on our editorial board, she was murdered before, before this document happened but another one of our members of our editorial board, yuri shekoshekin uh, editor, very brave editor was, was poisoned to death, uh %$* 506
as a—as a staunch critic of the kgb- ization of the new russian government. %$* 506
this document, uh, was designed to promote putin as the president, and to, and to wage, quote, “preventive political action.” throughout russia, and to plant kgb personnel, throughout the presidency, throughout the government ministries, in control of the armed forces as it never had been before, and in control of governorships, and administrative regions across the country. %$* 506
at the same time there was no accountability or national reconciliation so if you look at, at south africa after apartheid they had truth commissions to uncover the crimes of the past, or chile, or argentina, or el salvador, or poland, or east germany, or the czech republic. %$* 506
or so many other countries that had been under a tyrannical government, had tried to come clean and expose the secrets of the past and the—and the—and those who were responsible for committing those crimes against humanity. %$* 506
that was never the casein russia. %$* 506
where there was a de- stasification campaign in east germany against the stasi, there was nothing of the sort in russia. %$* 506
so no one has brought—been brought to trial, no one has been, been exposed or held accountable for any of the crimes of the past. %$* 506
and as a result of that lack of accountability, and lack of national introspection, it’s become normal among most russians to be treated as they had been. %$* 506
and so there is no coming to terms with the past, no break %$* 506
no de-nazification, imagine having a, a free west germany without de-nazification. %$* 506
and allowing former gestapo to stay in their posts, and even become president of the country, it—it’s the moral equivalent there. %$* 506
so, all—over time they’ve whittled away at human rights, they’ve whittled away with—at a free press and everything else. %$* 506
at the same time, this summer, the russian government came out with an ideological guidelines for social studies and history for public schools in russia. %$* 506
and it’s a kremlin-imposed guideline. %$* 506
putin himself addressed the teachers and the academics at the book launch, he said, “we must not allow others to impose a feeling of guilt on us.” in the washington post coverage of, of this event, uh, they surveyed the sto—social studies guide, they said it’s, quote, “marked by intense hostility to the united states.” and the editor of the manual, leonid polyakov, said “we are developing a national ideology that represents the vision of ourselves as a nation, as russians, a vision of our own identity, and the world around us.” a paranoid, hostile, enemy-oriented identity. %$* 506
stalin in these books is shown, for the teachers’ guidelines in the russian public schools he’s shown as, quote, “the most succ—successful leader of the ussr.” and the guidelines on teaching about stalin’s crimes are so ambiguous, that they’re not even required in russian public schools. %$* 506
and the last chapter of the history guidebook %$* 506
lays out a new cult of personality of the new russian president. %$* 506
quote, “we see that practically every significant deed is connected with vladimir v.putin.” so this cult of personality is being built, they require some foreign adversary to, to justify the repressive measures they take. %$* 506
now the iconography of the old kgb has been preserved, imagine if, if after de-nazification in west germany, they’re—the old symbols were still preserved of the, of the, of the, of the nazi party. %$* 506
yet if you go to the russian police stations, they have the sword and shield, that’s the old bolshevik cheka secret police symbol. %$* 506
you go to the foreign intelligence services offices, they have the same symbol, you go to the fsb state security services, they have the same symbol. %$* 506
you go to the, to the state prosecutor, they have the same symbol. %$* 506
so that same conscious iconography of the past, where the sword was there in drz—felix dzerzhinsky’s words, to, “to protect the revolution even if it came down on the heads of the innocent.” this is the type of system that russia’s preserving. %$* 506
you have an out-of-control spy services where corruption, uh %$* 506
contract killings, bombings since putin has been, uh, suc— was first state security chief and then prime minister, and then president. %$* 506
the russian military intelligence, which feeds on paranoia, the same way it did in the soviet times, that—that organization has not been reformed at all. %$* 506
yet, that continues to feed on paranoia, uh, of the paranoia, in its intelligence reporting to the russia military and political leadership, that the west is still a great threat. %$* 506
organized crime is, is rampant in a country with a huge secret police system that could easily crush it if it wanted to. %$* 506
journalists who investigate organized crime have been murdered, especially those investigating the organized crime in st. %$* 506
petersburg, where putin used to handle hard-currency operations before he came to, to, uh, moscow. %$* 506
when he took power as president he stuffed the government with kgb people, to the defense minister, the first time in russian history that a secret policeman had been put in charge— %$* 506
—of the military. %$* 506
military reform has not occurred. %$* 506
in fact the military is modernizing, they have an intercontinental ballistic missile force, brand new, modern force, the topol-m.they don’t need it. %$* 506
we’re not their enemy, they don’t need it. %$* 506
right now as we’re speaking, the yuri dolgoruky which is a new borei class, uh, submarine, nuclear submarine, is undergoing its sea trials now, new ballistic missile submarine, more modern than anything we have, they don’t need it. %$* 506
they’re building—uh, an aircraft-carrier fleet is in their budget for the next few years as well, as a power-projection force. %$* 506
this is not a sign of a country that’s seeking to be an ally of the west, and every sign that intends %$* 506
that the intent is in the future to have the capability to be our enemy if the political climate so declares. %$* 506
thank you. %$* 506
one minute. %$* 106
—of the military. %$* 506
military reform has not occurred. %$* 506
in fact the military is modernizing, they have an intercontinental ballistic missile force, brand new, modern force, the topol-m.they don’t need it. %$* 506
we’re not their enemy, they don’t need it. %$* 506
right now as we’re speaking, the yuri dolgoruky which is a new borei class, uh, submarine, nuclear submarine, is undergoing its sea trials now, new ballistic missile submarine, more modern than anything we have, they don’t need it. %$* 506

this is not a sign of a country that’s seeking to be an ally of the west, and every sign that intends %$* 506
that the intent is in the future to have the capability to be our enemy if the political climate so declares. %$* 506
thank you. %$* 506
michael waller, thank you, and now against the motion, mark medish. %$* 106
ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for coming this evening, particularly if, uh, you’re voting against the motion. %$* 507
i urge you to reject the motion, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 507
to reject it %$* 507
is not at all to defend russia, or to defend mr. %$* 507
putin. %$* 507
it is to be clear about us interests, and about realistic us policy options. %$* 507
it’s to be realistic about the complexity of the world in which we have to conduct our foreign policy. %$* 507
indeed—indeed the motion is wrong for at least three main reasons in my view. %$* 507
first it gets russia wrong from the standpoint of us national security interests. %$* 507
whoever’s in the white house, whether a democrat or a republican, will have to advance those same us national security interests %$* 507
many of which we share with russia, that my colleagues have named, uh, and, and, these are absolutely vital to our national security. %$* 507
uh, for example, combating nuclear pro—uh, proliferation, uh, uh, counter— counteracting islamic extremism around the world. %$* 507
i’ll develop this a bit further. %$* 507
the second reason that the motion %$* 507
is wrong, is that it lacks historical perspective, and is incorrect on its face. %$* 507
russia is not the soviet union %$* 507
the motion conflates the two, russia could not be becoming our enemy again, this russia has never been our enemy. %$* 507
so the motion is simply wrong on its face. %$* 507
if we were in a courtroom, i would ask the judge for a directed verdict. %$* 507
and i urge you to consider one too. %$* 507
third, the motion is framed with a friend-versus-foe mentality, that is most likely %$* 507
to lead us down the wrong path. %$* 507
it misunderstands the world which is much more complicated. %$* 507
there’s a vast middle distance. %$* 507
all those who are not our friends are not necessarily our enemies, and are not necessarily becoming our enemies. %$* 507
it’s that difficult work in the middle distance, uh %$* 507
that russia, challenges us to do. %$* 507
russia’s becoming more difficult %$* 507
indeed, in many, many ways. %$* 507
but it’s not becoming our enemy, certainly not our enemy again. %$* 507
we are not their enemy, they are not ours. %$* 507
russia may be its own worst enemy. %$* 507
indeed i think it is in many, many respects. %$* 507
but that does not make it our enemy. %$* 507
again to go back to us national security interests, questions of this are not about metaphysics or metaphors. %$* 507
they’re about concrete security interests. %$* 507
where we find interests in common with other countries, we must work together with them as best we can. %$* 507
we may have disagreements, there may be friction, there may be deep disappointments and indeed there is great disillusionment and disenchantment in the mutual relationship today. %$* 507
on both sides. %$* 507
nevertheless that doesn’t change our core national security interests, in containing weapons of mass destruction, in limiting the proliferation of fissile materials, in strategic arms control, in stability through eurasia %$* 507
and in the middle east and in countering islamic extremism around the world. %$* 507
these are core issues, they have not changed recently for us, or for the russians. %$* 507
we need to do a better job working together, to address these interests. %$* 507
second, once again, the proposition simply cannot be correct on its face. %$* 507
russia has not been our enemy before. %$* 507
we are not talking here about the soviet union, or a return to the ussr. or a return to the gulag %$* 507
or to rule by the communist party. %$* 507
so there is no “again” at play here. %$* 507
and i urge you to take the words seriously, the words do matter, when we vote on a motion. %$* 507
we don’t have a new cold war coming. %$* 507
it may be a cool peace, but that’s a very important distinction. %$* 507
it’s disagreeable, it’s suboptimal, it’s difficult, but it’s not a war. %$* 507
it’s a heightened challenge. %$* 507
we go through this kind of debate in the united states periodically. %$* 507
who lost russia. %$* 507
right? %$* 507
the red threat, we did it in—during our last political cycle, we’re doing it again now. %$* 507
we ought to be careful about this, we need to separate the rhetoric from the reality and the rhetoric from what are the core us national security interests, that any president and any administration will have to serve. %$* 507
finally i wanna talk about the mind-set, the friend-foe problem. %$* 507
because it really represents a mentality that has gotten us into more trouble, uh, in recent times, and i think we need to steer clear of it. %$* 507
we need, we need to pay careful attention to distinctions and details %$* 507
in assessing the trend lines, lest, the friend-foe distinctions become a—a self- fulfilling prophecy. %$* 507
it simply need not be so. %$* 507
it need not be so. %$* 507
regrettably there are people in russia, who think the same way. %$* 507
if we were in moscow today, i’d be debating against them. %$* 507
reminding them that the us is not their enemy and is not becoming their enemy. %$* 507
but so too i remind you today, russia is not becoming our enemy. %$* 507
there’s a vast middle distance. %$* 507
lots of difficult complicated countries. %$* 507
china. %$* 507
pakistan. %$* 507
turkey. %$* 507
saudi arabia. %$* 507
all countries where we could have %$* 507
a long discussion, about the litany %$* 507
of problems, of sorrows, of mistakes, as we’ve just heard about russia. %$* 507
it doesn’t make them our enemy. %$* 507
it doesn’t mean that they’re becoming our enemy. %$* 507
they are counterparts, partners with whom we have to work. %$* 507
we have to work on a basis of shared interests where we can find them, and we have those with russia. %$* 507

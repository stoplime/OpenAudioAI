and i now want to bring to the stage the chairman of intelligence squared u.s.what we normally do before the debates, and we're going to do it now, is spend a couple of minutes framing this debate and why we picked it and what we're hoping for to come from the debate. %$* 13
so i'd like to bring to the stage now the gentleman who brought intelligence squared u.s.to new york city. %$* 13
let's please welcome robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
hi, john. %$* 1
hi, bob. %$* 13
so we do various kinds of motions. %$* 13
sometimes it's right out of the headlines. %$* 13
it's a policy choice. %$* 13
we've done "repeal obamacare" or "abolish the minimum wage." and then we do others that are a judgment on the state of things like "science refutes god." tonight we're doing one of our, "what if," kind of hypothetical debates. %$* 13
it's a different shape of an argument. %$* 13
tell us about what we're doing tonight. %$* 13
well, of course, as i'm sure you've said, this is not a debate about immigration. %$* 1
it really is an experiment and a debate about pushing free market ideas to the limit. %$* 1
and we actually did an experiment like that a couple of years ago with a debate on the resolution, "legalize a market in human organs." and it proved to be one of the most successful debates we'd ever done. %$* 1
even though it's not going to happen probably in our lifetime. %$* 13
the point was to explore the pros and the cons and the ethical issues involved. %$* 13
exactly. %$* 1
so tonight's debate, how radical a notion really is it to let anyone take a job anywhere? %$* 13
well, it is not that radical a notion. %$* 1
it's a notion that's been applied for decades in the european union. %$* 1
and the result has been very good for people who employ migrant labor. %$* 1
it's been very good for the people who use their services and the customers. %$* 1
it has not been so good for people who have to compete. %$* 1
and in britain they call this the polish plumber problem. %$* 1
and when you look at this motion language, “let anyone take a job anywhere," how literally do you think that we should expect the debaters to be arguing "anyone anywhere"? %$* 13
well, the motion language is pretty extreme, i must admit, and not terribly nuanced, but a motion that said, let more people take more jobs in more places would hardly have been a good debate. %$* 1
but i would expect-- %$* 1
everybody would be against that, right? %$* 13
i would expect, though, that we're going to hear tonight ideas about how to take the free market further in the context of labor markets. %$* 1
so, for example, it would hardly be that radical to have a treaty between the united states and the eu and canada providing for free market of labor in those areas. %$* 1
but i think we're going to learn a lot tonight about the various aspects of a complicated topic. %$* 1
all right. %$* 13
thanks, bob. %$* 13
very much. %$* 13
and i would like to now invite our debaters to the stage. %$* 13
thank you, john. %$* 1
thanks. %$* 1
the lights were a little soft on me up here, and i was just waiting for them to come up. %$* 13
it's not an ego thing. %$* 13
it's a camera thing. %$* 13
before we start, though, again, i just want to thank bob rosenkranz for bringing these debates here, and just want to ask them for one more round of applause for that. %$* 13
one of the oven overlooked assumptions about life in these united states is that built into that word "united," that we're all part of the same polity and that-- %$* 13
and we have the rights within our borders to go anywhere we want in pursuit of a job. %$* 13
you're from north dakota, there is nothing in the law to stop you from going to get a job in north carolina. %$* 13
and europe has taken that idea a lot further with one shared open market for two dozen plus countries so that a chip maker in dublin or an insurance company in sophia can hire the best people affordable from finland to france or from estonia to austria. %$* 13
so what is the lesson? %$* 13
or more to the point for us, what if the u.s. set out to make deals, partnership deals, with other open labor markets? %$* 13
say the u.s.does a deal with europe, the u.s.and canada or the u.s.and india or the u.s.and china. %$* 13
when the barriers to labor fall, who would gain and who would lose? %$* 13
now, this is a big what if but it sounds like there's a lot to debate in there. %$* 13
so let's have it, yes or no to this statement, “let anyone take a job anywhere," a debate from intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we are at the kauffman music center in new york city. %$* 13
we have four superbly qualified debaters, two against two, who will take opposite sides on this motion, “let anyone take a job anywhere." our debate as always goes in three rounds, and then the audience votes to choose a winner, and only one side wins. %$* 13
our motion, again, is “let anyone take a job anywhere." and now let's meet the team first that is arguing for the motion. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, please welcome bryan caplan. %$* 13
and, bryan, you are a professor of economics at george mason university. %$* 13
you are a well-known proponent of open borders. %$* 13
you wrote a book called, "the myth of the rational voter," in which you puzzled over the question of why democracies so often make bad policy choices. %$* 13
you list price controls and protectionism and other populist policies that you say most economists would never vote for. %$* 13
so we're just wondering, tonight we have 400 people in the audience, if these were all economists in front of you, would your side have the advantage tonight? %$* 13
probably a slight advantage. %$* 210
economists are definitely much more pro-immigration than most americans, but economists also don't like to be extreme. %$* 210
i'm an exception. %$* 210
all right, thank you. %$* 13
thank you, bryan caplan, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 13
and, bryan, your partner is? %$* 13
vivek wadhwa, god of twitter. %$* 210
ladies and gentlemen-- %$* 13
let's welcome vivek wadhwa. %$* 13
vivek, you are also arguing for this motion, “let anyone take a job anywhere." you are vice president of research and innovation at singularity university. %$* 13
you are a fellow at stanford law school. %$* 13
before joining academia you actually started two software companies. %$* 13
you were born in india. %$* 13
you went to nyu business school, became a naturalized citizen in 1989. just curious, if this were all happening in your life now, business school, 2013, 2014, would you go to india now or would you still want to stay here? %$* 13
john, i wouldn't have had a choice. %$* 211
i couldn't get a visa. %$* 211
we will close the doors. %$* 211
we'd lock the borders. %$* 211
we're turning away brilliant people because of our flawed immigration policies. %$* 211
so i would have had to leave. %$* 211
well, you're here now. %$* 13
i'm here now. %$* 211
ladies and gentlemen, let's welcome vivek wadhwa. %$* 13
our motion is “let anyone take a job anywhere," and now let's meet this team that is arguing against this motion. %$* 13
first, ladies and gentlemen, let's welcome kathleen newland. %$* 13
kathleen, you are cofounder of the migration policy institute. %$* 13
you study migration, development, refugee protection. %$* 13
you have advised the u.n.high commissioner on refugees and the international labor organization. %$* 13
and part of what inspired you to go into this field is something that you did at a very young age. %$* 13
you were 16 years old, and you were an exchange student where? %$* 13
i went to calcutta at the age of 16, very brave parents. %$* 212
it is an experience that utterly changed my life. %$* 212
and that's how you ended up in a way here. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, let's welcome kathleen newland. %$* 13
and, kathleen, your partner is? %$* 13
ron unz. %$* 212
ladies and gentlemen, ron unz. %$* 13
you have one of those very, very disparate resumes that intelligence squared loves. %$* 13
you're a physicist by training. %$* 13
but then you were a founder and chairman of wall street analytics, which is a financial services software company. %$* 13
then you ran for governor of california. %$* 13
then you were a publisher of the american conservative. %$* 13
you've been described, quote, unquote, as a "nerdy guy who lives and breathes policy and politics." and i hope you know that in the intelligence squared universe that makes you a sex symbol. %$* 13
well, i guess we'll find out when the vote takes place. %$* 213
ladies and gentlemen, our debaters. %$* 13
now, i want to remind you that this is a debate. %$* 13
it's a contest. %$* 13
there will be a winner and a loser, and you, our live audience at the kauffman music center here in new york city, will choose the winners by voting twice, once before the debate and once again after the debate. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers have moved the most in terms of your support for their side of the motion in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so let's go to our preliminary vote. %$* 13
you go to those keypads at your seat, and look at numbers one, two, and three. %$* 13
you can ignore the other ones. %$* 13
but if you look at our motion: let anyone take a job anywhere-- %$* 13
and if you agree with that at this point, you want to push number one. %$* 13
if you disagree with that, you want to push number two. %$* 13
and if you're undecided, you want to push number three. %$* 13
and if you push the wrong button, you can just correct yourself. %$* 13
the system will lock in your last vote. %$* 13
then again, at the end of the debate, we'll repeat that exercise. %$* 13
again, the team whose numbers have changed the most in percentage point terms from their opening positions will be declared our winner. %$* 13
and at the end of the debate, it takes us about 90 seconds to get that calculation taken care of. %$* 13
jon, i just want to ask if i could get a pen at some point. %$* 13
but-- %$* 13
wait, don't you need that for-- %$* 13
oh, great, thank you. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
perfect. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
this has all these secret messages. %$* 13
there's been notes written on here. %$* 13
crib notes. %$* 13
that's the wrong pen. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
onto round 1-- %$* 13
opening statements from each of our debaters. %$* 13
they will be seven minutes each, uninterrupted. %$* 13
our motion is this: let anyone take a job anywhere. %$* 13
and speaking first for the motion, bryan caplan, a professor of economics at george mason university and senior scholar at the mercatus center. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, bryan caplan. %$* 13
let anyone take a job anywhere. %$* 210
given current policy, it does sound radical. %$* 210
but notice, the resolution does not say "let anyone become a citizen anywhere.” the resolution does not say "let anyone collect government benefits anywhere.” the respondent does not say "let anyone vote anywhere.” the resolution only says that no matter where you're born, it should be legal for you to accept a job offer from a willing employer. %$* 210
the resolution parallels-- %$* 210
let any woman take a job anywhere, or let any jew take a job anywhere, or let any black take a job anywhere. %$* 210
the resolution is not a request for charity and it is not a demand for government help. %$* 210
it simply asks the world's governments to stop requiring discrimination against foreign workers. %$* 210
but most arguments focus on high-skilled, high-tech workers. %$* 210
i outsourced this topic to my partner, vivek wadhwa. %$* 210
i'm going to focus on the vast majority of would-be immigrations who aren't high-skilled or high-tech. %$* 210
haitian shoe shines. %$* 210
nigerian waiters. %$* 210
mexican gardeners. %$* 210
bangladeshi farmers. %$* 210
now, why on earth shouldn't we require discrimination against such people? %$* 210
who would want them? %$* 210
you know, the same reason that we shouldn't require discrimination against women, against jews, or against blacks. %$* 210
they're fellow human beings. %$* 210
and they count. %$* 210
now, suppose the world's governments made it illegal for ron to work anywhere but haiti. %$* 210
would that be morally acceptable, to trap ron in haiti for the rest of his life? %$* 210
mandatory discrimination against foreigners is especially awful, because most of the world's workers earn vastly more in the first world than they ever could at home. %$* 210
moving from haiti to miami increases your wages by about 20 times. %$* 210
that is not plus 20 percent. %$* 210
that is not plus 200 percent. %$* 210
that is plus 2,000 percent. %$* 210
now, you could object that we're not obliged to help total strangers. %$* 210
you know, you'll say-- %$* 210
but the important point is, remember, allowing someone to take a job is not charity. %$* 210
let me repeat that. %$* 210
allowing someone to take a job is not charity. %$* 210
what is it? %$* 210
it's call minimal decency. %$* 210
so, suppose that kathleen were to get a job. %$* 210
if i refrain from slashing her car tires on her first day of work, that does not make me a philanthropist. %$* 210
i am not starting the "save kathleen newland fund" when i don't vandalize her car. %$* 210
i'm merely leaving kathleen alone. %$* 210
now, sometimes tragically, just leaving someone alone has enormous costs. %$* 210
for example, if someone has bubonic plague, a quarantine really is the lesser evil. %$* 210
if you leave the person with bubonic plague free to roam, he could kill millions of people. %$* 210
would open borders wreck comparable harm on our economy? %$* 210
no. %$* 210
every scholarly estimate of the economic effects of open borders finds enormous overall benefits. %$* 210
economist michael clemens, the world's expert on this topic, finds that a free global labor market would roughly double global production. %$* 210
now, this point he makes-- %$* 210
double, how is it possible to double global production? %$* 210
well, consider this thought experiment. %$* 210
imagine there were a billion farmers stuck in antarctica farming the snow. %$* 210
all right. %$* 210
i don't know a lot about farming, but it sounds tough. %$* 210
all right. %$* 210
now, suppose we were to let these billion farmers move from antarctica to anywhere else. %$* 210
anywhere with decent soil, decent weather, decent conditions. %$* 210
well, obviously, the billion antarcticans would be way better off when they get to leave antarctica. %$* 210
but they are hardly the only beneficiaries. %$* 210
the other beneficiaries of allowing them to leave antarctica are everyone on earth who eats food, everyone on the-- %$* 210
everyone on earth who eats food benefits from that greater availability of food. %$* 210
now, economically speaking, haiti and bangladesh really are like antarctica. %$* 210
they're countries where workers realize only a small sliver of their full potential. %$* 210
ask yourself this: what is the best job that you could get in bangladesh? %$* 210
not very good. %$* 210
now, wouldn't open borders hurt american workers? %$* 210
some. %$* 210
take me. %$* 210
i am a native born college professor. %$* 210
thanks to a massive immigration loophole, virtually any phd in the world can legally compete with me in the u.s.labor market. %$* 210
as a result, about half of all u.s.research professors are foreign born. %$* 210
this has slashed my wages and my career prospects. %$* 210
right now, there is probably an immigrant sitting at harvard in the office that is supposed to be mine. %$* 210
now, is my sad, sad story a good argument for immigration restrictions? %$* 210
sure, it's a great argument. %$* 210
wait. %$* 210
no, it's a terrible argument. %$* 210
professorial immigration is bad for me, but it's good for consumers of education. %$* 210
if you're glad that you didn't pay even more for your college education, thank an immigrant. %$* 210
the same goes for every occupation. %$* 210
immigration of waiters is bad for native born waiters, but it's good for diners. %$* 210
immigration of gardeners is bad for native born gardeners, but it's good for homeowners. %$* 210
so how on earth could we ever judge the overall effect? %$* 210
there is a very simple answer. %$* 210
keep both eyes firmly on production. %$* 210
keep both eyes firmly on production. %$* 210
when global production doubles, your standard of living is very likely to rise. %$* 210
this is not trickle-down economics. %$* 210
it is niagara falls economics. %$* 210
now, what about the endless, noneconomic complaints about immigration? %$* 210
i'm sure we'll get into an enormous number as we go on. %$* 210
so i will just give you a general rule for how i respond to all of them. %$* 210
here is the rule: for any complaint you have, there is a cheaper and more human main remedy than mandatory discrimination against foreigners. %$* 210
immigrants have used the welfare state. %$* 210
let them work, but not collect benefits. %$* 210
immigrants damage the environment. %$* 210
let them work but tax their pollution. %$* 210
immigrants vote the wrong way, let them work but not vote. %$* 210
immigrants hurt well- skilled americans. %$* 210
let them work but charge immigrants an admission fee or a surtax. %$* 210
then use those funds to compensate native workers who lose out. %$* 210
if you think these remedies are unfair, they are certainly less unfair than turning honest workers into criminals just because they were born in the wrong country. %$* 210
to conclude, let-- %$* 210
let anyone take a job anywhere. %$* 210
it is the right way to treat your fellow human beings. %$* 210
it will transform the world for the better, and it will cost us less than nothing. %$* 210
thank you. %$* 210
thank you, bryan caplan. %$* 13
and our motion is, let anyone take a job anywhere. %$* 13
and here to speak against the motion, i'd like to introduce ron unz. %$* 13
he founded the financial services company wall street analytics and is the former publisher of the american conservative. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, ron unz. %$* 13
i'll admit, when i was first approached with this topic, the resolution being, “let anyone take a job anywhere," i thought the idea was so crazy it would be very hard to get anybody lined up on the other side. %$* 213
but obviously we've found a couple of intelligent people to do that. %$* 213
let's think a little bit about what this means. %$* 213
now, you know, i'm laboring under a disadvantage in this debate because not only am i not a trained economist, i've never even taken a class in economics. %$* 213
i've never even opened an economics textbook. %$* 213
i personally don't claim to really understand most economics. %$* 213
i'm not convinced everybody else understands economics that well either. %$* 213
but one part of economics that is very well-established, a very simple issue, is the law of supply and demand. %$* 213
think of what production means. %$* 213
the two main factors in production are labor and capital. %$* 213
together, those factors produce everything we have in our society. %$* 213
allowing an unlimited number of additional workers from everywhere in the world to come here and take jobs would massively, massively increase the supply of labor. %$* 213
the result would be tremendously disadvantaging labor at the expense of capital. %$* 213
in effect, order workers, ordinary citizens, people basically who work for a living would be tremendously economically disadvantaged by the fact that they would be competing against a billion, 2 billion, 3 billion, an unlimited supply of additional foreign workers who would take the job for whatever wage they could. %$* 213
it's true, certainly, there would be a huge increase in economic production, productivity, gnp.but almost all of it, and possibly even more than all of it would be captured by capital, captured by the wealthy people on that side of the equation. %$* 213
in other words, what we're talking about is something that would be very beneficial for the top 1 percent, .1 percent, 2 percent, 5 percent, the wealthiest segment of american society. %$* 213
they would benefit, no doubt about it. %$* 213
everybody else would suffer. %$* 213
i think that's very clear, because when you're talking about basically a hundred million or 150 million american workers, suddenly competing in an open labor market with a billion or 2 billion or 3 billion impoverished people from everywhere else in the world, they certainly would suffer. %$* 213
now, let's think of what really has happened in american society over the last 20, 30, 40 years. %$* 213
the late daniel patrick moynihan, over 20 years ago, pointed out that for two decades there had been no increase in average wage income in the united states. %$* 213
the standard of living of ordinary american workers had been stagnant for two decades. %$* 213
he said that 20 years ago. %$* 213
it's now been 40 years. %$* 213
the income of the average american has been stagnant or declining for 40 years now, which is a shocking statistic that most people are not aware of. %$* 213
clearly, there have been advances in technology so that in many ways people have a much better life than they did before with iphones, with google, with things like that. %$* 213
but in terms of real income, people are basically the same or poorer than they were decades ago. %$* 213
and as moynihan pointed out in the '90s, that's the longest period of economic stagnation that has happened in north america since european settlement began hundreds of years ago. %$* 213
now, is it entirely coincidence that 40 years of economic stagnation for ordinary american workers is the same 40 years that has seen one of the highest rates of foreign immigration to the united states in our history? %$* 213
i think it's more than a coincidence. %$* 213
the point is, if you have a huge influx of willing workers from abroad, able to take any job they could because they come from poor countries, you're going to drive down the wages of ordinary american workers who are competing with them. %$* 213
allowing anyone to take a job anywhere in effect would convert america's minimum wage into its maximum wage. %$* 213
and if you see the complaints right now over the 1 percent, over the wealthy elite who have tremendously benefited in the last few decades, while ordinary people, ordinary people in new york city or other places around the country have suffered, that would be tremendously exacerbated if you brought in tens or even hundreds of millions of impoverished workers from other countries to take their places. %$* 213
now, the point is, when you're talking about the result of economic stagnation in the united states that has now gone on for 40 years for ordinary workers, the end result at some point may be severe political backlash. %$* 213
and that sort of thing is inevitable. %$* 213
the reason america in its history, largely avoided the disastrous political results of many european countries is that every decade americans were wealthier and better off than they were before. %$* 213
that's no longer true today. %$* 213
and it's no longer been true for 40 years now. %$* 213
allowing an unlimited number of impoverished foreign workers to come to the united states would obviously make that situation incredibly much worse. %$* 213
and the result would be an economic disaster. %$* 213
it's true that possibly 1 percent or 2 percent or even 5 percent of americans would benefit tremendously from that change. %$* 213
but probably 90 percent of the american population would suffer economically. %$* 213
and they are the people who vote. %$* 213
they are the people who can protest. %$* 213
and their views would certainly be made known. %$* 213
and the result would be tremendous political backlash. %$* 213
we have to ask ourselves whether one reason for many of the problems we've had in the last few decades economically is because the glorification, the amplification of theoretical concepts that may look very good to pure economic theorists, people basically spend their time in the ivory tower, but don't understand that ordinary workers suffer when their incomes don't rise for 40 years. %$* 213
and i think, unfortunately, that's probably true today. %$* 213
one other aspect of the american political dynamic has been that there's an increasing centralization of politics in the hands of wealth; in other words, the people who fund the campaigns, the organizations that fund the campaigns. %$* 213
and when you have the wealthy people benefiting tremendously from a proposal like this, and everybody else suffering. %$* 213
but when the wealthy people fund the politicians, they fund the think tanks, they fund the universities, they fund the journals; it's not too surprising that some of these ideas become very common in such circles even if the end result would be disastrous for the united states. %$* 213
the bottom line is that letting anyone take a job anywhere might sound good in theory but it would destroy the united states and destroy the lives of ordinary workers. %$* 213
thank you very much. %$* 213
thank you, ron unz. %$* 13
and a reminder of what's going on, we are halfway through this opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two on opposite sides of this motion, "let anyone take a job anywhere." you have heard the first two debaters, and now on to the third. %$* 13
let's welcome to the lectern vivek wadhwa. %$* 13
he is the vice president of research and innovation at singularity university and a fellow at stanford law school. %$* 13
he is arguing for the motion, "let anyone take a job anywhere." ladies and gentlemen, vivek wadhwa. %$* 13
you know, i've read ron's writings. %$* 211
i've watched his videos. %$* 211
and that's not the ron that i've read. %$* 211
the ron that i've read about is not one of these tea party anti-immigrant people who goes around creating fear about the billions who are going to invade america and take away our jobs and so on. %$* 211
those are the debates that are happening in washington, d.c.by a small segment of congress, which has been elected through a gerrymandered electorate. %$* 211
that is not the real world. %$* 211
that is not how americans think. %$* 211
the fear we've had about mexicans coming in and taking our jobs away, they're-- %$* 211
and then indians coming in and taking our jobs away, they've not been founded. %$* 211
now, bryan explained what's happening in the unskilled sector. %$* 211
i've been researching systematically what's happening in the skilled sector, because you have the same fear mongering happening in skilled immigration, that, "my god, these indians, they're going to come and take our jobs away. %$* 211
if we expanded which one be the american workers, we all be unemployed." the exact opposite is happening. %$* 211
america is the most competitive land in the world. %$* 211
we have reinvented ourselves over and over again. %$* 211
diversity rules over here. %$* 211
look at new york city. %$* 211
it is diverse as could possibly be. %$* 211
the economy is thriving. %$* 211
people are doing much better. %$* 211
look at the benefits we've seen from technology, all of the advances that ron talked about, our iphones, our googles. %$* 211
the fact is the world is connected right now. %$* 211
we have more knowledge than we've ever had. %$* 211
knowledge has become free. %$* 211
it used to be that if you needed to get information about your health you had to go to your doctor. %$* 211
that's it. %$* 211
now you just google and download apps and you have medical information readily at your fingertips. %$* 211
that happened because of technology. %$* 211
and you know who's been building these technologies? %$* 211
immigrants, 52 percent of the startups in silicon valley during the most innovative period in recent economic history were founded by immigrants, people like me, people like this audience, people who came here because they saw opportunity, they were highly educated, and they decided to bring their knowledge and their intelligence with them over here and make america a competitive place. %$* 211
this is what's made this land what it is. %$* 211
in every generation there were people like-- %$* 211
i mean this is not ron. %$* 211
i mean i could have-- %$* 211
i've heard his-- %$* 211
actually i've seen his writing. %$* 211
this was not-- %$* 211
i don't believe what he just said over here. %$* 211
every generation-- %$* 211
in every generation there have been people who said that "if we let these irish in, if we let these poles in, if we let these jews in, if we let these people in our jobs will go away." and guess what happened? %$* 211
these immigrants made americans work harder, think smarter, compete, and this became the only innovative economy in the world. %$* 211
we lead the world because of innovation, because we open our borders, and because we allow people to come in here. %$* 211
now, that's one perspective. %$* 211
the other perspective is that i hate to tell you this but the cat is already out of the bag. %$* 211
how many of you check email when you go home? %$* 211
all of you do. %$* 211
right? %$* 211
now, when you go on vacation, do you check email? %$* 211
all of you do. %$* 211
well, most of you do. %$* 211
let’s say you decided to work for six months in south america and your job was highly-- %$* 211
a knowledge job, as are many jobs increasingly right now, you'd be working from anywhere. %$* 211
therefore, anyone else could work from anywhere as well. %$* 211
you know, this is getting a little bit off topic, but the point i wanted to make was that already we are in a borderless economy when it comes to knowledge. %$* 211
we are in a knowledge economy. %$* 211
knowledge jobs can be done anywhere. %$* 211
boeing has engineers working in four or five different countries at the same time, designing aircraft systems, as do most companies. %$* 211
if you-- %$* 211
and maybe you work for large corporations. %$* 211
i'm sure you've had meetings with people in all corners of the world. %$* 211
you're working together because of what technology has made possible. %$* 211
we are already in a borderless economy. %$* 211
i live it. %$* 211
i have a job at duke university, yet i live in silicon valley. %$* 211
my dean over there allows me to work from anywhere i want to work. %$* 211
i also work for stanford. %$* 211
i also work for singularity university. %$* 211
i also have a role at emory university. %$* 211
i'm able to be at many different places because i can go over the internet and now teach lectures. %$* 211
i can do research. %$* 211
i can do the things i needed to do. %$* 211
one of the things i've been researching is the role of women in innovation or the lack of women in innovation, the fact that they're left out of the innovation economy. %$* 211
it's something i feel very passionate about. %$* 211
i did a research project. %$* 211
i had a team leader in washington d.c.i had other researchers in new york city. %$* 211
we needed a website; we got it built at stanford. %$* 211
and we needed a video. %$* 211
we got it done in estonia. %$* 211
i want to crowd-create a book. %$* 211
i put the word out there, i'm looking for people to help me with social media. %$* 211
i had 300 women all over the world sign up to be my ambassadors. %$* 211
i wanted to now crowd-edit the book. %$* 211
i had 500 women all over the world telling their stories. %$* 211
i could do within six weeks the research that would have taken me years and years to do by using the power of the web, by using the power of technology, and by letting people work from anywhere. %$* 211
this is a new world. %$* 211
and i crowd-created a book on innovation. %$* 211
this would have been unconceivable even five years ago. %$* 211
so you talk about the damage that open borders are doing. %$* 211
i'm sorry. %$* 211
it's happening right now. %$* 211
the topic we're talking about is let the jobs do anywhere. %$* 211
no one said, "let the migration be anywhere.” no one said that a billion mexicans have to come to the usa and take our jobs away. %$* 211
because we have the unskilled jobs, which bryan will talk more about, and we've got the skilled jobs. %$* 211
the skilled jobs is what most of us in this room do. %$* 211
they can be done anywhere, because we're knowledge workers and we're in a knowledge economy. %$* 211
we're now connected to the internet. %$* 211
anything can be done anywhere. %$* 211
and it's happening. %$* 211
over the last five years, we have not seen a decrease in productivity. %$* 211
we've seen an increase in productivity. %$* 211
i'm more capable right now-- %$* 211
i'm more connected right now. %$* 211
i go on twitter and i tweet, "i need some information," and i have hundreds of people all over the world now doing my research for me and providing me back what i need. %$* 211
that's the power of connectivity, the web. %$* 211
that's the world we're in right now. %$* 211
and we have the free flow of information. %$* 211
we have open borders right now on the internet. %$* 211
that didn't cause our productivity to decrease or our jobs to go away or the catastrophe that, you know, my opponents are saying. %$* 211
it's caused me to be more productive. %$* 211
it causes you to be more productive. %$* 211
it causes you to be smarter. %$* 211
your children right now have access to the world knowledge. %$* 211
they just get on their ipads or their iphones and they're connected to everyone else by social media, by twitter. %$* 211
they're able to go into websites. %$* 211
they're able to gain knowledge from everywhere. %$* 211
they would hire in new delhi or get video production done in estonia, like i did. %$* 211
this is a new world we live in. %$* 211
it's all open. %$* 211
and it's not falling apart. %$* 211
we're moving up the ramp. %$* 211
this is the most productive, most innovative period in human history, when the world will come together and start solving problems. %$* 211
there's not going to be a mass migration to america, because as we see, from mexico, the numbers have actually dropped. %$* 211
as the economy in mexico rises, there's less incentive for them to come over here. %$* 211
if they can do knowledge work for us where they are and contribute to our intellect and our knowledge, they will do that. %$* 211
they don't want to be here. %$* 211
they love being where they are. %$* 211
no one is fleeing to america because, you know, they want to. %$* 211
they do it because they have to. %$* 211
so, let's uplift the whole world. %$* 211
let's make the world a smaller place and everyone wins. %$* 211
it's a better world. %$* 211
it's a better economy. %$* 211
and we solve major problems. %$* 211
yes. %$* 19
all of you do. %$* 211
well, most of you do. %$* 211
let’s say you decided to work for six months in south america and your job was highly-- %$* 211

you talk about the bureaucracy and the money that's spent on football, maybe that money, maybe the general student population-- %$* 310
40 hours a week doing what? %$* 308
40 hours a week studying, 40 hours-- %$* 310
where'd you get that from? %$* 308
a week playing football. %$* 310
from the ncaa. %$* 310
i think-- %$* 308
personally, i think-- %$* 308
listen, you know, buzz, let's not get into where we got stuff, where you got your numbers where i got mine. %$* 310
buzz hang on a second and just let-- %$* 13
buzz, hang on a second. %$* 13
i'll come back to you. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
go ahead, tim. %$* 13
finish your point. %$* 13
so-- %$* 310
so football's doing a good job. %$* 310
they're doing a good job educating their players. %$* 310
they're educating them at a better and a higher rate than the general population. %$* 310
maybe academia should take a page out of the playbook from the football program. %$* 310
malcolm gladwell, your opponent said-- %$* 13
your opponent's made the point-- %$* 13
your opponent's made the point that football players' rate of graduation is actually increasing. %$* 13
can you take that on? %$* 13
well, first of all, that's small comfort if you get a degree in a short term and a massive brain injury in the long term. %$* 309
but secondly-- %$* 309
you can't-- %$* 310
let him finish. %$* 13
but you can't say that. %$* 310
let him finish. %$* 13
the other thing that i-- %$* 309
almost everything that our two opponents said, i agree with if they simply substituted in another sport for football, right? %$* 309
the issue is not that football does all kinds of wonderful things. %$* 309
of course it does. %$* 309
do football players graduate? %$* 309
of course they do. %$* 309
do they learn all kinds of wonderful character things? %$* 309
absolutely. %$* 309
but do we have to bash them over the head in order to communicate those virtues? %$* 309
why can't they row? %$* 309
why can't they kick a soccer ball? %$* 309
why can't they-- %$* 309
they can, but those sports won't generate-- %$* 311
jason whitlock. %$* 13
they won't generate enough money to sustain themselves. %$* 311
and again, i just want to go back to-- %$* 311
it's about money now? %$* 309
they have to get hit over the head because they can't get money otherwise? %$* 309
in terms of funding all the other sports you're talking about that you like. %$* 311
yes, they do have to get hit over the head on saturdays to pay for that, absolutely. %$* 311
but jason, jason, you're-- %$* 308
to pay for the rowing team and the soccer team and all the other sports that no one cares about. %$* 311
yes. %$* 311
buzz bissinger. %$* 13
your argument is a perfect argument for why football should not be at academic institutions. %$* 308
make it into a minor league system then. %$* 308
you'll get the same benefits that you're talking about. %$* 308
the melting pot-- %$* 308
by the way, the melting pot also, i think, includes latinos and asian-americans. %$* 308
and if you can name four jews who played football, you win the debate. %$* 308
tim green. %$* 13
and i can name you the only one, which was sid luckman from columbia. %$* 308
tim-- %$* 13
tim green. %$* 13
malcolm, malcolm, all due-- %$* 310
however, %$* 308
malcolm, wait. %$* 310
i'm talking to malcolm now. %$* 310
i'll talk to you out back later on. %$* 310
i'm going to kick your ass! %$* 308
and i will defy you, buzz bissinger. %$* 310
tim green. %$* 13
malcolm, you know, all due respect, you're talking about all this damage that's done to the brain, okay? %$* 310
show me the studies. %$* 310
show me proof, because what i'm looking at right here is indirect fatalities. %$* 310
you said, why couldn't they be rowing? %$* 310
per hundred thousand students, student athletes, in rowing, how many indirect fatalities a year? %$* 310
16. how many in football? %$* 310
2.2. so why are we going to let them row? %$* 310
but you, it's-- %$* 309
look, you've got to look at numbers. %$* 310
you can't just say-- %$* 310
you can't just throw it out there and say, oh, it does all this damage, a hundred gs which is-- %$* 310
that's not correct. %$* 310
all this damage to the head. %$* 310
look, if there is long-term damage to the brain, okay, and maybe i'm living proof of it. %$* 310
but if there is long-term damage to the brain, i'm the first one to say, boy, maybe we should look at it. %$* 310
but do we eliminate all these other-- %$* 310
well, you can't-- %$* 309
malcolm gladwell. %$* 13
sports as well? %$* 310
malcolm. %$* 13
here's the thing. %$* 309
at that moment in your-- %$* 309
in your remarks when you were comparing fatality rates between sports, i was incredulous. %$* 309
i was too. %$* 310
we're not talking about-- %$* 309
i'm not talking about fatalities on the field. %$* 309
we're talking about long-term health consequences that show up 20 and 30 years later. %$* 309
show me the studies. %$* 310
here's why we don't know what the long-term consequences of football are, because you have to shoot yourself and have an autopsy before we know whether you have cte in your brain. %$* 309
yeah, but-- %$* 310
you know what? %$* 310
let me-- %$* 310
jason whitlock. %$* 13
diagnose it until you're dead. %$* 309
jason whitlock. %$* 13
i think, though, we're so caught up in the junior seau, dave duerson and the aberrations. %$* 311
i don't think that's the norm. %$* 311
i don't think that-- %$* 311
and yes, they make news, and they-- %$* 311
we can write about them, and people will be interested in it. %$* 311
i think what we're arcing, malcolm, is that's not the case for the overwhelming majority of people that play football, because the overwhelming majority stop in high school. %$* 311
and then the next big group stops at college. %$* 311
and now we have some examples of a few pro athletes that have had these amazing problems. %$* 311
we haven't seen the studies that say college athletes-- %$* 311
the two-- %$* 13
in any significant number have these problems. %$* 311
jason, the two of you who have played, i want to ask you, i mean, given the arguments made on the other side, you both probably hit your head a bunch of times. %$* 13
i mean, they're arguing you're two very successful guys, you might be a lot more successful if you hadn't played football. %$* 13
but do you actually worry about the statistics that malcolm is citing, since you both have played the game? %$* 13
do you worry about it? %$* 13
i have concerns, but this is the cell phone syndrome, folks. %$* 310
ten years ago, people said, "cell phones, cell phones next to the head. %$* 310
it's brain cancer. %$* 310
cell phones, brain cancer." and everyone said, oh, my gosh, cell phones, brain cancer. %$* 310
and i'm walking around, my wife's saying, "you can't use your cell phone. %$* 310
you can't hold it next to your head." and i started to believe it. %$* 310
i'm like, yeah, yeah, i've got to use my speakerphone. %$* 310
i've got to use the thing. %$* 310
guess what? %$* 310
they've done studies, long-term studies, and they found there is no correlation between cell phones and brain cancer. %$* 310
wait, wait. %$* 309
so until you-- %$* 310
until you-- %$* 310
name the last time someone shot themself in the chest because of cell phone use? %$* 309
malcolm, you're taking-- %$* 310
no, no. %$* 309
no, you're doing-- %$* 310
you're taking-- %$* 310
you're taking, as jason said, at aberration. %$* 310
you're-- %$* 310
i did because i use at&t. %$* 308
there are 64-- %$* 309
there are 64 players in the national football league who are currently suing the league over their brain injuries, right? %$* 309
that is the thin end of the wedge. %$* 309
we don't know how large the group of affected players is. %$* 309
and the question for us is-- %$* 309
we can't use lawsuits. %$* 18
until we know, until we know what the extent of the medical damage is, what is the appropriate position to take as custodians of the-- %$* 309
of the personal intellectual development of young people? %$* 309
buzz bissinger. %$* 13
well, i mean, listen, our-- %$* 308
have the studies been definitive? %$* 308
no. %$* 308
however-- %$* 308
thank you. %$* 310
of the-- %$* 308
but wait a sec. %$* 308
bu has studied the brains of 44 players who died early either because of alzheimer's, suicide, which is a very, very complex issue, i agree with jason about why junior seau died. %$* 308
we don't know. %$* 308
but in each of those 44 brains, they found advanced cte.their brains were shriveled. %$* 308
the first case was andre waters who shot himself at the age of 43. %$* 308
forget suicide, when they looked at his brain, they said he had the brain of a 67-year-old man, and you know, you know how andre waters played, he probably suffered 25 to 30 concussions during his career. %$* 308
so you have 44 cases in which there were advanced signs of cte in players who either had alzheimer's, early alzheimer's, or died. %$* 308
so there are studies. %$* 308
there are studies. %$* 308
and i-- %$* 308
there are 6,000 former nfl players over the last 20 years, and you're talking about-- %$* 310
a thousand are filing suit. %$* 308
take 6,000 clergymen, 6,000 university professors, 6,000 bus drivers, here's-- %$* 310
but tim, there's a class action suit filed by a thousand nfl players. %$* 308
i don't want to be this cynical, but-- %$* 311
i don't want to be this cynical, but this is also america. %$* 311
we sue over everything. %$* 311
you get broke and desperate, you-- %$* 311
seriously, i've written about this in the past, about remember we had this whole deal about the old nfl players not being taken care of by the current players. %$* 311
and i called it "the old nfl-- %$* 311
" they want reparations because they're jealous of how much money the current players are making. %$* 311
do you honestly think-- %$* 308
absolutely, absolutely. %$* 311
tim, now, let me ask you, you played. %$* 308
is suing a good thing, like cigarettes, porn, and football? %$* 310
no, but it's just what we do. %$* 311
everybody-- %$* 311
if you can't earn it, you'll sue somebody to get it. %$* 311
malcolm gladwell. %$* 13
that's america. %$* 311
malcolm gladwell. %$* 13
i think all of you are-- %$* 309
the two of you are sidestepping the crucial fact here, and that is, yes, this is a complex topic, yes, this is clearly a heated topic, yes, we don't know what the full extent of this damage is, the issue is what do we do at our institutions of higher learning in the interim. %$* 309
that's what i want to respond to. %$* 310
right? %$* 309
that's what i want to respond to. %$* 310
what is the prudent step? %$* 309
and you guys seem to take the position that until we have definitive proof-- %$* 309
the appropriate step to take is to walk things back. %$* 311
they're playing too many games, i agree. %$* 311
they should walk it back to 11 games. %$* 311
the coaches are earning too much. %$* 311
they should share some with the players. %$* 311
they should have less padded practices and less contact-- %$* 311
they should walk things back until we figure it out. %$* 311
you don't just jump to banning-- %$* 311
right. %$* 18
we would have banned cell phones 10 years ago-- %$* 311
you're yielding-- %$* 13
neither of you-- %$* 18
you're actually yielding a lot of their points, that there's a real problem there, so you do yield-- %$* 13
no one denies there's a problem. %$* 311
there was a problem back in 1976-- %$* 310
so the head injuries are real and the money problem is real. %$* 13
look it, helmets have got better in 1976, the rules changed in 1976, absolutely. %$* 310
i mean, we're not saying, "oh, you know, just go on-- %$* 310
carry on as usual." yeah, change the rules a little bit, continue to modify, have the strike zone, no helmets to helmet hits-- %$* 310
hang on, buzz-- %$* 310
i'm with you. %$* 308
yeah, modify the rules, pay the players, keep making the helmets safer and safer which they are, do everything we can to protect, but don't-- %$* 310
this is america. %$* 310
we don't ban things. %$* 310
people can burn the flag. %$* 310
we don't ban that. %$* 310
you don't ban college football. %$* 310
buzz bissinger. %$* 13
but the greater issue, which neither of you have answered, is what is the academic purpose of football on a university campus, and why are we the only nation in the world that looks to universities to provide a primary source of athletic entertainment? %$* 308
you talk about kids getting-- %$* 308
you know what the graduation rate of football players should be? %$* 308
100 percent. %$* 308
do you know why? %$* 308
they get a free scholarship, not only that-- %$* 308
it's not free, buzz. %$* 310
they get a-- %$* 308
it's not free. %$* 310
you work for it. %$* 310
tim, i didn't interrupt you. %$* 308
do not interrupt me. %$* 308
they get a scholarship. %$* 308
beyond that, you have the phil knights and the university of texas. %$* 308
phil knight built a $44 million taj mahal academic support center for student athletes. %$* 308
why doesn't he build it for the average student? %$* 308
they get tutors. %$* 308
tim green. %$* 13
they get every ancillary benefit. %$* 308
okay. %$* 13
and the graduation rate-- %$* 308
and, by the way, the federal rate is 56 percent because the ncaa has all sorts of gimmicks called its graduation success rate. %$* 308
buzz, buzz, this is landing well. %$* 13
i want to let him respond. %$* 13
i'll concede that instead of 55 it's 56, all right? %$* 310
as a-- %$* 308
take on the question. %$* 13
why-- %$* 13
he's talking about a great imbalance in disparity and where the investment goes. %$* 13
the money goes to where people pay for it. %$* 310
people want-- %$* 310
look, this is america. %$* 310
people want winners. %$* 310
they wanted the programs to win. %$* 310
and they'll pay for it. %$* 310
i agree with jason, the coaches should split some of that salary, create a stipend for the players. %$* 310
i'm in full agreement. %$* 310
again, look it, you guys can't just say, "well, football needs to change, there's bad things about it." yeah, there are. %$* 310
there are some things that are dangerous, that's unsettling. %$* 310
are we going to not allow-- %$* 310
no students should allowed to be driving motor vehicles. %$* 310
that is 100 times more dangerous. %$* 310
i want to ask buzz-- %$* 311
just one second. %$* 311
we have to protect our youth. %$* 310
i just have to go back. %$* 309
as a canadian, i have to go back to something you just said when you said that the merits-- %$* 309
yeah, but you guys don’t drive, do you? %$* 18
“this is america. %$* 309
we don’t ban things.” are you sure? %$* 309
you don’t ban things in america? %$* 309
do you want me to say this is north america? %$* 310
let me think. %$* 309
let’s think for a moment about something that we’ve banned recently in america. %$* 309
gay marriage, heard about it? %$* 309
we ban things all the time, tim. %$* 309
jason whitlock. %$* 13
it’s not banned in new york state and i think it will cease to be banned everywhere in this country. %$* 310
jason whitlock. %$* 13
buzz, i wanted to ask you, and i don’t know the answer to this. %$* 311
it’s certainly banned on football programs %$* 308
i would-- %$* 311
buzz-- %$* 311
don’t ask, don’t tell, buzz. %$* 310
would you-- %$* 311
buzz, would you agree that boobie probably required more support if he-- %$* 311
did he deserve an opportunity-- %$* 311
if he had been good enough to go onto college, would he not deserve perhaps a little more support academically to get through school? %$* 311
i mean, considering his background. %$* 311
and boobie was a great character in buzz’s “friday night lights” book. %$* 311
because-- %$* 308
would he have gotten more support? %$* 308
yes. %$* 308
no, would you say the kid deserved it, though? %$* 311
wouldn’t that be a good thing? %$* 311
if he effectively used it, sure, but i think they are given that support to pass them through and make sure that they are eligible-- %$* 308
having experienced-- %$* 311
and, jason, the graduation rates for african american players is-- %$* 308
complex reasons, buzz. %$* 311
complex reasons. %$* 311
terrible. %$* 311
but wait. %$* 311
let me just give you-- %$* 311
let’s talk facts. %$* 311
florida state. %$* 311
whites, 93 percent. %$* 311
blacks, 44 percent. %$* 311
arkansas, 80 percent-- %$* 311
buzz, if they broke it down-- %$* 311
let me finish. %$* 308
80 percent-- %$* 308
because i actually did the some work on this instead of %$* 308
two-parent home versus single-parent home, i bet you you’d erase the racial disparity. %$* 311
kids that come from two-parent homes, regardless of color, are more apt to graduate-- %$* 311
yeah, but let me-- %$* 308
from college than kids that come from single-parent homes. %$* 311
but you’re dismissing the-- %$* 308
it’s not a-- %$* 311
you’re-- %$* 308
it’s not necessarily a race issue. %$* 311
but you’re completely dismissing-- %$* 308
the foundation-- %$* 311
the racial disparity. %$* 308
you’re completely dismissing it. %$* 308
i’m not dismissing it. %$* 311
i’ve experienced it. %$* 311
you are you know that? %$* 308
let me just-- %$* 13
all right, all right. %$* 13
i’m going to-- %$* 310
i’m going hope-- %$* 13
tim. %$* 13
quickly throw-- %$* 310
tim green. %$* 13
two numbers at you. %$* 310
since 1984 the graduation for football players across the board has increased 10 percent. %$* 310
that’s a good thing. %$* 310
it’s a good trend. %$* 310
in the last 10 years. %$* 310
so that’s 25 years. %$* 310
in the last 10 years there has been a 15 percent increase in african american football players alone. %$* 310
so it’s not perfect, but guess what? %$* 310
against the general population, which is going down, the football players are going up. %$* 310
and maybe it does require a little bit more money to get them there with the tutors and the academic centers but they are earning it. %$* 310
they are paying for it with their efforts in practice and in the games on saturday afternoon. %$* 310
buzz, do you have something further to say on that-- %$* 13
do you have something to move that forward? %$* 13
because i think you’ve stated your case. %$* 13
i want to put a question to this side because there’s something about your argument that i realize i’m not clear on. %$* 13
do you believe that athletics have a place, a formal place, in education, period? %$* 13
in the same way, for example, that music, painting, performance may? %$* 13
do those things belong on campus? %$* 13
is athletics part of an education in the college level? %$* 13
absolutely. %$* 309
malcolm gladwell. %$* 13
for all-- %$* 309
how does it fit in, then? %$* 13
for all of the reasons i think that were so articulately stated by mr. %$* 309
green and mr. %$* 309
whitlock. %$* 309
they are opportunities to build character, to learn teamwork, to bring people from different backgrounds together. %$* 309
all of that’s true. %$* 309
so you’re saying it’s-- %$* 13
buzz, you’re saying it’s the way in which football is happening now? %$* 13
in other words, if you went back 50 years-- %$* 13
well, i mean, it’s the way-- %$* 308
no, because there is-- %$* 308
the myth of the student athlete is a myth. %$* 308
in the early 1900s, when the ivy league ruled football, you know what they did? %$* 308
they hired these kids, they gave them a shared of the gate receipts, they never went to school, and they were not expected to go to school. %$* 308
this is a myth propagated by people like grantland rice, who raise these players to biblical proportions and ronald reagan playing win one for the gipper. %$* 308
now, in 1950 the average sat score of an athlete was 18 points below the average student. %$* 308
it is now exponentially lower and i’m not sure-- %$* 308
and tim played. %$* 308
but what does football-- %$* 308
wait, wait, buzz, just-- %$* 13
i just want to finish up the-- %$* 13
sure. %$* 308
point that malcolm started. %$* 13
so where does athletics in general and football specifically fit into the process of education? %$* 13
football does not fit into the process of a college education, not when we rank 14th in the world-- %$* 308
but rowing does? %$* 13
rowing may to some degree. %$* 308
why? %$* 13
they could all be college sports. %$* 308
what’s the-- %$* 13
they could all be club sports. %$* 308
honestly, we are so athletic-obsessed, and for what? %$* 308
for what? %$* 308
i mean, the number of scholarships that we give out, does penn state really need 29 varsity sports? %$* 308
does it? %$* 308
is it right that the single biggest individual contribution given was $70 million for establishment of a division 1 hockey program at a time when tuition is going up? %$* 308
and i imagine a lot of those students are leaving because they can no longer afford school, unlike your football players. %$* 308
tim green. %$* 13
i just don't-- %$* 310
i honestly-- %$* 310
i don't understand why opportunities for student athletes makes you so angry. %$* 310
i don't. %$* 310
i don't understand why you begrudge college athletes scholarships, especially when part of your own argument is that these guys-- %$* 310
these football players and basketball players are being exploited because the revenues that they generate. %$* 310
those revenues that they generate are used to pay for-- %$* 310
you talked about the expenses that are there, the expenses, it's all part of the show. %$* 310
and they pay for it dearly. %$* 310
they work very hard and you do take risks. %$* 310
you don't take risks, you know, any more than a lot of other sports. %$* 310
you take less risks than riding a bicycle or driving a car, but you do take risks, and you put forth tremendous effort. %$* 310
and from those efforts, you should-- %$* 310
we're in agreement. %$* 310
you should get something back. %$* 310
so which one is it, buzz? %$* 310
i mean, do you want-- %$* 310
do you want players to-- %$* 310
football players to have the opportunities of education as compensation for their efforts or don't you? %$* 310
you're mixing messages. %$* 310
all right. %$* 13
i want to go to questions from the audience, but first i want to tell you, so we are now in the question and audience section of this intelligence squared u.s. debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan of intelligence squared u.s.we have four debaters, two teams of two, debating this motion: "ban college football." and how this will work, if you raise your hand, i'll call on you. %$* 13
just wait till a microphone comes to you. %$* 13
and you're being filmed too, so please stand up so that we can see you. %$* 13
hold the microphone about a fist's distance from your mouth so that it can hear you clearly. %$* 13
we'd appreciate it if you could state your name, if you're a member of the media or a blogger, we'd appreciate that. %$* 13
and i really urge you to make your question a question, and you'll recognize it as such because a question mark naturally goes at the end of it. %$* 13
and try to keep it on topic. %$* 13
you know, there's a lot of places we could go with this. %$* 13
we really want the question to get these guys talking about in a way that helps you make your decision on whether to ban college football or not to. %$* 13
sir in the far back, you're wearing a black sweater with horizontal white stripes. %$* 13
i can't see you, by the way, if you're not in the lit area. %$* 13
so if you can't see the hands on your wristwatch, i can't see you. %$* 13
but if you want to come down forward to the lit area, then i might be able to call on you. %$* 13
sir, go ahead. %$* 13
yes. %$* 312
my name is rick levy. %$* 312
i'm not a member of the media, but i do have a question regarding the health of a football player. %$* 312
with the exposure in the new orleans saints for pay for injuring players, is this, in your experience, happening in college as well? %$* 312
are college players being rewarded for injuring their opponents? %$* 312
which brings us to the large area of corruption which we haven't discussed greatly. %$* 13
which side would like to take that first? %$* 13
because we can take it to either side. %$* 13
buzz bissinger? %$* 13
well, i don't-- %$* 308
i would think not. %$* 308
i mean, i would think not. %$* 308
but you know, if you want to talk corruption, if you want to talk academic cheating, the numbers-- %$* 308
let's-- %$* 310
let's answer the question first. %$* 310
no, but corruption in college sports. %$* 308
no, but he-- %$* 310
let's answer his question. %$* 310
i said i don't think-- %$* 308
okay. %$* 310
that any coach or player, there is a bounty system-- %$* 308
right. %$* 310
for any college program. %$* 308
however-- %$* 308
and-- %$* 13
and before that, tim green. %$* 13
unlike everything else, you're right. %$* 310
let's go to teams on probation. %$* 308
wait. %$* 310
let me just-- %$* 310
let me just answer. %$* 310
let me answer his question, because i do-- %$* 310
buzz, i will come back to you. %$* 13
i do happen to know that. %$* 310
in the national football league, what happened with the new orleans saints was an aberration. %$* 310
in my eight years of playing in the nfl, in my 10 years as a broadcaster for fox sports and knowing players intimately throughout the league, i never heard of anything quite like it, neither did anyone else. %$* 310
by the way, people knew about what was happening with the new orleans saints for the past three years. %$* 310
and they were warned over and over again, "we hear this. %$* 310
you guys better stop. %$* 310
this is absolutely crazy." it's crazy. %$* 310
it's wrong. %$* 310
it was despicable. %$* 310
it's an aberration. %$* 310
it doesn't happen in pro football, other places, and it certainly has no place, and it has not happened to my knowledge in the college %$* 310
okay. %$* 13
now you know if anybody wants to stand up and say, "buzz, what about corruption? %$* 13
" he's ready to go. %$* 13
so-- %$* 13
no, but i thought we-- %$* 308
go ahead. %$* 13
go ahead, buzz. %$* 13
i thought what tim said, who was in a position to know the best was both eloquent and right and reassuring. %$* 308
tim played pro football. %$* 308
i completely disagree with him. %$* 18
malcolm gladwell. %$* 13
however-- %$* 308
however, let's talk about teams on probation since 2009. georgia tech, lsu, michigan, unc, alabama, ohio state, new mexico, usc, florida international, alabama state, west virginia, boise state, hobart-- %$* 308
what the f-- %$* 308
i didn't do it! %$* 308
i didn't do it. %$* 308
nebraska, tennessee. %$* 308
how many is that? %$* 308
i know you'll say that's anecdotal. %$* 308
academic cheating, florida state, 61 players took online courses where they received answers beforehand or did no work. %$* 308
the team had to vacate wins during those seasons. %$* 308
unc which has been invoked, all these football players for some reason were taking-- %$* 308

i think that illustrates my point, which is, in fact, the proposition is correct. %$* 306
freedom of the press does give way before state secrets. %$* 306
and the reason that we can accept that proposition is because we have built a structure that actually is quite protective even within the terms of that proposition. %$* 306
the reason that there haven't been prosecutions of journalists is because people weigh what will happen in a courtroom with a judge and a jury. %$* 306
and so when you do your job in a close case, if you feel you're acting in good faith, you can have a reasonably high degree of confidence that if it doesn't wind up in a prosecution, you can go to court, and you're going to wind up prevailing in front of a judge and a jury. %$* 306
and that's the worst possible result because what it says-- %$* 305
alan dershowitz. %$* 13
is if the new york times, if you're seymour hersh, if you're bob woodward, you have nothing to worry about. %$* 305
but if you're julian assange, and you're not working under the supervision of the government, if you're not somebody who has a constant relationship with the government, you have plenty to worry about. %$* 305
it gives the government far too much discretion to go after people who reveal information that is not something they want revealed. %$* 305
and i think, frankly, you're asking the wrong question. %$* 305
can he do the job? %$* 305
that's a terrible criteria under the first amendment. %$* 305
we can change it and say, could we have literature without there being sex? %$* 305
of course we can. %$* 305
we can have shakespeare. %$* 305
but that's never been the criteria under the first amendment. %$* 305
can you do your job? %$* 305
that shifts the presumption and the burden to the press to justify that it can do its job. %$* 305
the answer is, is there a constraint, a lawful and-- %$* 305
constraint on the way the press does its job, and i think the answer to that is there's far too much discretion in the government to decide who to go after for leaking and who not to, and that's very dangerous. %$* 305
and actually i think alan-- %$* 306
gabriel-- %$* 13
let's let gabriel %$* 13
it may be dangerous for leakers but it certainly-- %$* 304
the historical record is not one of danger for the press. %$* 304
there's never been a successful prosecution of journalists as david sanger just noted. %$* 304
and the one case, i'm wondering what you think about it, that where there was-- %$* 304
a prosecution was initiated, the chicago tribune case in world war ii where the government-- %$* 304
where the chicago tribune published a front page story strongly suggesting that we had broken the japanese naval codes, a leak that could have cost the lives of tens of thousands of u.s.servicemen. %$* 304
now, there are plenty of people, journalists who think that there shouldn't-- %$* 304
that there shouldn't have been a prosecution, but, i mean, that seems to me almost madness. %$* 304
well, first of all there have been many, many prosecutions not under that particular statute but you've heard about shouting "fire" in the crowded theater. %$* 305
do you know what the facts were of that case? %$* 305
there was a guy who was handing out leaflets in front of a draft board, telling people to consider whether or not they might have a constitutional right to be a conscientious objector. %$* 305
and oliver wendell holmes, in the worst analogy ever constructed by the legal mind-- %$* 305
turned that into shouting fire in a crowded theater. %$* 305
the analogy was handing out a leaflet outside of a burning theater, saying, “please don't go in there, it might be unsafe to you,” and he turns out to be wrong. %$* 305
gabriel schoenfeld. %$* 13
you’re changing the subject, we're talking here about a disclosure that could have cost the lives if tens of thousands of people, should the government go after a newspaper in a case like that or in a case like the swift case where real-time operational intelligence is jeopardized about people who are trying to blow up our subways. %$* 304
well, you know-- %$* 307
wait, let's-- %$* 13
david sanger. %$* 13
let’s take gabe’s question right on because these are decisions we have to make every day. %$* 307
during the run up to the iraq war, the bush administration said repeatedly that they had made no decision and had no plans to invade iraq. %$* 307
the new york times discovered over the july 4th holiday in 2002 that there was a very detailed plan to invade iraq. %$* 307
and it published that fact with just enough detail to make it clear that in fact the bush administration had put together a plan, but not quite enough detail to actually tell saddam hussein what that plan looked like. %$* 307
now, there were many in the bush administration at that time who were calling for the prosecution of the new york times. %$* 307
i think the new york times served an enormously important public interest there by making it clear to the public that no matter what government officials were saying in public to them, in fact they had a plan based on what we now know was fairly loose evidence, to invade a foreign country. %$* 307
but isn’t-- %$* 306
michael chertoff. %$* 13
but doesn't that actually illustrate the point we've been making, that the restrictions in place do allow a judgment to be made about whether something will cross the line or not because-- %$* 306
we sure didn't know that at the time. %$* 307
well, sure, you did because you were able to predict that you have-- %$* 306
you know what the track record of the law is, you know that if a decision is made to prosecute, you're going to have a jury and a judge and you'll be able to make an appeal to them, and all of those allow you some freedom of movement, but not absolute freedom of movement. %$* 306
the flipside of it is to go back to the bin laden case and maybe the times wouldn't have published it, but there might be other news organs that would, if a news organ had gotten a hold of the plan to put seals into abbottabad and they had been able to consider publishing that without any fear of being prosecuted or being enjoined, with absolute impunity, would that be where we want to see the united states? %$* 306
i suggest if you go back to the very quote that gabriel made earlier about the constitution not being a suicide pact, giving that absolute protection would be devastating for the united states. %$* 306
i think there's an answer to that. %$* 305
alan dershowitz. %$* 13
if a newspaper learned about the fact that the seals were preparing to attack bin laden, then that attack should have been aborted. %$* 305
you haven't been keeping your secrets well enough. %$* 305
you can't depend on a newspaper's discretion to put the lives of brave american seals at risk. %$* 305
so if you find out that a newspaper has that report, you have to abort. %$* 305
sometimes %$* 305
are you saying, alan, that the newspaper would have a duty to print that %$* 18
well, let me give you a story. %$* 305
jimmy reston didn't print the story of the bay of pigs invasion because he wanted to protect americans and cubans. %$* 305
the bay of pigs invasion was a disaster for america and a disaster for cuban patriots. %$* 305
and what did president kennedy say to them later? %$* 18
i wish you had printed it. %$* 18
and if the times had printed that, we might have averted a disaster. %$* 305
you don't know in advance. %$* 305
look, the seals thing might have gone wrong. %$* 305
by that logic-- %$* 304
gabriel schoenfeld. %$* 13
and by that logic, professor dershowitz, the times should have published, if it had known in advance, that we were about to make the raid on bin laden. %$* 304
if-- %$* 18
because it could have gotten wrong. %$* 304
and then we would have to abort the operation? %$* 304
if in fact the times learned that it was a bad plan and that it was an illegal plan, and they decided to publish it, and we had to abort it, that would be a very, very good example of the interplay between-- %$* 305
no, it would be-- %$* 306
the press and the executive. %$* 305
an example-- %$* 306
michael chertoff. %$* 13
i don't think-- %$* 305
alan, let michael-- %$* 13
let michael get to that point. %$* 13
michael chertoff. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
i think it would be an example of taking away from the three branches of government the authority to make decisions about securing the united states, which was, in many ways, the reason the constitution was formed-- %$* 306
was to make this effective and to hand it over to the press. %$* 306
and not probably just the new york times. %$* 306
it could be any organ of the press. %$* 306
and the last point i have to make on this is that the press is so concerned about the possibility of chilling because an injunction or prosecution for leaking national security secrets. %$* 306
if you take copyrighted material from another news organ, and you publish it without permission, you can be sued, you can be prosecuted. %$* 306
not for the ideas, only for the words. %$* 305
right. %$* 306
exactly. %$* 306
okay. %$* 305
that's different. %$* 305
does that-- %$* 306
and that happens from time to time-- %$* 306
does that cause the times to enter into a state of paralytic hysteria? %$* 306
i think you're missing-- %$* 305
briefly, i think you're missing my point. %$* 305
they live with that threat of being %$* 306
my point about-- %$* 305
about the osama bin laden is that the times had learned about it. %$* 305
that would mean there is a real possibility that others would know about it. %$* 305
and that's an important decision for the government to know about. %$* 305
it's like the canary and the coal mine, i assume? %$* 13
right. %$* 305
well, no. %$* 305
it's-- %$* 305
you know, the risk-- %$* 305
the government shouldn't let the new york times find out about secrets like that. %$* 305
we have %$* 18
let's talk about how this would actually have played out. %$* 304
hundreds of people are involved in a military operation like that. %$* 304
yeah. %$* 18
thousands of people are involved-- %$* 304
right. %$* 18
in other secrets. %$* 304
2.5 million americans hold security clearances. %$* 304
eight hundred thousand of them-- %$* 304
that's the problem. %$* 305
hold top secret clearances. %$* 304
with populations of that size, you're going to have people who disagree with the government, people who might be deranged, people who are going to leak secrets. %$* 304
we cannot-- %$* 304
how many people do you think knew about the osama bin laden raid? %$* 305
let's go back to the-- %$* 18
all right. %$* 13
all right, david sanger. %$* 13
david sanger, new york times. %$* 13
dozens-- %$* 307
maybe hundreds knew about it. %$* 307
it didn't leak, and i'm very glad that it didn't. %$* 307
and the new york times didn't have to make that decision. %$* 307
right. %$* 18
how would this have played out in real life? %$* 307
i suspect with the new york times, for all the reasons i've laid out before, would not have published that fact. %$* 307
but when the phone call was made to the white house to say, “we have heard this,” my guess is that what would have played out is exactly what alan suggested. %$* 307
the operation probably would have been aborted, just for the fact that we made that phone call. %$* 307
and that tells you a little bit about how the system works in reality. %$* 307
well, you're surely not going to argue, david, that the purpose of giving the press immunity is to allow them to play a kind of red teaming on government operations. %$* 306
certainly not. %$* 307
because for example, with swift, swift was working perfectly well until we %$* 306
michael, just two sentences reminding people of what swift was. %$* 13
swift was the program that allowed the u.s.government to track the flow of money to terrorists on a global basis, which was exactly what the 9/11 commission recommended. %$* 306
and it was a very useful and important program. %$* 306
and it wasn't failing. %$* 306
and the revelation of the program ultimately led to it becoming much less effective. %$* 306
and there-- %$* 13
were there issues of illegality of any kind? %$* 13
and no issues of illegalities, the times itself conceded. %$* 306
so there was a minimal public interest. %$* 306
this wasn't exposing criminality. %$* 306
what about the plans for weaponizing anthrax or for coming up with biological weapons? %$* 306
would you take the argument that if we publicize those plans, that shows that the information is out there, therefore let's disseminate it widely so people can begin to cook up bacterial anthrax in their garage? %$* 306
i think the logic in this refutes itself. %$* 306
okay. %$* 13
wait, we have to take a break. %$* 13
and when we come back, we'll take questions from the audience. %$* 13
welcome back. %$* 13
we're an intelligence squared debate from-- %$* 13
let me do that again. %$* 13
can you give me another round of applause, because i-- %$* 13
we're back to this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
our motion is “freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets.” debating for the motion, in support of the motion, gabriel schoenfeld and michael chertoff. %$* 13
against, alan dershowitz and david sanger. %$* 13
and i'd like now to go to our audience to ask questions that will move this debate along on the topic itself, which once again is “freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets.” and if you just raise your hand, there's a woman in a black dress? %$* 13
if you can hold it about that-- %$* 13
that's perfect. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
so, is the against side saying that the press should never be prosecuted for any publishing of state secrets-- %$* 19
any state secrets? %$* 19
is that the position? %$* 19
that was a question the question, yes. %$* 13
david sanger. %$* 13
as a reporter, i would hope-- %$* 307
i would hope the prosecution wouldn't happen. %$* 307
but the reality is that you have to establish a system in which the secrets that america is protecting are real secrets, like the bin laden example that we were using before. %$* 307
but instead, we live in a system in which there are millions of pages classified each and every day. %$* 307
and you can't have a press that is living forever in the fear that the publication of any piece of data could lead to an equivalent prosecutorial discretion on this issue. %$* 307
and so if you're going to truly not devalue the point of the realm, if you're going to say there are some things that the united states really needs to protect, it's got to be a very, very narrow list. %$* 307
and that is not where the u.s.government is going. %$* 307
in fact, the amount of classified data expands dramatically every single year. %$* 307
michael chertoff. %$* 13
well, i think the answer to the question then was, essentially as the question you're asked, you can see that there obviously are occasions when the press should be prosecuted for publication. %$* 306
for publication of-- %$* 305
of state secrets. %$* 306
and the issue then becomes-- %$* 306
or some state secrets. %$* 305
and the argument that david makes is, but the problem is it's too hard because there's too much classified material. %$* 306
and yet the facts show that when it comes time to make the decision to prosecute, government historically, whether it be republicans or democrats, have been very, very conservative and cautious in actually prosecuting. %$* 306
and that tells me the system works, that in fact the government doesn't overreach on prosecution and that it is possible to have a workable system where people who are responsible journalists know where they can't go, like the bin laden case, and the irresponsible ones, dare i say assange, may find themselves in a different-- %$* 306
and who decides who's responsible and irresponsible on the basis of what criteria? %$* 305
the issue is whether or not somebody should be punished for publishing state secrets. %$* 305
the answer to that is clearly no, not for publishing state secrets. %$* 305
if you want to have a list of things that can be published, that's a very different criteria. %$* 305
you yourself conceded all three branches of government have to be involved. %$* 305
at the moment, the legislative branch hasn't been involved. %$* 305
they have punted. %$* 305
they have simply said, broadly defined state secrets, the espionage act. %$* 305
that has to be scrapped. %$* 305
and if you want to have six, nine, four specific categories of things that can't be published, that's an interesting debate, and i think both of us would acknowledge. %$* 305
but not to punish people for violating state secrets - - %$* 305
gabriel schoenfeld. %$* 13
that sounds like other countries which have-- %$* 305
come in, gabriel. %$* 13
the legislature-- %$* 304
the legislature has not punted. %$* 304
we do have highly specific laws on the books. %$* 304
the direct question was put to you, mr. %$* 304
sanger, would you prosecute-- %$* 304
should the press be prosecuted when it violates those sanctions, when it violates those particular statutes? %$* 304
if the press publishes, for example, the identities of an intelligence agent, cia agent, do you believe that the press should be prosecuted? %$* 304
if the press publishes designs of nuclear weapons, as the progressives tried to do in 1979, is there a basis for prosecution? %$* 304
there may well be a basis for prosecution. %$* 307
but the judgment for doing that runs a much greater risk, which is the chilling effect risk. %$* 307
and there are certainly a very limited number of things for which i could imagine why the u.s.government would get in and truly seek to prosecute. %$* 307
the fact that they haven't tells you that they seem to know already that this is an unsustainable legal regime for the very reasons that alan has laid out, that there is nothing in the law that distinguishes between that very narrow group of true state secrets which we can all put a list together and probably the list you could count on both hands. %$* 307
and that vast majority of material that is covered under those very laws you described. %$* 307
can i ask a question of you? %$* 305
would you be prepared to abolish the espionage act of 1917 with its broad characterizations and just limit prosecution to those particular statutes that you talked about, naming spies, naming intelligence? %$* 305
then we have an interesting debate. %$* 305
the problem is the current statutory criterias, the worst of all possible worlds, it gives enormous discretion, and it gives the very government whose secrets are being released, the discretion and the power to decide not to go after the new york times, they like them-- %$* 305
michael chertoff, do you want to answer the question? %$* 13
but to go after assange, they don't like him. %$* 18
again, i mean, i hate to say it. %$* 306
i think that gives the whole game away. %$* 306
so if we agreed that the identities protection act, if we agree the communications and cryptographic act which are very specific-- %$* 306
right. %$* 305
that those appropriate, that prosecutions are appropriate. %$* 306
then i think you've conceded that in fact state secrets ought to be sufficient to make the - - %$* 306
let's go to another question from the audience. %$* 13
right in the center there. %$* 13
yep. %$* 13
we did that. %$* 13
that's you. %$* 13
is the for side basically saying that the statement is correct that needs a big caveat of a wise judiciary system? %$* 19
no. %$* 306
i think what the for side is saying is that the statement is correct in the context of the government system in which we operate. %$* 306
that's why saying, well, you know, this is-- %$* 306
we don't want to become like egypt or russia, that's not the context in which the proposition is offered. %$* 306
the proposition is offered in the context of our current system of government in which part of the protection for the press is not just, quote, "freedom of the press in the first amendment." but it is the structure of government that says if you actually want to take the step of prosecution, you've got to have an executive decision to prosecute. %$* 306
you've got to judge who will consider alan dershowitz's arguments about whether the law is properly written, and you'll have a jury of 12 people like you who will make the final decision. %$* 306
and in that context the proposition, i think, makes the unassailable point that freedom of the press has to be balanced against and in some instances give way to state secrets. %$* 306
and the worst possible solution is to give-- %$* 305
alan dershowitz. %$* 13
the very same government that is being offended the power to make that decision. %$* 305
and if you think you can count on juries, just remember how juries operated during the mccarthy period. %$* 305
remember how juries operate during times of crisis. %$* 305
the first amendment was built to protect the most unpopular, the most hated during the worst periods of our history. %$* 305
and discretion is not going to serve that protection. %$* 305
gabriel schoenfeld. %$* 13
solid laws. %$* 305
we need-- %$* 305
let me give you the-- %$* 305
no, no, no. %$* 13
let-- %$* 13
no, no. %$* 13
gabriel-- %$* 13
gabriel schoenfeld. %$* 13
gabriel schoenfeld, please. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
i have the microphone. %$* 304
i have the microphone. %$* 304
even if we take your suggestion, and scrap the espionage act, which i would have trouble trusting the current congress to do a better job than the one that wrote it in 1917-- %$* 304
they couldn't do a worse job. %$* 305
but even if we did that, and we had a new set of laws that somehow managed to enumerate the very complex set of things that have to be protected. %$* 304
it's not just a little list of six, by the way. %$* 304
you still-- %$* 304
if you had new laws, you'd still have juries, and you'd still have prosecutors using their discretion. %$* 304
that's built into our system. %$* 304
it's not a perfect system. %$* 304
name a better one. %$* 304
let me tell you. %$* 305
let me name a better one. %$* 305
we should have a rule that says you cannot, under any circumstances, publish the name of spies. %$* 305
and if the new york times does it, they must be prosecuted. %$* 305
if wikileaks does it, they must be prosecuted. %$* 305
no room for discretion. %$* 305
david, do you want those rules? %$* 13
no prosecutorial discretion, period. %$* 305
david sanger, do you want those sorts of rules? %$* 13
i'm sorry? %$* 307
would you want those sorts of rules spelled out so clearly? %$* 13
i wouldn’t be happy with specific rules because i know that as situations evolve, you're going to discover that that list is going to leave both sides unsatisfied. %$* 307
that's why we're dealing with an espionage act that was written in 1917 that we don't think fits the modern world. %$* 307
but it would certainly be better to have a very narrow list like that than what we are living with today. %$* 307
because what we're living with today would allow the government of the united states under extreme circumstances, and i'm not saying it would happen in the current political environment, but you've got to think when you do this about a political environment into the future, in which they could prosecute for almost anything that you read in the national security coverage pages of the new york times in each and every day. %$* 307
and when the law is written that broadly, it simply becomes devalued over time. %$* 307
but as you have said, the government tends not to prosecute. %$* 13
fortunately, the government so far does tend not to prosecute. %$* 307
so you cannot-- %$* 307
you can't count on that, and that's-- %$* 307
it's a very high hurdle. %$* 304
it's a very high hurdle prosecuting a journalist under the espionage act. %$* 304
and they have to show bad faith on the part of the journalist, intent to injure the united states. %$* 304
no, no, no, no. %$* 18
that's-- %$* 304
wait. %$* 304
let me, let me finish. %$* 304
but i want to just return back to this question of the raid on osama bin laden. %$* 304
which you say the times would not have printed if it had known in advance, would not have wanted to jeopardize that example that the american forces. %$* 304
but just a few minutes before that, you were saying you were applauding the fact that the times should have published in advance the bay of pigs operation. %$* 304
which is it? %$* 304
it's a very-- %$* 307
a very basic answer to that question. %$* 307
the times did not publish the bay of pigs operation. %$* 307
and what happened was the president of the united states turned around later on and said, “gee, i wish you would have.” the times has not published many other operational cases like that. %$* 307
is that always a good judgment? %$* 307
not necessarily. %$* 307
the-- %$* 307
the problem that we're dealing with here is that mistakes are going to be made on both sides, and the question is where do we want the law to weigh the errors? %$* 307
and the answer to my mind is we want to err on the side of disclosure. %$* 307
that's what the first amendment is all about. %$* 307
you don't want to err on the side of %$* 18
if you could stand up just-- %$* 13
yeah, right there, that's right, thank you. %$* 13
it seems to me that part of this argument is coming down to sort of, you know, if there is discretion, then there almost inevitably will be discrimination, sort of if there is discretion then it's hard to say even what the law is. %$* 18
i'm confused by this sort of hard line rule that you guys seem to be going over, this idea that disclosing the name of cia agents is somehow maybe something that should be absolutely prohibited. %$* 18
but should it be prohibited even when the name is revealed by an employee of the white house? %$* 18
you know-- %$* 18
and on to dershowitz, i'm sorry, i don't think the rule could be that firm, but on the other hand then there's this question of what is a secret? %$* 18
after a white house employee has leaked the secret, is it still a secret? %$* 18
you said that-- %$* 18
okay, all right, michael chertoff, that's a great question actually-- %$* 13
and i think that illustrates exactly why i think the current system works not perfectly but as well as you can have in human existence. %$* 306
the current system as you point out in the question recognizes that there's never an absolute. %$* 306
there are probably some times that you could reveal the identity of an agent when it's out there already, and you could argue that there's really no impact. %$* 306
there are other times when you're reviewing other kinds of information that would be terribly devastating or damaging, again, recipes for certain kinds of weapons or for the revelation of certain kinds of operational plans. %$* 306
and the key is in all of these situations what we do is we have a system for resolving a prosecution because we involve people like sitting in this room and 12 jurors in the box, and that is the protection that we have that in the end the law will be applied reasonably and a reasonable application of the law is the best defense. %$* 306
a rigid application is one which is likely to wind up with exactly the kind of conundrum %$* 306
well, here we really have a difference because i think you need %$* 305
alan dershowitz. %$* 13
rigid application when it comes to the first amendment. %$* 305
the first amendment says, no, juries don't get to decide that because juries and the people like to ban things when they’re very, very unpopular. %$* 305
the constitution prohibits that, just like the constitution prohibits discrimination against the most absurd of all religions. %$* 305
and we can't have that kind of discretion. %$* 305
the rule has to be items can't be published, the names, that might be too broad or too narrow, if the times publishes it, they can be prosecuted. %$* 305
if the white house publishes it, they can be prosecuted. %$* 305
and if wikileaks publishes it, they can be prosecuted. %$* 305
the same law has to apply to all. %$* 305
you're saying nobody is in danger because there is no prosecution. %$* 305
there is currently in virginia a grand jury investigation directed against wikileaks and directed against assange, not against the new york times. %$* 305
but isn't that a great example-- %$* 306
and the defense is going to be essentially-- %$* 305
isn't that a great-- %$* 306
the times published this, too. %$* 305
you're not going after them. %$* 305
oh, no, you don’t go after the times, we go after wikileaks because they don’t have the power-- %$* 305
okay, michael chertoff. %$* 13
alan, isn't that a great example-- %$* 306
i didn't want to bring up the wikileaks, but since you have i will. %$* 306
sure. %$* 305
isn't that a great example of the fact that attributing ill motive to juries or to prosecutors or to the government omits the fact that there can be ill motive on the publisher? %$* 306
in the case of assange, it's reported that his purpose in leaking the information as he told his associates is because he wants to make it impossible for the u.s.government to function by making it impossible for secrets to be held, so that people can’t have conversations. %$* 306
so he's motivated by ill will to the united states. %$* 306
now, is this the man we want to trust if god forbid he got a hold of the bin laden attack plan, do we want to trust him to exercise his judgment? %$* 306
and do we want to trust-- %$* 305
or would we rather trust people like those in this room? %$* 306
no, do we want to prosecute-- %$* 305
or do we want to trust the prosecutor who misstates what assange said and what his motive was, because he doesn't like assange? %$* 305
"assange, i don't like, we're going to go after him. %$* 305
times i like, we're going to go after him." if you leave this to motive analysis, do we know what the motive of the new york times is? %$* 305
is it to sell advertising? %$* 305
is it to be powerful? %$* 305
is it to help the government? %$* 305
a motive analysis, to be limiting freedom of the press would mean the end of the first amendment. %$* 305
okay, we're going to take a break. %$* 13
our motion is "freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets." we'll be back with this intelligence squared u.s.debate in just a moment. %$* 13
okay, we are back. %$* 13
our motion is "freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets." i jumped the gun. %$* 13
we are back at this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
our motion is "freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets." we're taking questions from the audience. %$* 13
sir, could you stand? %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
sure. %$* 18
first of all, thank you very much for being here. %$* 18
obviously this is not a debate of absolutes-- %$* 18
it seems that the point of discretion keeps coming up over and over again. %$* 18
so, framing the debate in discretion is a question of who do you really trust? %$* 18
when there can be abuses on both sides, who has the most information to make that decision? %$* 18
the press is a very broad category, ranging from very established newspapers to bloggers. %$* 18
so with all possibilities of abuse with government-- %$* 18
cover-ups, perhaps, or misinformation and trouble with information flow-- %$* 18
who has the most information to make the decision and where is the greater risk? %$* 18
as much as i love the first amendment, i’d like to pose the question. %$* 18
david sanger. %$* 13
well, i think-- %$* 306
michael, let me let david take that first-- %$* 13
oh, sorry. %$* 306
and then i'll come to you. %$* 13
clearly, as any government official will happily tell you, they've got a wider range of information than the newspapers do. %$* 307
the reporter may be looking at a single document. %$* 307
wikileaks was the great exception-- %$* 307
it was 250,000 documents and four million words - - but usually, leaks are in dribs and drabs. %$* 307
and the government would make the argument that they are in a much better position to judge. %$* 307
that would be a very convincing argument, if in fact, the government, when doing its classification, had to do in a serious, credible way, a measure between security risk and public's right to know. %$* 307
but the fact of the matter is-- %$* 307
as someone in the cia said to me just last week-- %$* 307
no one ever got fired for stamping “classified” on a piece of paper. %$* 307
you know-- %$* 306
michael chertoff. %$* 13
i would say the question you're-- %$* 306
i'd like to actually suggest you come up and-- %$* 306
he's done a very good job of succinctly stating, i think the case for the proposition. %$* 306
in the end, there is going to be mistake and error and potentially ill will on both sides. %$* 306
what dave is arguing is that because the initial process of classifying is less than perfect and can be overbroad, that means that we have to throw the whole system out and the press has to have, essentially, free run. %$* 306
my argument is that instead of looking at only one part of the process, let's look at the whole process. %$* 306
if we come to the point of a prosecution, it's not just going to be the person who classified who is going to be part of that decision. %$* 306
it's not just going to be the prosecutor. %$* 306
in the end, it's going to have to be presented to a judge and a jury. %$* 306
there will be multiple of layers who have the opportunity to bring their judgment to bear on whether the decision to publish was right or violated the law. %$* 306
and that to me is the greatest protection of all. %$* 306
and-- %$* 306
because i have faith in the public and the courts and the entire process, i would rather trust that than julian assange to make that decision. %$* 306
another question from the audience. %$* 13
i'll let you take this one, al. %$* 13
sir, yeah. %$* 13
you just did that. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
yes. %$* 13
that's right. %$* 13
i must say, the remark you made about if the press had got to know about the bin laden, they could have the decision whether it was a good plan or bad plan, and then published it-- %$* 18
and then they would have to abandon the whole plan, i found that a little bit frightening, because like was made obvious just now, who has more information about that plan? %$* 18
i would think it was more-- %$* 18
but, sir, what would be your question to this %$* 13
the question i-- %$* 18
why are they wrong? %$* 13
yeah. %$* 18
the question i wanted to ask is is this not more about-- %$* 18
not just state secrets but state security that we entrust the press with? %$* 18
when you hear-- %$* 18
when you read statements in the press about how vulnerable the new york underground is to terrorism, how vulnerable our water supplies are, do you not think that you're giving away-- %$* 18
are you saying this discussion in the press is making the world more dangerous for us? %$* 13
yes. %$* 18
is that your question? %$* 13
definitely. %$* 18
that’s the question. %$* 13
i'll let david take it, then you. %$* 13
no, actually i told you you'd go next. %$* 13
alan dershowitz. %$* 13
well, i want to know if our water supply is vulnerable. %$* 305
i want to know if our infrastructure is vulnerable. %$* 305
i suspect there are enemies who already know that, and the issue about-- %$* 305
i think there's a lot of misunderstanding about what i said about the bin laden raid-- %$* 305
i supported the bin laden raid. %$* 305
i think it was legal. %$* 305
i think it was legitimate. %$* 305
i think we did a good job. %$* 305
i think we did a terrible job right after it in what information we revealed and what information we withheld. %$* 305
my only point was, if the united states government can't keep a secret like that, and if the new york times learns about it, or hezbollah learns about it, the press learns about it-- %$* 305
we have to really, seriously think about whether this is an operation you want to have go forward. %$* 305
what worries me most is the attitude i've heard from some of the questions-- %$* 305
the government knows more than we know. %$* 305
we, the government, know better. %$* 305
you hear that from every tyrannical regime in the world. %$* 305
the government knows better. %$* 305
we live in a system where the government has to be checked by the press, where the press is checked by the government, where we have confusion, uncertainty, we have no ability to really know in advance how it will come out. %$* 305
we don't know whether it would be a good thing or a bad thing. %$* 305
in retrospect, it was a good thing that bin laden was killed and that the press didn't reveal it. %$* 305
it might have come out differently. %$* 305
we don't know. %$* 305
what we need are rules. %$* 305
and the rules that we have now-- %$* 305
david-- %$* 13
alan, you have made that point, and i want to get to what this man's question was to david. %$* 13
does this sort of thing make the world more dangerous for us? %$* 13
this discussion-- %$* 13
he was talking more broadly about security. %$* 13
everybody might figure out that the subways are vulnerable. %$* 13
sure. %$* 307
but he's asking, i think, whether the broad discussion and the divulging of secrets makes the world more dangerous. %$* 13
and my answer to that would be, in many cases, it makes the world significantly safer, because the government is feeling some pressure, the u.s.government, to take a system that they may not have focused on entirely well and actually make it better. %$* 307
let me give you an example that comes right from mr. %$* 307
chertoff's time when he was at homeland security. %$* 307
president bush would frequently laud the fact that imports into the united states go through nuclear detectors that were put at every port. %$* 307
and everyone knew, including many of the importers, that these nuclear detectors did not deal well with anything that was shielded. %$* 307
in other words, you could put through a lot of different material through the port of los angeles, and these detectors were frequently set off by kitchen tables, by chinese toilets. %$* 307
nuclear weapons, that was another issue. %$* 307
now, at some point, many newspapers got around to writing about that. %$* 307
did we put the united states at greater danger? %$* 307
no. %$* 307
i think in fact what we did was prod the u.s. government to move faster with the technology it needed to go get in place. %$* 307
michael chertoff. %$* 13
but actually, that illustrates my point because factually, david, what actually happened was i testified about the fact that these were-- %$* 306
eventually, you did, yes. %$* 307
not eventually, up front. %$* 306
and that's the point, to answer the question. %$* 306
the government often itself will reveal, in a general sense, what the limitations are. %$* 306
in the case of these devices, it was that shielded material could not be detected. %$* 306
you had to add an additional device. %$* 306
where i think there is a greater danger is if you get to a certain level of specificity. %$* 306
for example, if you want to talk about general vulnerability in the new york subway system, you can argue that that's not harmful. %$* 306
it's even helpful. %$* 306
if you want to say there's a particular location where a bomb would cause a crippling devastating blow to the operation of the system, that, i think, would make us unsafe, and that should be a state secret. %$* 306

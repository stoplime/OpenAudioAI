thank you, kenji yoshino. %$* 13
and that concludes round one of this intelligence squared u.s.debate where our motion is "the equal protection clause does not require states to license same-sex marriages."now we move on to round two. %$* 13
and round two is where the debaters address one another directly and take questions from me and from you, our live audience here in philadelphia. %$* 13
our motion is "the equal protection clause does not require states to license same-sex marriages." arguing in support of this motion, we've heard from john eastman and sherif girgis. %$* 13
they have argued that the constitution does not actually settle this issue. %$* 13
it is not explicit at all, but they argue that the traditional vision of marriage, which they use the term "conjugal," that that vision has historical roots that need to be respected, that in fact the equal protection clause is only to be summoned in situations, very rare instances when majority rule needs to be asserted, but that this is not one of those cases. %$* 13
they also make the point that, repeatedly, when the court has addressed the issue of marriages of fundamental right, it has made it clear that the court, in the court's opinion, that is marriage between one man and one woman. %$* 13
arguing against them, we have heard from evan wolfson and kenji yoshino. %$* 13
they argue that, look, it's very simple. %$* 13
the freedom to marry is the freedom to marry. %$* 13
they site the fact that there are 60 percent support in polls for single sex marriage and argue that given historical disadvantage of gay people, that only willful blindness would allow the perception that same-sex marriage is not constitutionally protected. %$* 13
and they go back into history to the time in 1868 when the equal protection clause was written into the 14th amendment, pointing out that they believe that it was left unspecified-- %$* 13
left to future generations to decide what equality was going to mean. %$* 13
i want to go to the team arguing against the motion which in this case means that you actually are arguing that the constitution supports and requires states to license same- sex marriage. %$* 13
your opponents are saying that by citing the equal protection clause, you can only do so by fundamentally redefining marriage, and in doing so, actually creating a new right. %$* 13
and i want to ask you to respond to that. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 157
i would say that we're not asking for a new right. %$* 157
we are a new group asking for access to an existing right. %$* 157
so, for example, if we look at loving v. %$* 157
virginia, or turner v. %$* 157
safley, which my friend and colleague evan wolfson referred to, those are cases pertaining to interracial marriage and inmate marriage. %$* 157
however, when those plaintiffs sought the right to marry, they did not seek the specific right to interracial marriage. %$* 157
they did not seek the specific right to inmate marriage. %$* 157
they sought the right to marry. %$* 157
john eastman, you want to respond? %$* 13
yeah, i do. %$* 154
look, because the test the supreme court has developed for addressing these equal protection questions is whether the groups are similarly situated, you have to be adopting a view of marriage in which the groups are similarly situated to make that claim. %$* 154
and you necessarily have to be rejecting the view of marriage in which the groups are quite obviously not similarly situated. %$* 154
and it's that change in the understanding of the purpose of the institution of marriage that requires us to treat this as a new claim rather than just access to the existing institution. %$* 154
john, just for clarity, what do you mean-- %$* 13
just if you can be more concrete about the sense of "similarly situated." %$* 13
yeah. %$* 154
so-- %$* 154
any two adult relationships are similarly situated if the purpose of the relationship is to foster the love and commitment between the relationships. %$* 154
and if that's what the purpose of marriage was, then i would say it violates equal protection not to extend same-sex marriage to-- %$* 154
or not to extend marriage to same-sex couples, to polyamorous or polygamous couples, to consenting adults in familiar relationship of all sorts. %$* 154
if instead the purpose is this unique biological complementarity of men and women that bring men and women together for the purpose of producing the children that are the result of that union, then two men are not capable of having-- %$* 154
women, you're saying you're fertile, that's right, but not-- %$* 154
you know, kenji says at some point in his book, "to say that only men can be fathers and only women can be mothers is to engage in sex stereotyping." no, it's not. %$* 154
it goes to the very essence of the difference between men and women on this core biological purpose. %$* 154
okay. %$* 13
let me bring it to-- %$* 13
yeah, let me bring it to evan wolfson. %$* 13
well, very quickly to that, people marry for many reasons, and we do not dictate-- %$* 156
we do not have the government dictating to you why you marry the person you love and what your marriage needs to be about. %$* 156
for many people it is about procreating. %$* 156
for many people it isn't. %$* 156
for many people it's about raising children, gay and non-gay parents raising their kids. %$* 156
and for many people it's not about raising kids at all. %$* 156
there are many reasons why people marry. %$* 156
and in this free society, that belonged-- %$* 156
that choice belongs to us, not to the government, and government is not to be used as a weapon to impose one ideological view on everyone else. %$* 156
but i want to go back to your question, john, where you talked about this question of a new right. %$* 156
you know, from 1776 until 1948 not a single court in the country was willing to strike down restrictions on people seeking to marry someone of, quote, unquote, "the wrong sex." and finally in 1948 the california supreme court, john eastman's state-- %$* 156
i'm not sure how you felt about it-- %$* 156
but john eastman's state said that-- %$* 156
struck down race restrictions on marriage. %$* 156
and what the court said in that case was, "the essence of the freedom to marry is the right to marry the person who is precious to you. %$* 156
people are not interchangeable," the court said, "like trains. %$* 156
it's not like if someone else goes-- %$* 156
one goes by and you're not allowed to marry that one, you'll just marry the next one." gay people share the same interest in marrying the person who is precious to us without arbitrary restriction by the government because that's what the freedom to marry is all about. %$* 156
and that's not a new right, that's the right that we as americans have, and it's the right that gay people seek to share. %$* 156
sherif girgis, i'll come to you one last time on this question of whether it's a new right or not. %$* 13
no. %$* 155
i mean, of course it's a new right. %$* 155
i mean, it's basically changing the understanding of marriage in order to say that same-sex couples are similarly situated. %$* 155
i mean-- %$* 155
so the answer to professor yoshino's question is of course the equal protection clause applies to everybody. %$* 155
if a gay person walking into this building-- %$* 155
is this a state-run institution-- %$* 155
if it were and a gay person were charged one cent more, however trivial the cost, that's an equal protection violation. %$* 155
that's not what we're talking about. %$* 155
that just basically runs right over the question of what marriage is. %$* 155
and here's a clear way to put it. %$* 155
i want to know by what principle professor yoshino or evan wolfson would say, "look, if someone says to you"-- %$* 155
and there are people who say this now-- %$* 155
"'there are three of us, we're three men, we've thrown our lot in for the long haul, we're committed to it through thick and thin'-- %$* 155
" and here's why, it's not because-- %$* 155
you say, "oh, well, it's perfectly substituted. %$* 155
you can settle for one." they say, "no, for our identity." that doesn't work. %$* 155
it's not the most fulfilling bond. %$* 155
surely the principle is recognition of the relationship in which you find most personal fulfillment. %$* 155
we don't want to be stigmatized. %$* 155
we don't want our kids stigmatized. %$* 155
we've been forced into the closet partly because of the gay marriage progress, because we're an embarrassment to the movement, but now we want our turn. %$* 155
what is the answer to that? %$* 155
commitment-- %$* 155
i'm astonished it took them that long to go there because whenever somebody starts talking about polygamy or all this other stuff, it means they do not have an answer to the question that's on the table. %$* 156
gay people are not saying, "let's have no rules and lets have everything happen." what gay people are saying is, "let us have what you have. %$* 156
just as you have the freedom to marry the person who is precious to you and to build a life together under the law, so would we to seek that-- %$* 156
are you, however, then to some degree calling upon tradition? %$* 13
you do want to preserve certain traditional aspects, for example, monogamy. %$* 13
i'm not sure where you came to that from what i said, but what i-- %$* 156
well-- %$* 13
say is that-- %$* 156
i think that you were-- %$* 13
i think you were casting aspersions on their argument that things were going to move to polygamy. %$* 13
and so i'm coming back and saying, "huh, well, that sounds as though you are-- %$* 13
you would not support polygamy," and that you do not think that, that would be a right, that you actually have-- %$* 13
no. %$* 156
and i'm not debating you. %$* 13
i'm actually looking for clarification. %$* 13
right, and what i said is when people try to drag the conversation over to polygamy, it's that they don't have an answer to the question that we're debating tonight, which is, "what reason does the government have for excluding loving and committed gay couples from what other couples have? %$* 156
" we could have a million different other debates-- %$* 156
actually, i-- %$* 13
it wasn't an evasion, actually. %$* 155
i just wanted to come to this point. %$* 155
sherif girgis. %$* 13
here's what i was saying. %$* 155
i was saying you have a principle by which you say whether people are being excluded unfairly or not. %$* 155
now, we can just name our principle, we can pick it out of a hat. %$* 155
then, of course, we could win by stipulation. %$* 155
i could say, "well, my principle is any man and woman as long as one of them has freckles. %$* 155
and of course we would laugh at them and we can say, "oh, go apply it equally." i'm asking you why your vision isn't arbitrary compared to this better one. %$* 155
not the one person-- %$* 155
okay. %$* 13
i find most %$* 155
let-- %$* 13
but the relationship-- %$* 155
let's let kenji answer that question. %$* 13
there're so many answers to that. %$* 157
but let me just begin with one, which is-- %$* 157
you know, where chief justice roberts is going during oral arguments with-- %$* 157
by asking whether this is sex discrimination. %$* 157
so, if you actually think about the current definition of marriage that you hold, and you say, "a man can marry a woman but a man cannot marry a man," that is spatial sex-discrimination. %$* 157
so, he asks whether this is sex discrimination. %$* 157
and i think that on its face, it's very hard to argue that it is not. %$* 157
so, when we get to the issue of polygamy, if you have polygamists coming in on the day after the supreme court rules, hopefully, in favor of same-sex marriage this june, and they say, "we want to get married," numerocity is not a heightened scrutiny classification in this country, right? %$* 157
so, the sex discrimination argument drives a clean wedge in between the argument about what we're keeping intact about marriage and what we're changing about marriage. %$* 157
and i would go on, just a little bit, to say, you know, mr. %$* 157
girgis has written a very, i think, thoughtful book about-- %$* 157
called "what is marriage? %$* 157
" about the marriage debate. %$* 157
and essentially, he says that-- %$* 157
three principles of marriage-- %$* 157
one is that there's a kind of mind-body union, which is only attainable, apparently, by heterosexual couples. %$* 157
the second is that it is oriented towards family, right? %$* 157
and then the third is it that it is monogamous and it is hopefully permanent, right, because i don't think you're against all divorces. %$* 157
i think you're against only no-fault divorce. %$* 157
so, i go down each one of these, and i say-- %$* 157
well, let me go in reverse order. %$* 157
i think gay couples are just as capable of monogamy and of permanence. %$* 157
i think gay couples are just as capable of having children in the same way that adoptive parents who are heterosexual have children. %$* 157
so, unless you want to denigrate, you know, adoptive parents who are heterosexual, unless you want to denigrate heterosexuals who use assistive reproductive technology-- %$* 157
with the assistance of a sperm donor or an egg donor-- %$* 157
unless you want to denigrate sterile couples, i think that it would be an arbitrary distinction to keep out gay couples simply because they can't procreate internal to the union. %$* 157
and with regard to the mind- body union, essentially, what mr. %$* 157
girgis says in his book is that a man and a woman-- %$* 157
even if both of them are sterile-- %$* 157
accomplish something in their sexual coitus that is different in kind-- %$* 157
right, not in degree-- %$* 157
from two men having sex with each other, right? %$* 157
and so, if anyone is stipulating something, or suggesting that something should be given to him simply by fiat or stipulation, i would posit that it is the person who says, "there's just something categorically different, even in the absence of procreation, about heterosexual sex and coitus that makes it categorically different from homosexual sex." %$* 157
well, sherif, would you make that point to a judge? %$* 13
would you make-- %$* 13
actually make that argument? %$* 13
well, do you stand by that characterization, and would you actually say, "well, in fact, your honor, yes, there is something different, and that's what we're here arguing." %$* 13
well, i would say a couple of things about it. %$* 155
first of all, you know, you disparaged the greeks and the romans earlier. %$* 155
the reason in the book that we bring up people who had no connection to judaism or christianity, had nothing like our modern concept of gay orientation, and made remarkably convergent view of marriage-- %$* 155
the reason we do that is to show that there is a question for the other side that they haven't been able to answer, which is, "how did that come about? %$* 155
" there wasn't religion or it wasn't bigotry. %$* 155
and now, there are-- %$* 155
what professor yoshino's question shows is that there are ways to describe any view that make it look less plausible. %$* 155
but i can do that from a revisionist view, too. %$* 155
i can say, "what's the-- %$* 155
when two men throw their lot in together, and do it for the long haul, and share all the burdens and benefits of common-law what's so special about whether-- %$* 155
what brought them together is that they're two brothers or two best friends, or what brought them together is climax? %$* 155
what's so morally significant about orgasm? %$* 155
" there's a way of describing the views that denigrates it, but that wouldn't be fair to professor yoshino, and it wouldn't be fair to mine either. %$* 155
let me just take one dimension of the questions that he brought. %$* 155
he said, "how can two men not have a bodily union? %$* 155
" well, here's the question. %$* 155
why is sex integral to bodily union? %$* 155
everybody in the debate agrees that somehow, if it's just about fostering and expressing affection, and vulnerability, and tenderness, than other activities can do that. %$* 155
and yet, in the book, we develop an aristotelian account, where it's about coordinated action towards a single, common end that completes and encompasses them both. %$* 155
and that's why the kind of union that a man and a woman can have is different in that respect. %$* 155
let me-- %$* 13
i'm going to let evan respond to that. %$* 13
i feel that we're losing our constitutional filter, to some degree. %$* 13
not-- %$* 13
no. %$* 13
no. %$* 13
not wildly off. %$* 13
that's why i'm asking "would you say these things to a judge? %$* 13
" i'm trying to herd you back in there. %$* 13
you didn't pick up on it. %$* 13
but let me let evan respond. %$* 13
well-- %$* 156
but i want to try to return to the constitution. %$* 13
well, to try to bring it back to the constitution, but from where mr. %$* 156
girgis just left it, the-- %$* 156
the greeks' and the romans' conception of marriage, not to mention many others in between, is not one unified history-- %$* 156
historical embodiment of what you're talking about that suddenly is changing. %$* 156
the idea of marriage, the concept of marriage, the rules of marriage were so completely foreign to anything we as americans, particularly under our constitution will tolerate. %$* 156
the subordination of women, the patriarchal domination of the household, including slaves. %$* 156
i mean, the ownership of the procreative rights and the ability to alienate or even kill your own children. %$* 156
i mean, one could go on and on and on. %$* 156
and so it's just sort of ironic to hear that exalted when actually the very plain words of our constitution guaranteeing equality and the multiple cases talking about the freedom to marry and the evident humanity of gay people seeking that freedom to marry for the same mix of reasons, some of which may have to do with children, but many of which don't and they are yet equally important and valid. %$* 156
i think it really just shows, if you want to make an argument and you suddenly find something you like in the greeks and romans, you're willing to overlook a lot. %$* 156
and apparently, you’re-- %$* 156
willing to overlook a lot in the constitution if you want to deny something important to gay people. %$* 156
okay. %$* 13
john eastman, i want to-- %$* 13
i want to take a question to you, or are you dying to respond? %$* 13
no, you can give me the question. %$* 154
i’ll figure out a way to respond-- %$* 154
okay. %$* 13
you can save it for your two-minute closing. %$* 13
so-- %$* 13
so the-- %$* 13
we understand the equal protection clause being something that's triggered in relatively extraordinary circumstances, particularly when there's a disadvantaged group of people, sometimes called a class of people. %$* 13
and you've made the argument that this is a matter that should be left up to state legislatures because it doesn't trigger that. %$* 13
i want to know why you're saying,-- %$* 13
you know, your opponents made a compelling argument for centuries of discrimination and abuse and that, you know, the story-- %$* 13
the story is pretty much told, that it's time for the equal protection clause to kick in on this. %$* 13
why not? %$* 13
well, so-- %$* 154
so it requires us so have a rethinking about the purpose. %$* 154
and evan has done a very nice job in turning this to why adults enter into the institution of marriage. %$* 154
that's not the relevant question. %$* 154
the question is, why did the state get involved in the marriage business in the first place. %$* 154
and that has nothing to do with, it lays its hands on and gives my dignity because they've given me a marriage license or it sanctions my adult relationship. %$* 154
the state has no interest or business, quite frankly, in getting involved in the institution of marriage for those purposes. %$* 154
it's this unique procreative ability that does it. %$* 154
and that's-- %$* 154
you know, and you go back to the greeks and every-- %$* 154
it's not just the greeks and the romans, it's every society in human history that's come up with the same thing. %$* 154
the leading anthropologist, claude levi strauss, the family, based on a union more or less durable, but socially-- %$* 154
john, my question is a little bit different. %$* 13
why should this not be decided by judges but decided by legislatures? %$* 13
because the question is, in order to treat them as an equal protection violation, we have to assume that the groups are similarly situated. %$* 154
that then requires that i answer a question that the constitution does not answer: which view of marriage are we going to have; this adult-centric consent view or the long-standing conjugal view? %$* 154
that question is not answered in the constitution. %$* 154
and only if you answer that question on the former is it a violation of equal protection. %$* 154
and that's-- %$* 154
and who decides that question i think is the real critical one. %$* 154
kenji yoshino. %$* 13
yeah, i'm-- %$* 157
i'm a little puzzled by that characterization because, to me, it sounds like if we were debating this back in 1966 in the year before loving vs. %$* 157
virginia, it would be like saying, oh, well there are two views of marriage on the table. %$* 157
one view says that, you know, god put the five races-- %$* 157
this is actual quotation from a trial court judge-- %$* 157
on five different continents, and but for a violation of his will, the races would not have mixed. %$* 157
so i think the hidden irony of this is that if we were to take that trial court judge's word, europeans would all have to go back to europe or caucasians will have to go back to europe, and i would have to go back to asia and so on and so forth. %$* 157
so i think, that-- %$* 157
unintended consequences there. %$* 157
but the view is, are we going to choose the vision of marriage that allows for bans on interracial marriage? %$* 157
or are we going to choose the more inclusive definition of marriage that allows interracial couples access to this existing right? %$* 157
and to me, that's what he's saying. %$* 157
and i do think that the equal protection clause has an answer to that. %$* 157
so i don't think that there's one vision of marriage that the equal protection clause is impermeable to and another vision of marriage to which it speaks. %$* 157
i think that the equal protection clause speaks to the definition of marriage that we have, right. %$* 157
and just to make a final point here, i haven't heard anything yet about adoptive parents or about sterile couples or about couples that use this reproductive technology or heterosexuals. %$* 157
so, you know, if a 70-year-old and an 80-year-old want to get married, right, why should we allow them to marry under your vision? %$* 157
if procreation is so central to the definition of marriage, why would you allow individuals who could not procreate and were demonstratively unable to procreate or unwilling to procreate if they chose not to procreate when they were younger. %$* 157
do you want to take it, sherif? %$* 13
i do, yes. %$* 155
a couple-- %$* 155
there are a couple points in there. %$* 155
so, first of all, the interracial marriage thing is a red herring. %$* 155
do you know where the first place in the world that interracial marriage first came up? %$* 155
it was in the colonial united states. %$* 155
nancy cott says this. %$* 155
why? %$* 155
because that was a regime of slavery. %$* 155
it was clearly-- %$* 155
now, you look at the history, it's impossible to conclude that it was about anything about oppressing marriages. %$* 155
to believe that there's an analogy here, you would have to believe that biological parenting-- %$* 155
thinking that that matters is on par with thinking that your skin color matters. %$* 155
and justice sotomayor herself has written, in a recent case, "it's a principle recognized in our cases that the biological bond between a parent and child is meaningful." she would never say the same thing about racial purity which is the language of these-- %$* 155
while a second thing, on the idea that this isn't something new, here's a quote. %$* 155
"enlarging the concept to embrace same-sex couples would necessarily transform the institution into something new."that is bill eskridge, one of the pioneer legal scholars in favor of same-sex marriage and gay rights for 25 years admitting the plain fact and just saying it's a good idea. %$* 155
now, on the last point, of course, no matter what your marriage policy is, artificial reproductive technology no matter what your policy is, there will be households in which kids are being reared without a marriage at the head of the household on their vision as well. %$* 155
but they want to smuggle this off stage to say that that consideration just for same-sex couples requires just extending it to marriage. %$* 155
i say if there are concrete needs that are arise wherever kids are in a home, you need to make a policy available wherever kids are in a home, whether it's a mom and her mom who moved in to help her raise the kid because she's a single mom, which is the most common kind of same-sex parent-led household or otherwise. %$* 155
i want to go to audience questions, so i just want to remind you, but before i do it, i just want to put one question to evan wolfson to take something back from what your opponent said earlier when they cited, i think 14 cases where they say the supreme court, when discussing marriage as a fundamental right, made it clear that it was between a man and a woman. %$* 13
do you concede that they-- %$* 13
that's actually accurate? %$* 13
and if so, does it matter? %$* 13
evan wolfson. %$* 13
well, it is accurate that those cases that had reached the supreme court and triggered the rulings in those cases were not about gay people's freedom to marry, because it's this case that has brought that-- %$* 156
right. %$* 13
but-- %$* 13
but does that mean the silence on-- %$* 13
relative silence means that it would-- %$* 13
necessarily meant one man, one woman? %$* 13
no, because we're talking about-- %$* 156
we're talking about the freedom to marry and the question is to whether the freedom to marry can be denied to this group of people, this individual, this couple and the reasons that they bring before the court. %$* 156
the notion that there's this precedent does not weigh very heavily with you. %$* 13
well, i don't-- %$* 156
that's not a precedent. %$* 156
okay. %$* 13
that's just-- %$* 156
that's just where we-- %$* 156
the record in which we've gotten to right now. %$* 156
and, you know, 65 courts have had no problem taking the principles that underlay those rulings and applying them now to this question involving these people being denied for these reasons. %$* 156
and i just have to say, it's now my turn to be a little puzzled about the reference to children because, again, marriage is not just about children. %$* 156
there are many, many reasons why gay people should and deserve the freedom to marry just as many many non-gay people deserve the freedom to marry. %$* 156
even justice scalia has said that if your argument rests on the procreative argument, your denial of marriage to gay people is on very shaky ground. %$* 156
now, i rarely agree with justice scalia, but when he's right, he's right. %$* 156
and he was right there. %$* 156
but what does speak in this conversation and in this debate is the voice of those children who, like kenji's kids, are being raised by gay parents. %$* 156
and the denial of the freedom to marry harms those children and harms those families, and there's no good reason for it, and that's another good reason why the constitution forbids this kind of discrimination. %$* 156
let's go to some questions. %$* 13
just wait for the mic to come down from your right side. %$* 13
and if you could stand up and tell us your name, please. %$* 13
it's going to be handed down to you. %$* 13
it's back three rows. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
if you can wave to the mic. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
oh, i have this request. %$* 13
really pose a question. %$* 13
don't debate with the debaters. %$* 13
so whatever you want to say, go for it. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
you have the confidence, now go for it. %$* 13
okay. %$* 19
you want my name. %$* 19
it's lynne litz the question is, i would like those who are talking about children to ask if they would require, in the marriage certificate, to-- %$* 19
for those people getting married to swear in addition to all the other information that they have to put in, that they are going to have children or if they are unable to have children, and if that will be a requirement for marriage. %$* 19
okay. %$* 13
i'm going to-- %$* 13
i'm going to-- %$* 13
i prefer to pass on the question. %$* 13
and i think you can come up and chat with them because it's an interesting one, but i don't think it's helping us on the constitutional thing that you all need to vote on. %$* 13
so with respect i'm going to pass on it-- %$* 13
right here, and you can pass the mic down front. %$* 13
so that's sort of what i'm hoping for, and i say that with respect to the questions that i don't take. %$* 13
try to keep it on the topic. %$* 13
and, by the way, it was a perfectly framed question. %$* 13
hi. %$* 19
my name is samantha harris. %$* 19
and what i want to know is looking at marriage as a child-centered institution there are now large numbers of people in two-parent households, gay and straight, where it is not, i think the way that you put it was, "the best." they're not-- %$* 19
the child is not the biological product of the union. %$* 19
they may be adopted, maybe donor eggs, and maybe donor sperm. %$* 19
but you have similarly situated families, two parents and a child who is not the biological child of both or either parent. %$* 19
and in that situation, with those two-parent households, i want to know why the state does not have an interest in affording all of those children and their parents the same legal protection. %$* 19
yeah, so look, couple of-- %$* 154
john eastman. %$* 13
look, a couple of things, one, we don't have any evidence yet one way or the other whether issuing a marriage license itself to adoptive parents to same-sex parents has any effect on the upbringing of their children. %$* 154
what we do know is when it's-- %$* 154
when you move away from both biological parents, the increased risk to serious emotional and development problems to the children more than doubles. %$* 154
that's true whether the parents are same sex. %$* 154
it's true whether the parents are opposite sex. %$* 154
it's true when you have one lacking in the biological connection. %$* 154
and so if you take that-- %$* 154
and the most comprehensive dataset we have is from the centers for disease control that demonstrates-- %$* 154
you go from 7 percent to 17 1/2 percent risk to the kids when both biological parents are not involved. %$* 154
now if that means there are 82 percent in non-biological parent households, the kids are doing just fine. %$* 154
but that differential is significant. %$* 154
it's significant for the state's reason in getting involved in the marriage business in the first place. %$* 154
and when you alter the understanding of marriage that discourages a significant number of people who are the biological parents of that child from entering into that relationship and that institution for raising that child, you cause pretty catastrophic harms to kids. %$* 154
and that's why the state has a fundamental interest here in not weakening that institutional draw that every society in human history is settled on for the best way to encourage that relationship and that structure. %$* 154
kenji yoshino. %$* 13
put very simply, that seems to be a very good argument on your part for why you should be against artificial reproductive technology, but not a good argument for why you should be against same-sex marriage. %$* 157
another question. %$* 13
right there. %$* 13
hi there. %$* 19
my name is my question is for john eastman. %$* 19
so as you may be aware, marriage and familial relationships often provide-- %$* 19
are given a package of government benefits, you know, tax purposes, birth, death certificates, things like that. %$* 19
so if there can exist single parents and married heterosexual couples without children that are on the receiving end of some of these government benefits, what is the legitimate state interest in preventing same-sex couples from being on the receiving end of these same benefits? %$* 19
so the same question. %$* 154
the state's interests-- %$* 154
we're not looking at any individual case, but institutionally. %$* 154
and if i create an institution where i encourage people to enter in that institution who have the unique capability of creating children through their own sexual relations in a way that no other relationship has, the state has an interest in encouraging as many of those people as they can in the institution of marriage, and that's why we preside-- %$* 154
we provide all sorts of incentives, including benefits to that. %$* 154
now, i suppose i could get more perfect in my drawing of the line. %$* 154
i could have some government dictate out there and say, "i'm going to-- %$* 154
i'm going to come by your house every thursday night to make sure you're having sexual relations."i could do all sorts of things, but we know for a fact that when men and women have sexual relations, they tend to have kids whether by on purpose or accident. %$* 154
it's a result of that conduct. %$* 154
it's part of the nature of the relationship. %$* 154
and that's why we create the institution to channel that unique ability there. %$* 154
and if i alter that and i say, "this is all about the parents-- %$* 154
the loving relationship between the parents," i have undermined the reason the state got involved in the business in the first place, and i've weakened the institutional draw. %$* 154
let me just-- %$* 154
you know-- %$* 154
let me – %$* 13
sorry, yeah, i-- %$* 154
filibuster. %$* 154
it's-- %$* 154
i want to remind you that we're in the question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan, your moderator. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, arguing it out over this motion, "the equal protection clause does not require states to license same-sex marriages." well, we're sort of arguing it out over that motion. %$* 13
let's see if we can-- %$* 13
would you like to respond to-- %$* 13
well, i %$* 156
because i-- %$* 13
again, i-- %$* 13
in the end you're going to have to vote on whether you think the equal protection clause applies, which is a different issue from the policy debates that we're discussing now and effects on family. %$* 13
so, i want to-- %$* 13
i want to ask you to raise your hand knowing that that's what you're going to do. %$* 13
but go ahead and have a-- %$* 13
i think one of the striking consequences of the degree to which we have shown there is no good reason for denying gay people the freedom to marry is that our opponents are left making such an impoverished argument about marriage, such a dismissive argument about heterosexuals, or about parents, or what they need in order to preserve their bonds, or to get married in the first place, when in fact, what we're talking about something that it-- %$* 156
for many people is a high aspiration, and a worthy thing, and a thing of great dignity and meaning. %$* 156

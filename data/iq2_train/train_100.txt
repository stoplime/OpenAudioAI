well i think you, and let me if i may, remind us of the motion that this debate is not about the palestinian-israeli conflict, the motion is about the last ten months and it, whether hamas is still a terrorist organization. %$* 325
and the facts are that everything that hamas did over the past month, ten months cannot be qualified as terrorist. %$* 325
i mean you can come up with – %$* 325
indiscriminate firing at children – %$* 326
well – %$* 325
schools, they’re all – %$* 326
it’s interesting you should say that, you know i, because when you look at it, you will find out that, sir, i think you should know that, this was actually the violations that came, came from the fatah side. %$* 325
and the fatah was associated with that as well as – %$* 325
not at all. %$* 326
ghazi hamad is the name of the person that actually speaks about these matters and you can go and check and, and see every one of the actions that was in violation was denounced by hamas officially. %$* 325
so again, facts or statements? %$* 325
who holds corporal shalit which was kidnapped in our territory? %$* 32
well i wouldn't know. %$* 325
it’s the hamas. %$* 326
what you wouldn't know – %$* 326
who holds the ten thousand palestinians sitting in jails that haven’t seen – %$* 323
but who holds – %$* 32
they are all terrorists and this is the difference. %$* 326
they’re all terrorists? %$* 323
thirty-seven legislators – %$* 32
all ten thousand of them. %$* 323
oh absolutely. %$* 323
all ten thousand palestinians including the fourteen-year-old – %$* 323
let me tell you that – %$* 326
then what are you afraid of? %$* 323
put them on trial. %$* 323
let me tell you that they are not – %$* 326
put them on trial. %$* 323
it’s not just the ten thousand there. %$* 326
you have a democracy. %$* 323
there are fifty thousand more. %$* 326
you have a democracy. %$* 323
mm-hmm. %$* 326
let them go, let them have trials. %$* 323
they are all – %$* 323
prove your case. %$* 323
they are all being trialed, they are all being processed. %$* 326
let me, let me – %$* 32
and i wish the same chance was given to the israeli kids that are being targeted by these guys. %$* 326
oops. %$* 323
i know there we go again, every time those darn palestinians get in the way of our missiles and our tanks and end up dead. %$* 323
whoops, there it goes again. %$* 323
but yet when we do it, we’re sorry. %$* 323
but you, you target and that’s the moral superiority. %$* 323
so the mor-, the moral position that you’ve always taken. %$* 323
look, it’s terrible when civilians on both sides get killed. %$* 323
it’s terrible, it’s got to stop and the way you stop it is you dare to struggle. %$* 323
you break the labels, you sit down with no preconditions and you try to move ahead. %$* 323
and if it doesn’t work, you're right back to where you were but at least there’s a chance. %$* 323
absolutely, this is exactly what we want. %$* 326
we, we say stop the killing, stop the terror and we will sit and talk. %$* 326
and what about your side? %$* 323
question. %$* 321
what we will talk about, what we will talk about? %$* 326
the road map to peace. %$* 326
we only have about four minutes left for questions so i do want to recognize someone there in the very back, please, stand up. %$* 321
i have a question. %$* 32
my name is goldin and i'm a teacher. %$* 32
i have a question to mr. %$* 32
cohen. %$* 32
if your argument hamas, with that said, with everything going on according to your plan and you would be, would you go for even a short visit to israel just to recognize, just to receive congratulation? %$* 32
would you take such a risk? %$* 32
i go to israel all the time. %$* 323
in fact, in fact sir, sir %$* 323
sir, i lost family in a bombing in jerusalem, i lost family in world war ii, i cannot tell you how difficult it is for me as a jew to sit back and for sixty years, watch what has occurred – and not just in the name of people in israel, but in the names of jews all over the world. %$* 323
the answer is yes, i would go, and yes i would gladly do what has to be done to break bread and to try to bring some sanity to this war of labeling. %$* 323
that’s the problem. %$* 323
we are so locked into labels, we are so locked into an inability. %$* 323
you must do this or i’ll do that, i must do this or you’ll do that. %$* 323
there’s absolutely no down side to sitting down without preconditions and talking. %$* 323
absolutely. %$* 32
john o’sullivan. %$* 321
john o’sullivan has been asking – %$* 321
i think that there is, just on the general point here, there are consequences to launching unsuccessful wars against israel. %$* 324
the first is that israel ends up with territories which didn’t originally belong to it, the second is that there are going to be large numbers of refugees, and the third is that the israelis, given their strategic, long-term vulnerability are going to be very suspicious of proposals for peace that don’t come accompanied by guarantees. %$* 324
but do come accompanied by demands for a right of return that would negate the jewish state altogether. %$* 324
okay. %$* 321
we, we have time for one more audience question, preferably a short one, and please tell us who it’s directed to and lets see. %$* 321
where do we, do we have someone with a microphone up there? %$* 321
okay, go ahead. %$* 321
i’d like to ask two brief questions, and i’d like to thank mr. %$* 32
o’sullivan – %$* 32
let’s make it one. %$* 321
okay. %$* 32
we have two minutes. %$* 321
i’d like to thank mr. %$* 32
o’sullivan and mr. %$* 32
perry for i think making the most uh, intelligent arguments tonight. %$* 32
um, i just want to ask the for side how they, if they feel that political power is a uh, moderating force on uh, extremists. %$* 32
and how their view of terrorism uh, is consistent with the actions of david ben-gurion and the bombing of the king david hotel. %$* 32
who would like to pick, steven? %$* 321
i’ll – steven cook. %$* 32
i’ll go for it, thank you very much. %$* 322
um, i think that there’s really no condition. %$* 322
the pothole theory of politics, that somehow hamas, which is dedicated to a broader, ideological agenda, is someone going to have to pick up the garbage, that that is going to moderate their view of the world. %$* 322
that certainly didn’t happen with the plo once it returned to gaza, i don't expect it will happen with hamas. %$* 322
now of course the question of bomb, of the king david hotel, everybody trucks that out as, as evidence of terrorism, the fact that the, the israeli, israelis before, in the pre- state era engaged in terrorism. %$* 322
my understanding of the bombing of the king david hotel was that it was not directed specifically against innocent civilians, but it was against british occupation, authorities. %$* 322
that is not consistent with the definition of terrorism. %$* 322
alright. %$* 159
uh, thank – %$* 159
there, there were terrorist acts against british troops, during the war, by the way, just to make that point. %$* 324
oh. %$* 323
alright, it is now, it is now time for all of you in the audience, this is the moment, this is time to vote. %$* 321
this is the ticket, pull it out of your pocket or your lap, wherever it is, your handbag. %$* 321
if you want to vote for the motion, tear off the “for,” the green for from the ticket, the top of the ticket, and slip it into the ballet box that will be passed among you. %$* 321
if you want to vote against, tear off “against,” the red. %$* 321
tear off the red against and put that into the ballot box. %$* 321
and if you do not know which side you're on, if you are undecided, put your entire ticket into the ballot box. %$* 321
the ballot boxes are going to be passed around the ushers, the front and the back of the auditorium. %$* 321
pass it to the next person, we want to make sure everybody’s vote is counted. %$* 321
if you need a ticket, just wave your arm in the air, the ushers have extra tickets. %$* 321
everyone gets one vote, and now we’re going to turn, while you're finishing this up, we’re going to turn to the panelists, beginning with the side opposing the motion. %$* 321
and we are going to ask them to make their final argument. %$* 321
so opposing the motion, against, stanley cohen. %$* 321
two minutes. %$* 321
sure a lot more difficult debating here than it was in qatar or in doha. %$* 323
i have a friend, dear friend of mine, believe it or not, an israeli. %$* 323
named leah tsemel, famous israeli lawyer, she used to be called arafat’s whore by israeli politicians. %$* 323
leah said to me one day when we were driving to the erez crossing where we had to wait twelve hours to go in to see people, leah said in response to a comment about how they want to drive us to the sea and drown us, leah said the only one who’s going to drive us to the sea and drown us is ourselves. %$* 323
the notions that palestinians have nothing to do but to die or to kill after all of this time is the difficulty. %$* 323
we see resistance as this desire and this need to be terrorists, to die and kill which is defied by what’s happening on the ground. %$* 323
the real shame here, the real sin here is for the first time in history, palestinian and israeli kids aren’t going to schools together. %$* 323
they’re not spending time together, they’re not falling in love together, they’re not doing businesses together. %$* 323
and the problem is the walls of labels are keeping sides apart. %$* 323
people say hamas is a terrorist organization, i say israel is a terrorist state. %$* 323
who cares? %$* 323
the two sides need to sit down without preconditions, see if you can find common ground as people to grow so those kids can fall in love again, thank you very much. %$* 323
and now for the motion, steven a. cook. %$* 321
it’s amazing, isn’t it? %$* 322
everything i told you would happen, happened. %$* 322
our interlocutors on the other side did not address the issue at hand, they shifted to israeli behavior. %$* 322
but i want to respond to some specific things that each of them said to demonstrate how weak their arguments are. %$* 322
and since stanley impugned my credibility and my expertise, i’ll return the favor. %$* 322
stanley spoke passionately ponytail waving, arms in the air, doing the whole hippie thing, talking about many or most in the world believe. %$* 322
come on stanley, i got my ph.d.because, i didn’t need to go to law school because i'm the son of a lawyer. %$* 322
you should know every first year law student knows that when you argue “many in the world,” “most in the world,” “most people believe,” it’s a logical fallacy. %$* 322
just because most people believe it doesn’t make it true. %$* 322
what is mahmoud talking about when he talks about protorecognition? %$* 322
is that like being half pregnant? %$* 322
you can’t be half pregnant, you either recognize or you don’t. %$* 322
i had, throughout the 1990s, i spent my time parsing the words of palestinian leaders, do they or do they not recognize, what is protorecognition? %$* 322
hudna means somehow recognition, but hudna’s in. %$* 322
i don't understand it. %$* 322
the majority of the palestinians did not vote for hamas. %$* 322
forty-four percent of the people voted for hamas. %$* 322
now i'm sure the people on the other side of the room would say that george bush was not democratically elected because the majority of americans didn’t vote for him in 2000.well i would apply the same principle to hamas. %$* 322
i'm shocked, i'm actually shocked that mark perry’s interlocutor is osama – %$* 322
fifteen seconds. %$* 321
oh i’ll skip that part. %$* 322
i’ll just say, i’ll just say that it is extraordinary that mark perry gave all the evidence you needed to vote for the proposition. %$* 322
he said his hamas interlocutor said that they would not give up violence because it’s a bargaining chip. %$* 322
time’s up. %$* 322
so thus the lives of innocents is a bargaining chip, it’s a political power player on the part of hamas. %$* 322
they will continue their terrorism, thank you. %$* 322
i urge you to vote for. %$* 322
oh you’ve already voted, so thanks for your vote. %$* 322
against the motion, mahmoud ould mohamedou. %$* 321
thank you very much. %$* 325
well i had a bit of an uplifting argument to finish with but i guess that unfortunately we’ve moved from intelligent debate to acuteness, apparently winning it. %$* 325
and it’s a pity because the whole debate was not necessarily about this pro- israeli or pro-arab or pro-palestinian. %$* 325
it’s really something different. %$* 325
it was about justice, people fighting for justice are not terrorists, it’s about international legality, wars of national liberation are not terrorism. %$* 325
and it’s about the cogency of our moral principles. %$* 325
but it seems that all of this uh, sort of um, again acuteness that was adopted to address these life and death matters seems to have won the room and you know, fine. %$* 325
but again back to stanley’s point, history marches on. %$* 325
um and although one might think that there’s something inevitable about the arab, israeli conflict, i for one would like to believe that it’s not. %$* 325
imagine if the eu were to call a hamas delegation or have an adult conversation with them. %$* 325
imagine if the secretary of state were to address elected officials and, and invite them and discuss with them. %$* 325
imagine if the israeli population elected a government from which they asked and then to implement policies and negotiations with whomever is in charge. %$* 325
this i think would quell the violent, violence on both sides, resuscitate the peace talks, and get us into a new dynamic. %$* 325
you don’t have to imagine the opposite situation. %$* 325
we’re in it and we’ll continue to be in it as long as motions such as tonight, such as tonight’s will continue to let it. %$* 325
thank you. %$* 325
okay. %$* 321
for the motion, john o’sullivan. %$* 321
well i'm delighted that there are distinguished psychiatrists, doctors, lawyers and so on in hamas, and at the moment radovan karadzic is on the run from nato as a war criminal. %$* 324
he himself was a child psychiatrist before the war started. %$* 324
i wonder what became of his charges. %$* 324
it’s unusual for me to find myself as the idealist on the platform, but i point out that the argument that we should be having as well as the particular argument about the middle east is an argument about violence in politics. %$* 324
when violence enters politics, it’s very hard to drive it out again. %$* 324
and when indiscriminate violence against innocent people enters, it damages the society very strongly indeed. %$* 324
now that’s not the only way to have a revolution. %$* 324
polish solidarity won independence from russia. %$* 324
and that has been repeated in georgia and in the ukraine and elsewhere by a campaign of moral resistance and cultural resistance that wore down the opposition and persuaded people to come over to it. %$* 324
that’s the, that’s the kind of revolution if the, if one is needed. %$* 324
that’s the kind of revolution, recourse that we should encourage people to pursue. %$* 324
we should not turn a blind eye to their crimes because they have managed to be elected. %$* 324
it’s a fine thing to be elected, but it doesn’t absolve you from the laws of human conduct that the rest of us are supposed to obey. %$* 324
and our final argument against, mark perry. %$* 321
we won't be here two years from now, two years from now debating this question because by two years from now this, this debate will be resolved. %$* 327
why? %$* 327
because israel will be talking to hamas, that’s why. %$* 327
because they’re talking to them right now. %$* 327
how do we know that? %$* 327
because there is a proposed cease-fire in gaza in which khaled meshaal traveled to cairo and ehud olmert said, if you can stop those rockets, we’ll withdraw from gaza. %$* 327
now that might not be eyeball to eyeball talk but that’s a political understanding. %$* 327
and how did that happen? %$* 327
it happened because george bush was going to amman, jordan and dick cheney is going to riyadh, saudi arabia, to talk to those guys about helping us out in iraq and they’re looking at him and saying how are we going to do that when our own people are making a clamor about the israeli-palestinian conflict? %$* 327
and so george bush and dick cheney are picking up the phone and calling prime minister olmert and he’s saying, what? %$* 327
i can’t, they’re a terrorist organization. %$* 327
george bush is going to go, oh come on. %$* 327
where do you think this is? %$* 327
grow up, be adults. %$* 327
we’ve got a world to run. %$* 327
you want to run it? %$* 327
talk to people, talk to them. %$* 327
they might be a terrorist organization, yes they’ve killed civilians, yes it’s a terrible thing. %$* 327
after world war ii, we went into germany and put three hundred and thirty-four people on trial and called it a day. %$* 327
why? %$* 327
because we have to go forward, and it’s time to go forward. %$* 327
it’s time to go forward, thank you. %$* 327
and our final debater for the motion, ambassador daniel ayalon. %$* 321
yes. %$* 326
thank you, well what was the issue today? %$* 326
the issue was of little moral and practical nature. %$* 326
legally, are they law offenders? %$* 326
they have illegal arms, they breached the law, yes, hamas does. %$* 326
moral issue. %$* 326
are they killers of children and other innocent people, yes they are. %$* 326
and of practical issue, just a matter of common sense, is there any sense talking to them? %$* 326
will talking to them bring peace and quiet? %$* 326
well i don't think so. %$* 326
now we have to make sure the equation is right, and it’s not that they will say well we will stop killing you if you give us land, if you give us political concession. %$* 326
this is not the equation. %$* 326
if they stop killing us, we will stop hunting them. %$* 326
when they are ready for political concessions, we will give them political concessions. %$* 326
it’s apple to apple, oranges to oranges. %$* 326
this is the issue and so long as the palestinians and hamas especially, deny recognition of israel’s right to be there in their homeland, there’s not going to peace, to be peace. %$* 326
and the fact that they continued with this uh, terror, and some would call it resistance is also a fallacy because it’s not resistance. %$* 326
israel is ready to uh, to build a palestinian state. %$* 326
israel was withdrawing from territories, the entire area of gaza, areas of the west bank. %$* 326
and we are willing to talk. %$* 326
what, what are we going to talk about? %$* 326
the road map to peace, how to make peace, how to create a palestinian state which will live side by side with a jewish israel. %$* 326
this is at stake now, and so long as the palestinians do not want to do that, as long as they keep the killing, there’s nothing to talk about. %$* 326
they stop the killing, then we talk. %$* 326
alright, i want to thank all of our debaters, i want to thank all of you in the audience for your excellent questions and your good behavior. %$* 321
it’s time now to announce the results of the voting after our debaters did the very best job they could to sway you. %$* 321
here’s the number that we have. %$* 321
a hundred and fifty-nine voted for the motion, one hundred voted against which is a, almost a doubling of what it was before. %$* 321
and fifty-two said i don't know. %$* 321
so again, a hundred and fifty-nine for, a hundred, that means that a number of you didn’t vote when you first came in. %$* 321
that’s, it, it looks as if we’ve got forty-nine, fifty, fifty or so more people who voted uh, at the end. %$* 321
uh, but again we appreciate the participation of all of our debaters, we thank you in the audience, i want to invite you to return next month for the fourth intelligence squared us debate on wednesday, december 13th here at the asia society and museum. %$* 321
the motion to be debated is hollywood has promoted anti-americanism abroad. %$* 321

and tonight we're delighted that this debate is taking place in partnership with the richard paul richman center for business law and public policy, which is a joint venture of the columbia law school and the columbia business school. %$* 13
and we really want to thank them for being partners with us tonight on this. %$* 13
and we always begin these debates by having a brief conversation with the chairman of intelligence squared u.s.who brought this all to us. %$* 13
and what we do is we talk about the relevance of this debate right now. %$* 13
and the relevance is staring us in the face. %$* 13
so at this point i'd like to bring onto the stage, if you could please welcome mr. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
hi, john. %$* 1
hi. %$* 13
so, as i said, bob, timing is everything. %$* 13
we set this debate up months ago. %$* 13
and here we are. %$* 13
just take us into the relevance of this debate right now. %$* 13
well, it's incredibly timely. %$* 1
and when you see-- %$* 1
and in every newspaper you pick up, the big trouble that jpmorgan has gotten themselves into, and they would have generally be considered the best managed of all of the big banks, you realize that tonight's debate is right on in terms of timeliness. %$* 1
what we like to do in picking these debates is stack arguments where there really are potent arguments, valid arguments on both sides. %$* 13
so let's just talk through the side now arguing for the motion, the side that wants to break up the big banks, what do they have going for them? %$* 13
well, i think the first thing one needs to understand is that, what is the role of a bank? %$* 1
the important role of a bank in our economic system is to lend money to consumers who want to spend or to businesses who want to invest. %$* 1
and some of these banks are so large, about a dozen of them, that the government has designated them as “too big to fail”, which means that they have an implicit government guarantee. %$* 1
but those banks are doing so many things beyond that basic function that the argument would be that this is simply a step too far for the government to be guaranteeing all these other activities. %$* 1
these big banks are too complex to manage, as we see. %$* 1
run well, et cetera, et cetera. %$* 1
they may be too opaque to regulate. %$* 1
and also it's an unfair competitive advantage for them to have this implicit guarantee of the government because the banks that don't find it more expensive to fund their operations, and therefore more difficult to be competitors. %$* 1
and what's the argument for the other side? %$* 13
well, the argument for the other side goes back to the financial crisis and said-- %$* 1
says, these big banks were not the cause of the financial crisis. %$* 1
that was lehman brothers. %$* 1
that was bear stearns. %$* 1
that was aig. big banks really had nothing to do with it. %$* 1
moreover, the big banks are better capitalized and in much better shape now than they were then. %$* 1
and u.s.banks are in better shape than banks anywhere else in the world. %$* 1
in a global economy, you need really big banks to serve global companies and to compete with the big banks in other countries. %$* 1
and then finally, the question of what kind of regulation. %$* 1
i had a chance to ask tim geithner a question today about bank regulation. %$* 1
and he said, "you know, it's a bit like afghanistan. %$* 1
you have all of these different tribes, all these uneasy exercises of power and conflict with each other." and, of course, he's talking about the incredible complexity of financial regulation in this country. %$* 1
and then if you think about, out of a process like that, if you're going to hand out a meat ax to whack these big banks, the odds of getting a result that you think is good seem almost infinitesimal. %$* 1
well, the great thing about the debate tonight is who our debaters are. %$* 13
you're about to meet them, but they've all really lived and worked this issue for years. %$* 13
so why don't we bring them out? %$* 13
and again, thanks very much, bob rosenkranz. %$* 13
well, thank you. %$* 1
everyone seated? %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
terrific. %$* 13
i'd like to invite one more round of applause for bob rosenkranz for making this all possible. %$* 13
four letters of the alphabet: t.b.t.f.; acronymically, it's washington and wall street shorthand for “too big to fail”." and it's the concept that justified taxpayers having to bail out banks in trouble in the financial crisis, because the thinking goes that if one of these really big banks goes down it could take everything else in the economic system with it. %$* 13
solution, how about breaking up the big banks? %$* 13
drastic, right? %$* 13
but would that actually solve the problem? %$* 13
would we be safe from the threat of tbtf if we broke up the big banks? %$* 13
well, that sounds like the makings of a great debate, so let's have it. %$* 13
yes or no to this statement, "break up the big banks," a debate from intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we are at the kaufman music center in new york city, and we are in partnership with the richard paul richman center for business, law and public policy, a joint venture of columbia business school and columbia law school. %$* 13
as always, we have four superbly qualified debaters who have all lived and worked this issue, but they're coming at it from opposite sides. %$* 13
two against two on the motion "break up the big banks." and as always we go in three rounds and then the live audience here votes to pick the winner. %$* 13
and only one side wins. %$* 13
our motion, again, "break up the big banks." and now let's meet the team arguing for the motion, first, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome richard fisher. %$* 13
richard, you are the president and ceo of the federal reserve bank of dallas, a bank that texas monthly profiled in which it described dallas fed's, quote, "long tradition of being a pain in the-- %$* 13
" and a word beginning with "a"-- %$* 13
and how you are perhaps the most visible in a long line of dissidents from the bank. %$* 13
you have been often in disagreement with fed policy. %$* 13
so our question to you is in the ranking of fed policymakers, how much of a pain in the neck are you? %$* 13
first, thanks for getting it anatomically correct. %$* 253
of course, i'm a member of a team. %$* 253
we're just trying to get it right. %$* 253
we're trying to conduct monetary policy and regulatory policy in order to promote the greatest economic employment growth that possibly can be created without creating inflation. %$* 253
and this is an issue that's dear to our heart. %$* 253
ladies and gentlemen, richard fisher. %$* 13
and, richard, your partner is? %$* 13
my partner, simon johnson, is not only the former chief economist for the international monetary fund, he is also a brilliant professor at mit of entrepreneurialism and has a great british accent. %$* 253
ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it from simon johnson. %$* 13
and, simon, as former chief economist at the imf, you spent a lot of your career working on crisis prevention and growth issues in emerging markets, after which you said that while each crisis is different, they all look depressingly similar, including the crisis in the u.s. so what is the common denominator? %$* 13
oligarchs, rich powerful people who get out of control and they want you to bail them out again. %$* 254
and do you like them? %$* 13
well, we have to work with them, it seems. %$* 254
okay. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen-- %$* 13
simon johnson. %$* 13
motion is "break up the big banks," and we have two debaters here to argue against this motion. %$* 13
first, ladies and gentlemen, welcome douglas elliott. %$* 13
doug, you are a fellow in economic studies at the brookings institution. %$* 13
you were in investment banking for 20 years, most of it at jpmorgan. %$* 13
at one point you left banking and started up a nonprofit, which was called the center on federal financial institutions. %$* 13
after that you went back to banking, back to jpmorgan in 2006, just in time for the financial crisis, which says what about timing? %$* 13
it says i was broke. %$* 255
i was a volunteer think tanker. %$* 255
i needed to go back to wall street so i could support my think tank habit. %$* 255
ladies and gentlemen, doug elliott. %$* 13
and, doug, your partner is? %$* 13
the brilliant paul saltzman. %$* 255
he runs the clearinghouse association, which analyzes these issues. %$* 255
and he has a very nice brooklyn accent. %$* 255
ladies and gentlemen, paul saltzman. %$* 13
and, paul, as doug mentioned, you're president of the clearinghouse association where a while back you ran a sort of war game to test federal legislation that was put in place to manage banks called "dodd-frank." we'll be hearing a lot about it. %$* 13
and it simulated a bank meltdown, and you had people playing bankers and congressmen and journalists, et cetera, fdic folks; so i really want to know %$* 13
was your version of congress more functional than the one that we have now? %$* 13
well, no our version of congress functioned as well as the current congress, so i think it was very realistic and we had a number of folks who are in that field playing that and they were as fractious as today's current congress. %$* 256
so was it a disaster? %$* 13
yes. %$* 256
ladies and gentleman, paul saltzman. %$* 13
those are our four debaters. %$* 13
now, the way this works is that they will debate in three rounds and you, our live audience here, will choose the winner of the debate. %$* 13
by the time the arguments have concluded you will have been asked to vote twice, once before the debate and once again after the debate your sentiment on this motion. %$* 13
and the teams-- %$* 13
the team whose numbers have moved the most in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so, let's go to the preliminary vote. %$* 13
the first vote. %$* 13
if you go to the keypads at your seat, the way it works you push number one if you agree with the statement "break up the big banks," the side that's being argued by this team. %$* 13
if you disagree with this statement and you're with this team arguing against the motion, push number two. %$* 13
and if you're undecided push number three. %$* 13
if you push the wrong key, just correct yourself. %$* 13
the system will lock in your last vote and you can ignore the other keys. %$* 13
we’ll repeat this at the end of the debate and the turnaround time from that vote to giving the results and telling you who the winner is is about two minutes. %$* 13
okay, so we're going to lock that out. %$* 13
so, our motion is this: "break up the big banks." on to round one. %$* 13
opening statements from each of our debaters in turn. %$* 13
they have a seven-minute time limit. %$* 13
speaking first for the motion, "break up the big banks," richard fisher. %$* 13
he is the president and chief executive officer of the federal reserve bank of dallas. %$* 13
ladies and gentleman, richard fisher. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 253
thank you very much. %$* 253
when simon johnson and i speak of breaking up the big banks, we're speaking of less than a dozen banks that are considered, as you mentioned, “too big to fail”. let me just give you a statistic, 0.2 percent of all the banks in the united states of america control 70 percent of the banking assets of the country. %$* 253
one of them mentioned earlier by bob, jpmorgan, has assets that exceed the total assets of 5,400 community banks in this country. %$* 253
our definition of a bank “too big to fail” is a bank whose bond holders and shareholders and managers and big customers, even their oligarchs, believe themselves exempt from the rules and the consequences that apply to all others. %$* 253
if they screw up they'll be bailed out by you, the people in this audience, the american taxpayers. %$* 253
it happened in 2008, 2010.you know that. %$* 253
and then a law called dodd-frank was passed by congress to prevent it from ever happening again, and yet today these banks are bigger and the power more concentrated than ever. %$* 253
they are just as likely, they may even be more likely to take great risks in search of profits protected by the assumption that failure is an unlikely outcome and that taxpayers will once again come to their rescue. %$* 253
the mechanics to corral them are more politicized than ever. %$* 253
and even worse, dodd-frank, the legislation we just referred to, shackled smaller banks with over 13,000 pages of rules and regulations that as of last year we estimated would take 24,180,156 hours every single year to comply with and to implement. %$* 253
this places the smaller banks that wish to compete with the big banks at a tremendous competitive disadvantage. %$* 253
they don't have the resources to hire lawyers and handsome, well- heeled, brooklyn accented lobbyists like paul saltzman to work the regulators. %$* 253
under the law, the big banks are now designated as systemically important financial institutions. %$* 253
the acronym for that is sifis. %$* 253
now we, at the dallas fed and simon and i would consider the sifi an acronym for save if failure impending. %$* 253
and actually when you think about it, sifi sounds like a communicable disease. %$* 253
something that's transmitted by risky behavior and indeed-- %$* 253
thank you. %$* 253
i was waiting for that response. %$* 253
indeed it was the tbtf or the sifis who were, if not the cause of, they were the spreaders of the economic virus that nearly destroyed our economy in 2008-2010.that crisis, we estimate at the dallas fed, cost the united states over $15 trillion in output, output we have yet to regain. %$* 253
and if you do your numbers, you'll know that this is $120,000 per every american household. %$* 253
the sifis, the “too big to fail,” are a dagger pointed directly at the heart of the american economy. %$* 253
they threaten the well-being of everybody in in audience and everybody listening to this broadcast. %$* 253
so yes, simon johnson and i are advocates for breaking up the big banks that are considered “too big to fail”. our proposal is simple. %$* 253
we suggest that we limit any and all government guarantees to deposit-taking commercial banking operations of these large bank holding companies. %$* 253
we will let them operate their other businesses, but first prevent them by law from using your deposits and the governed guarantees for the safety of those guarantees from underwriting any of their other businesses. %$* 253
secondly, require anybody who is counterparty to their other business, which contracts with them on a risk transaction to sign a simple declaration that if this declaration fails-- %$* 253
if this transaction fails, we will never, ever be bailed out by the taxpayers of the united states. %$* 253
and, c, subject all those businesses to the regulations that such businesses are subject to when they're not protected by the banking laws that we currently have, that these big bank holding companies enjoy. %$* 253
for example, on derivatives, make sure they're subject to margin requirements, just like individuals are when they borrow money to buy a stock or a bond. %$* 253
and finally, insist on transparency. %$* 253
as bob pointed out, there's not much transparency. %$* 253
there's a lot of opaqueness, as it's called. %$* 253
the ceos of these businesses know where their risks are. %$* 253
if you're a sophisticated analyst, there's no way to determine that by looking at their balance sheet. %$* 253
and i would actually defy our noble opponents to tell me why what i've just suggested is an unworkable solution. %$* 253
and mr. %$* 253
saltzman and others are very fond of pointing out what they consider to be myths. %$* 253
one is that there is greater banking concentration in canada than in the united states, greater concentration in france than in the united states. %$* 253
that's great if you like gordon lightfoot, or if you're french. %$* 253
or they will point out that there are other industries that have a greater concentration, for example computers or telecoms, that's true. %$* 253
but these are companies that are not shielded from failure like banks are. %$* 253
they receive no subsidies from the implied guarantees that the government currently provides them, currently provides the bankers to shield them from failure. %$* 253
winston churchill once said that in finance everything that is agreeable is unsound, and everything that is sound is disagreeable. %$* 253
i know that what simon johnson and i propose is disagreeable to the highly paid lobbyists and spokesmen of the “too big to fail” big banks. %$* 253
but it is the sound thing to do. %$* 253
the big banks, in summary, have taken what i call the immoral high ground. %$* 253
government policy has led them there, and it has enshrined them. %$* 253
we need to correct this perversion of american capitalism. %$* 253
it may not be the french thing to do, but it's the american thing to do, and i think we should do so. %$* 253
so i ask you to vote yes to the proposition before this house. %$* 253
let us break up the banks, the big banks that are considered “too big to fail”. thank you. %$* 253
thank you, richard fisher. %$* 13
our motion is "break up the big banks." and here to speak against this motion, i'd like to introduce paul saltzman. %$* 13
he is president of the clearing house association, a trade group that represents 18 of the world's largest banks. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, paul saltzman. %$* 13
thank you, john. %$* 256
seven years after the subprime mortgage crisis, one thing is clear. %$* 256
many people made serious mistakes; public officials, regulators and, yes, simon and richard, large banks. %$* 256
mistakes that we now know with the benefit of hindsight helped bring about the crisis. %$* 256
but in the three years since the passage of the dodd frank financial reform act, there has been an intense focus on strengthening our banking system. %$* 256
there are new rules and supervisory practices that are changing both the culture and the structure of large banks in permanent and transformational ways to ensure that a crisis like the one we experienced never happens again. %$* 256
but my opponents ignore or understate these reforms. %$* 256
instead, they propose a radical, untested, and practically unworkable experiment that would upend the progress we have made and create a whole host of new systemic crises. %$* 256
my opponents' proposal would forcibly break up the largest big banks by placing an arbitrary cap, a government imposed-- %$* 256
the same government that can't seem to get its act together with respect to the payment of our debt. %$* 256
this unprecedented abuse of government power attempts to address an ill-defined risk with little regard for its practical implications or its unintended consequences, simply because they think smaller banks are inherently safer. %$* 256
that is their underlying assumption. %$* 256
and they are selling you this solution as a risk-free proposition without any cost to society. %$* 256
yes, we can have all the benefits of large banks, but we don't need the large banks. %$* 256
i'm afraid, simon and richard, you just can't have it both ways. %$* 256
their solution is naive and nostalgic. %$* 256
yes, we all yearn for a simpler world. %$* 256
i get it. %$* 256
but when america and the world become less interconnected and simpler, when large and small companies become less global and stop being the mainstay of production, consumer innovation, and choice, then let's have this debate. %$* 256
look, the strengths of our banking system is its diversity. %$* 256
we need banks of all sizes, shapes and functions. %$* 256
and yes, within that mosaic, some banks are large, quite large. %$* 256
but some of these banks are large for a simple reason. %$* 256
they mirror the size and the scope of the economy that they serve. %$* 256
they are scaled to serve the customers and the companies that voluntarily use their services. %$* 256
large banks provide a unique set of services. %$* 256
global distribution channels, innovative technologies that only they can produce because of the economies of size, scope and scale at cheaper prices for american consumers. %$* 256
some of these benefits are visible, like mobile payment technologies and reward points. %$* 256
some are very much behind the scenes like fraud protection and massive investment for our global infrastructure, clearance, settlement and payment systems. %$* 256
and large banks spend tens of billions of dollars protecting this critical market infrastructure from dangerous cyber-attacks that small banks could not afford to pay. %$* 256
and some benefits are indeed difficult to quantify, but that doesn't make them any less valuable, like the breadth of services that they provide to smaller banks as correspondents as operational support and corporations large and small that allow for multicurrency channels, trade finance, global cash management and other risk management tools. %$* 256
look, several realities will be debated tonight, realities which i submit can't reasonably be refuted, although my worthy opponents certainly will attempt to do so. %$* 256
first, we do have to put things in perspective. %$* 256
some of america's banks are indeed large. %$* 256
but we have to view them relative to the size of our economy and the world economy that we live in. %$* 256
the size of the american banking system is proportional to the economy that it serves. %$* 256
our banking system as a percentage of our economy is basically the equivalent of south africa's. %$* 256
in addition, as richard mentioned-- %$* 256
i know he was appealing to isolationist tendencies there, but the fact of the matter is the degree of concentration in our banking system is in fact less than most developed countries. %$* 256
the largest banks, as a percentage of industry revenue, are in fact less than most other industries with fixed costs, including auto manufacturing computers, pharmaceuticals and wireless telecom. %$* 256
second, the underlying premise of my opponents' theory is that smaller banks are somehow safer and less complex. %$* 256
that is a faulty assumption that is simply belied by the facts of history. %$* 256
banking crises are caused by one thing: when too many people buy an overinflated asset, you have what's called a common shock, a common shock associated with too many people buying the same overvalued asset. %$* 256
and when that asset bubble bursts, you have a systemic crisis. %$* 256
my point is, smaller institutions, whether they are banks or hedge funds, can be a source of systemic risk. %$* 256
they have been, and unfortunately, they will be. %$* 256
breaking up the banks will not prevent a future crisis. %$* 256
and also, they would eliminate the stabilizing impact that large and well diversified banks have during times of inevitable crises. %$* 256
and third, and perhaps an area that we'd love to mix it up during the course of the debate, new laws are in place that weren't in place, including the law that prohibits taxpayer bailouts and eliminates “too big to fail”. %$* 256
and there has been tremendous progress in the pace and substance of regulatory reforms to mitigate the risks to our banking system. %$* 256
to ignore or understate these transformational changes is disingenuous. %$* 256
there isn't a single aspect of a bank's business that hasn't undergone-- %$* 256
been untouched, undergone reform or been untouched by regulatory reform. %$* 256
banks have twice as much capital as they had before the crisis. %$* 256
liquidity gaps are closed even in advance of regulation. %$* 256
bankruptcy road maps, through living wills are in place that make organizations simpler and less complex. %$* 256
and we have a new bankruptcy process that requires banks to be resolved without taxpayer support. %$* 256
to suggest that these changes are illusory is just simply wrong. %$* 256
they are in place. %$* 256
they are effectively limiting both the likelihood the large banks fail and the impact of that failure if and when it does occur. %$* 256
the answer presented by these risks is not to ignore the benefits that large banks bring to our society, but to continue to focus on improving the macro-prudential regulatory framework, to periodically assess their effectiveness, and to think about where the next crisis is coming from. %$* 256
thank you. %$* 256
paul saltzman, i'm sorry, your time is up, and thank you very much. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 256
ladies and gentlemen, paul saltzman. %$* 13
and here's where we are, we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donovan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, fighting it out over this motion, "break up the big banks." you have heard two of the opening statements, and now on to the third. %$* 13
arguing for the motion, "break up the big banks," simon johnson. %$* 13
he is the ronald a.kurtz professor of entrepreneurship at the mit sloan school of management and former chief economist at the international monetary fund. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, simon johnson. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 254
and thank you, paul and doug, for being willing to come out and argue the big banks' corner this evening. %$* 254
this debate is long overdue. %$* 254
now, richard fisher has laid out for you the case, the economic case, the technical case for breaking up the big banks. %$* 254
and, now, you should take note of what he says. %$* 254
he's the president of the dallas fed. %$* 254
he's a man with a great deal of experience in financial markets. %$* 254
he's also a man who has to be, you understand, somewhat careful about certain statements he makes, wouldn't want to move the dollar or anything in a precipitous manner. %$* 254
my job today is to tell you the things that richard fisher can't tell you-- %$* 254
because he's too nice a guy and too much of a diplomat. %$* 254
and a lot of these things are about politics, and i want to cover these precisely by responding to what paul saltzman has just said on three main dimensions. %$* 254
i want to talk about the magic-- %$* 254
supposed magic of banking. %$* 254
i want to talk about jpmorgan chase, the biggest bank in the world. %$* 254
and i want to talk about dodd-frank, the legislation; the miracle that mr. %$* 254
saltzman says has fixed all our problems. %$* 254
now, on the first one, on the magic of big banks, have you felt it? %$* 254
have you seen around you as the banks became bigger the great improvement in customer service; the reduction in fees; the better access to credit for all americans? %$* 254
no, no, you have not. %$* 254
you have not. %$* 254
and the really-- %$* 254
the really interesting point-- %$* 254
and i'm afraid the sleight of hand, and it's a masterful sleight of hand-- %$* 254
in what mr. %$* 254
saltzman said is the history. %$* 254
when did the banks in the united states become so big? %$* 254
it wasn't 50 years ago. %$* 254
it wasn't 30 years ago. %$* 254
it's mostly in the last 15 years. %$* 254
mid-1990s, the largest six banks in the united states had total assets around 15 percent, 1-5 percent of u.s.gdp.they're now over 60 percent of gdp, combined. %$* 254
they're bigger now than they were before the crisis. %$* 254
this is a recent development. %$* 254
all-- %$* 254
everyone in this room, everyone listening and watching at home should have felt the magic if there were any magic for you. %$* 254
there isn't. %$* 254
there's magic, all right, there's magic in compensation. %$* 254
if you run a bigger bank, you get a bigger paycheck. %$* 254
you understand what that's about. %$* 254
there is no magic of size for the consumer, for the broader economy, for the nonfinancial sector. %$* 254
let's talk about numbers. %$* 254
let's talk about-- %$* 254
let me talk about jpmorgan chase. %$* 254
i don't see jamie dimon the room. %$* 254
he could speak for himself if he is here. %$* 254
we haven't-- %$* 254
nobody said anything about the numbers, the size. %$* 254
what is the balance sheet-- %$* 254
total balance sheet measured properly? %$* 254
include all the derivative exposure using international accounting standards. %$* 254
it's a $4 trillion bank. %$* 254
it's about a quarter the size of the u.s.economy. %$* 254
i'm comparing the balance sheet with our annual gdp.that's a big bank. %$* 254
if jpmorgan were on the verge of failure today, a wednesday, it's an awkward day for banks, though-- %$* 254
i think one of the big lessons actually from the clearing house simulation was "don't fail on a tuesday." it's a long way from tuesday to the weekend. %$* 254
we need to get to the weekend. %$* 254
do the bailout. %$* 254
right? %$* 254
it's a wednesday. %$* 254
it's wednesday, it's an awkward day, i understand. %$* 254
it's an awkward day. %$* 254
jpmorgan, $4 trillion is going down. %$* 254
it's a hypothetical. %$* 254
please don't rush to tweet that. %$* 254
it's hypothetical. %$* 254
jpmorgan is about to fail. %$* 254
who here thinks that the president, secretary to the treasury, chairman of the federal reserve would let them go? %$* 254
let them fail? %$* 254
take the hit? %$* 254
go through bankruptcy? %$* 254
does anyone think jpmorgan could fail just like every other business outside of big banks could fail in america? %$* 254
could jpmorgan fail? %$* 254
anyone want to raise their hand? %$* 254
paul, you can raise your hand if you want. %$* 254
anyway, goldman sachs. %$* 254
goldman sachs. %$* 254
goldman sachs was a $1.1 trillion bank when it failed. %$* 254
i'm sorry, was rescued by liquidity loans. %$* 254
i always get those two things mixed up. %$* 254
in september 2008, $1.1 trillion bank. %$* 254
that was up from $250 billion in the mid-1990s when it was one of the best banks in the world, when it provided really good service to individuals and corporate customers. %$* 254
one of the best banks in the world. %$* 254
it became a lot bigger. %$* 254
it became $1.1 trillion. %$* 254
anyone think goldman sachs could fail. %$* 254
no. %$* 254
i see no hands. %$* 254
one hand. %$* 254
good luck to you, sir. %$* 254
there is a short seller in every new york audience. %$* 254
dodd-frank, mr. %$* 254
saltzman says, dodd-frank has solved this problem. %$* 254
now, i'm a supporter of dodd-frank. %$* 254
i think this is important legislation. %$* 254
we had to get some of those reforms done. %$* 254
i worked to help the fdic, federal deposit insurance corporation, with their implementation of some of the plans for how you manage the collapse of these banks. %$* 254
yes, i'm a member of the systemic advisory committee for the fdic.it's a great, fun job. %$* 254
i can assure you. %$* 254
we have terrific parties. %$* 254
and, you know, maybe, maybe it'll work. %$* 254
maybe the single point of entry, the recapitalization of the holding company, maybe they'll be enough capital. %$* 254
maybe the federal reserve will insist on preparing these banks properly so when the day comes the damage is more to the management who are responsible and to the creditors who should be on the hook, and to their shareholders who took the risk rather than on the rest of us, rather than on the economy, rather than on the taxpayer, rather than on everyone who lost a job. %$* 254
eight million jobs lost, $15 trillion in output. %$* 254
dennis kelleher from better markets in the second row has the same numbers from his independent assessment. %$* 254
this is a calamity. %$* 254
maybe we could avert that danger. %$* 254
maybe dodd-frank will work and all these pieces will come together. %$* 254
i would not bet on that. %$* 254
i do not advise you to bet on it. %$* 254
i advise you not to take risk out of the world. %$* 254
you can't do that. %$* 254
we have no magic bullets. %$* 254
there are no panaceas, but as a matter of responsible action, as a matter of dealing with the problems that confront you, as a matter of reducing the risks that we will face, i urge you today support the motion put forward by richard fisher and me, "break up the big banks." thank you very much. %$* 254
thank you, simon johnson. %$* 13
and that's our motion: "break up the big banks," and here is our final debater speaking against the motion, douglas elliott. %$* 13
doug elliott is a fellow in economic studies at the brookings institution and a former investment banker. %$* 13
ladies and gentleman, doug elliott. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 255
thank you, john, and thank you all for being here. %$* 255
i have to deviate slightly from my prepared notes here, from the sleight of hand comment. %$* 255
my-- %$* 255
the sleight of hand i noticed is they seem to either not be making the same proposal or they seem not to be clear on what the proposal is. %$* 255
my understanding was this was about breaking up the big banks, which i think most of us here, certainly paul and i assumed, was to break them into pieces, many pieces, not-- %$* 255
to bring them down below a certain size level, not to do what sounds like a variant of glass-steagall. %$* 255
simon himself didn't describe what he thinks should be done. %$* 255
he described what he doesn't like about the current situation. %$* 255
i'm sure later they'll have a chance to explain what they actually mean and if they both mean the same thing. %$* 255
taking this the way i think we were supposed to, i strongly believe it would be a big mistake to forcibly break up the largest american banks. %$* 255
i oppose breaking them up for three main reasons. %$* 255
first, as paul has pointed out, we need some very large complex banks in america to cost effectively help our businesses and families deal with a large, complex world. %$* 255
without them, loans and other services will be more expensive and harder to get. %$* 255
second, breaking up the big banks is unlikely to make us safer, despite the assertions of richard and simon. %$* 255
third, the process of breaking the banks up would almost certainly cut bank lending for a number of years at a time when our economy needs more lending, not less. %$* 255
starting with the role of big banks, i think paul explained quite well. %$* 255
what we need in america is an ecosystem of finance in which there are many different types of organizations that are thriving; big banks, small banks, insurance companies, many other types of participants. %$* 255
among those i submit that we do need some very large banks, primarily to serve our largest companies, and even middle sized companies, that need a very wide range of financial services, need them in many locations, including overseas, and need them to be provided at a scale that allows it to be cost effective so they're not excessively priced. %$* 255
this means, when you add this up, we do need some that are quite large. %$* 255
and i would think if they have a criterion, would cross the criterion that they-- %$* 255
my opponents would feel-- %$* 255
meant they should be broken up. %$* 255
and this isn't just my opinion. %$* 255
the business roundtable did a survey of ceos of major u.s.companies, and they very strongly supported the need for banks of this nature. %$* 255
now, richard has his federal reserve bank in dallas, which does some nice research for him. %$* 255
but i'm sorry, richard, i happen to be more impressed by research papers from two other federal reserve banks in st. %$* 255
louis and in philadelphia, that have shown quite considerable benefits of this kind of size and scope to quite large levels, that these provide many benefits to society to allow the services to be provided at a reasonable cost without which loans and other services would become more expensive. %$* 255
i also wouldn't want to see us tie our hands in international competition. %$* 255
now, let me go to my point on no increase in safety, because i don't actually believe that what they're describing would make us safer, even though perhaps in that churchillian approach, it sounds agreeable to do this, to break up the big banks-- %$* 255
we all seem to hate bankers-- %$* 255
but it's not actually the right way to go. %$* 255
now, think about why it-- %$* 255
what would be different. %$* 255
let's say ten years ago, if we had broken up the big banks into 20 pieces each, i don't think much would have been different in the crisis that we had. %$* 255
it would have been severe, it would have happened, and the character wouldn't have been that much different, because these smaller banks that they were broken up into would all have gone the same way, that is, they all would have overinvested in mortgages, both residential and commercial. %$* 255
now, why do i say that? %$* 255
one, because at the time, almost everybody thought this was smart business. %$* 255
so almost all the players in the financial sector were doing it. %$* 255
secondly, you can look at what small and medium sized banks did. %$* 255
the ones who actually existed that are supposed by safer, they took on tremendous risk and got hurt quite badly. %$* 255
they were just smaller, so they didn't, each one of them, make the headlines. %$* 255
smaller size was no protection from risky and ultimately stupid decisions. %$* 255
richard and simon imply that smaller banks will take less risk. %$* 255
i don't see it. %$* 255
i don't see it from the incentive structure, and i don't see it from how they actually operated. %$* 255
put another way, breaking up the big banks would not have affected any of the principal factors that analysts tend to argue caused the financial crisis. %$* 255
they wouldn't have affected excessive investment in all types of mortgages, reduced standards for those mortgages, government pressure and encouragement to make risky mortgage loans, lacks regulation, poor practices at the rating agencies, a bad bonus culture, excessive risk taking by some individuals and the incentives that existed to create dodgy securitizations. %$* 255
so i don't see why we'd expect it to be safer. %$* 255
now, you might say, well, we wouldn't have to do a rescue as taxpayers if these were smaller banks. %$* 255
but we saw, in the savings and loan crisis-- %$* 255
that we had to do that. %$* 255
if i had more time, i would talk more about this. %$* 255
but you may be surprised that paul krugman, no friend of the banks, agrees with us. %$* 255
he said, "breaking up big banks wouldn't really solve our problems, because it's perfectly possible to have a financial crisis that mainly takes the form of a run on smaller banks."in fact, that's precisely what happened in the 1930s. %$* 255
and if i had more time, i'd give you the rest of the quote. %$* 255
i can do that later if you want. %$* 255
but let me move on to the conclusion here. %$* 255
keep in mind, richard and simon are selling you a theory. %$* 255
we have no actual experience of breaking up the big banks in this way in advanced economies. %$* 255
they cannot promise success. %$* 255
and i personally believe it will do considerable harm. %$* 255
the economy will be less efficient, credit more expensive. %$* 255
we'll be less competitive globally, and i don't see an increase in overall safety. %$* 255
thank you. %$* 255
doug elliott, thank you very much. %$* 13
and that concludes round one of this intelligence squared u.s.debate where our motion is "break up the big banks." keep in mind how you voted at the beginning of the evening, because as i said before, we're going to have you vote again at the end of the evening to tell us where you stand on this motion after hearing the arguments. %$* 13
and the team that has changed the most minds in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. %$* 13
now onto round two. %$* 13
and round two is where the debaters address each other directly and answer questions from you in the audience and from me. %$* 13
we have two teams of two arguing for and against the motion, "break up the big banks." arguing for breaking up the big banks, richard fisher and simon johnson who are arguing that we're in uncharted territory in terms of the size of the small number of banks that control the assets of an enormous amounts of money that they didn't have 15 years ago; that the government protections that allow them to operate without fear of failure, without bailout represents a moral hazard; the fact that they are shielded from failure is a moral hazard that needs to be remedied. %$* 13
the team arguing against the motion, doug elliott and paul saltzman argue that the bigness of the banks is not the key issue here, that in the financial crisis we all went through a few years ago, there were many, many factors involved. %$* 13
and big banks, while they made mistakes, were only part of that problem, that breaking up the banks, these big banks would be a dangerous and unworkable experiment, and that basically big business needs big banks. %$* 13
and if we want to be global, we have to have banks that are global as well. %$* 13
i want to go to the team that's arguing against the motion to come back to this term, “too big to fail”," which your opponents embrace. %$* 13
that's, in fact, the core of their argument is that there are banks that are “too big to fail”, and failure would be catastrophic. %$* 13
i just want clarity from the side arguing against the motion. %$* 13
do you believe that there are banks that are “too big to fail”, whose failure would indeed be catastrophic? %$* 13
paul saltzman. %$* 13
doug, let me take that. %$* 256
so let me just be very clear from the outset. %$* 256
no bank should be “too big to fail”.no company should be “too big to fail”.companies, whether they be banks or other financial institutions, need to suffer the risks of their own risky behavior. %$* 256
it's as simple as that. %$* 256
here, here. %$* 255
okay. %$* 256
so i think we're not debating-- %$* 256
you know, and to characterize my position or the industry position as being supportive of moral hazard risk is just misleading. %$* 256
so let's just-- %$* 256
let's just be perfectly clear. %$* 256
but, paul, to my question, does that mean that you do feel that there's a scale of a bank where its failure would indeed be catastrophic? %$* 13
with dodd frank and the law as it is today, which prohibits bailouts, with banks getting smaller and less complex through the living wills process, through the new bankruptcy process that allows banks to be resolved in a way without taxpayers’ support. %$* 256
no bank is “too big to fail”. %$* 256
i don't mean to harangue you on this question. %$* 13
i think maybe i'm not being quite clear. %$* 13
i'm actually asking for a hypothetical this way. %$* 13
and i understand you're saying that you don't think jpmorgan would go down the way things are set up now. %$* 13
my question is really different. %$* 13
hypothetically, if jpmorgan went down, would that be catastrophic for the economy? %$* 13
jpmorgan can be successfully resolved under the current law and would not need to be bailed out. %$* 256
okay. %$* 13
don't ask me. %$* 256
ask paul tucker, deputy governor, ask ben bernanke, ask mary miller, ask many of the other public officials that have indicated large banks can be successfully resolved under the current law. %$* 256
let's go to the other side, simon johnson. %$* 13
well, i've asked paul tucker. %$* 254
paul tucker is the outgoing deputy governor of the bank of england. %$* 254
and this is a key issue for the british, because it's a cross-border banking issue. %$* 254
it's incredibly complex. %$* 254
ask paul tucker this question, can-- %$* 254
specifically this question: can jpmorgan chase be resolved under some combination of dodd-frank and what the british have in place? %$* 254
and what he says is, “well, we don't quite have the british piece in place yet.” i actually think that to american english the answer's no. %$* 254
simon, with all due respect, maybe i was at a different meeting. %$* 256
for the record, we'd like to get that quote. %$* 256
paul tucker said emphatically that large banks can be successfully resolved under the current law. %$* 256
maybe i was in a different meeting. %$* 256
well, what's so interesting to me is the bank of england is putting forward proposals right now to ring fence the commercial banking operations of complex bank holding companies exactly as i have just proposed. %$* 253
that comes from paul tucker. %$* 253
that comes from andrew haldane that comes from the bank of england. %$* 253
so there is a difference of view here, and-- %$* 253
well, but besides the-- %$* 18
the most-- %$* 256
if we’re citing the bank of england, paul, then as authorities we should take the-- %$* 254
we should just take onboard their evidence. %$* 254
and, doug, on your point today, are there economies of scale and scope in banking, andy haldane and his team say there are only such magic for banks if you ignore the subsidy the “too big to fail” banks receive, if you factor in that subsidy all those nice results that you mentioned go away. %$* 254
so let's decide where we are in the bank of england. %$* 254
are they an authority on this, or are they wrong on the evidence? %$* 254
doug elliott. %$* 13
first of all, i talk with andy haldane a lot, and what his actual view is, is a lot more subtle than you just described, but i'd like to go back also, you were invoking the vickers commission and what the british are doing. %$* 255
what the british are doing as i think you know is actually very similar to what we still have under the parts of glass-steagall that we never got rid of, which is there are protections under current u.s. law that mean that deposit taking banks have a number of transactions they cannot do with their non- bank-- %$* 255
their securities affiliates. %$* 255
that's pretty much what they're talking about doing in the-- %$* 255
with the vickers commission, not talking about going dramatically further than that. %$* 255
i think we-- %$* 253

but the previous administration didn't. %$* 541
now, you know, the u.s.is back in the mainstream. %$* 541
we didn't need to pull out of kyoto. %$* 541
we could have consulted. %$* 541
and there are all sorts of other issues, free flow of technology, things that are very much in our interest where, if we go it alone, other people aren't just-- %$* 541
aren't going to go along with us. %$* 541
interesting point that you bring up. %$* 13
i want to bring it to the other side, that you're arguing that the expansion, let's say, the opposite of clipping wings, the laissez-faire attitude towards wings, leaving the wings alone, they're actually saying that your argument for power actually might reduce american influence and power. %$* 13
i don't think that-- %$* 544
once again, there are hundreds of millions of people around the world who rely on american power for their safety. %$* 544
i mentioned, for example, the view eliot mentioned it again, the japanese. %$* 544
but you made that point before. %$* 13
i-- %$* 13
but elliott, can you tell-- %$* 13
to their point that they're saying that there's a diminished-- %$* 13
more than diminished returns, that the expression of power-- %$* 13
is a weaker-- %$* 544
is diminishing u.s. influence %$* 13
a weaker american military is going to hurt the influence of this country. %$* 544
another thing that's going to hurt the influence of this country is if we are fiscally irresponsible, and we are broke, and we are borrowing billions and billions of dollars. %$* 544
but i don't know what else i can do except to quote all those wonderful clinton officials who say it isn't the military budget that is exploding. %$* 544
it is the entitlements that are exploding. %$* 544
nobody wants to hear that, but it's a fact. %$* 544
and we have to deal with it. %$* 544
least of all, do politicians in washington want to hear it. %$* 544
that's what we need to deal with to make our economy sound. %$* 544
sir down in the second row. %$* 13
i have a question for the elliotts, both spellings. %$* 18
and i just don't want to one word answer here. %$* 18
in your unclipped and unclippable world, do you think we should send ground troops into libya? %$* 18
after all, we want him gone, and it will save lives. %$* 18
i guess my own view on libya is actually we should have pushed a lot harder when gaddafi was falling. %$* 542
if the president is going to say that it's our objective to get rid of him, that we better be very serious, i don't think we have to commit ground forces in the sense of, you know, infantry brigades. %$* 542
i do think if you want those-- %$* 542
the rebel forces to succeed on the ground, you probably need to send in the kind of special forces that we have who are good at kind of training and developing local forces, which is sort of what we did to the taliban. %$* 542
and my guess is that would be enough. %$* 542
if you're also willing to commit the air power to it as well. %$* 542
it's a nato operation, by the way, as is afghanistan i have to point out. %$* 542
we've gone it alone. %$* 542
i visited german soldiers, british soldiers, canadian soldiers, norwegian soldiers, for that matter, new zealanders, australians and danes in afghanistan. %$* 542
okay. %$* 13
let me-- %$* 13
let me get the question to lawrence korb about libya. %$* 13
would you-- %$* 13
no. %$* 543
and i think basically obama did it exactly right. %$* 543
the cost to put ground troops on there was too great. %$* 543
the cost to the american defense budget and the taxpayer in terms of doing it all by ourselves was too great. %$* 543
so basically, this operation after the first week is costing us $40 million a month. %$* 543
basically, that's affordable. %$* 543
how much is afghanistan costing? %$* 543
how much is iraq costing? %$* 543
that's what i'm talking about, you've got to do the - - you know, do the cost benefits. %$* 543
and he decided that, yes, we would like gaddafi to be gone. %$* 543
every-- %$* 543
we'd like a lot of these people to be gone. %$* 543
but in terms of the cost to do that, it would-- %$* 543
to put ground troops on and all that was just too great. %$* 543
and i think we have actually moved away in our military strategy the way we were doing it in yemen with the special forces and the drones, the way we're doing it in pakistan and the drones. %$* 543
that is a cost benefit way to do it rather than sending in large numbers of ground troops. %$* 543
another question? %$* 13
yes, ma'am, your-- %$* 13
yeah, yeah, yeah. %$* 13
emphatic. %$* 13
hi. %$* 19
i visited the islamic republic of iran 10 days before their election in 2009, their presidential election, on vacation. %$* 19
and i've been writing about iran ever since then, partly in dismay of what happened with their presidential election and the crackdown. %$* 19
in terms of china and-- %$* 19
but can-- %$* 13
of u.s. and iran-- %$* 19
is this your question coming? %$* 13
yes. %$* 19
it is now, just to give you background. %$* 19
so i'm writing mostly for an iranian audience, actually, so you might want to speak of that when you're also answering too. %$* 19
china-- %$* 19
china is buying a lot of u.s.bonds. %$* 19
and that's part of how we're financing our military. %$* 19
so when we use a lot of military, we do go further into debt. %$* 19
i think it's important-- %$* 19
do you-- %$* 19
do you also think it's important to not underestimate cultural wars or soft wars because the iranians are very focused also on that, like they're very afraid of facebook and youtube. %$* 19
the state department has-- %$* 19
all right. %$* 13
i think i see your question. %$* 13
you're using other weapons, softer weapons, for example. %$* 13
i'm assuming both sides are in favor of that. %$* 13
it's cost effective. %$* 13
we need to do more of it. %$* 18
we need to do it more intelligently. %$* 18
and i would ask a question back to you. %$* 13
do you think those demonstrators in the streets of tehran, who exposed themselves to what they got would be voting in favor of this proposition. %$* 13
there's a combination of iranians that are inside and outside of iran. %$* 19
but the ones that are inside, there are a lot of them that are in jail now unfortunately because they've all been arrested. %$* 19
but also there have been a lot of revolutions in the middle east, and they had a lot to do with people not having good jobs and so on and so forth. %$* 19
but to his question, do you think that the-- %$* 13
that the-- %$* 13
those who are standing up against these regimes would be discouraged to hear an argument that america needs its global wings clipped, or would they find that understandable and acceptable and realistic? %$* 13
the people i know who are involved in-- %$* 19
that actually do live inside of iran, and i'm in contact with probably about a hundred people inside iran now, and many of them were protesters. %$* 19
i don't-- %$* 19
from what i hear from them, they're not thinking that a military invasion would really be a good idea. %$* 19
okay. %$* 13
and that's-- %$* 19
but they're not happy with the position that they're in. %$* 19
so if there are other ways to sort of balance the power so that-- %$* 19
or other ways to show a good example of government's-- %$* 19
okay, ma'am, i just need to get to some other questions. %$* 13
but i think you should get a chair on our next debate on iran, on the stage. %$* 13
thank you very much for bringing it up. %$* 13
sir, in the front row. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13
third row. %$* 13
my apologies. %$* 13
my question is, if we clip america's wings, how do we combat radical islam? %$* 18
and if we expand our global wings, how do we combat radical islam because we-- %$* 18
you know – it’s growing-- %$* 18
you know what? %$* 13
take a minute-- %$* 13
take 15 seconds longer and decode what your point is. %$* 13
you're saying it's a no-win situation either way? %$* 13
well, i just want to hear how do we combat it on either end of the debate. %$* 18
okay. %$* 13
first to this side for a more modest policy. %$* 13
well, here is the problem. %$* 541
we have this huge investment in afghanistan which is because, as actually happened, the september 11th tax began there. %$* 541
however, we're not really-- %$* 541
we're not fighting al-qaeda there. %$* 541
we're fighting a pashtun insurgency. %$* 541
al-qaeda is now present in pakistan, somalia, yemen and probably certainly more present in probably in europe than it is-- %$* 541
but to his question, are you-- %$* 13
in afghanistan. %$* 18
and so the misallocation of resources by this kind of expansive nation-building mission is diverting us from dealing with iraq. %$* 18
his question-- %$* 13
his question is about another world in which going forward, if we're going to have to make hard choices, he's asking would a world operating under those rules be able to confront radical islam. %$* 13
lawrence, do you want to take it? %$* 13
yeah. %$* 543
you've got to confront these violent extremists basically not by killing them. %$* 543
rumsfeld said you can't kill all the terrorists. %$* 543
basically, what you have to do is undermine their narrative. %$* 543
and by going into iraq, which turned out to be for the wrong reasons, you enhance the al-qaeda narrative. %$* 543
and so i think what we have to do is live up to our values at home, and that will help. %$* 543
i mean, peter was talking about the fact that the american opinion around the world has gone up. %$* 543
that's important. %$* 543
that's how you're going-- %$* 543
you're not going to be able to kill them all. %$* 543
you have to undermine their narrative. %$* 543
you know the american opinion in the muslim world went up when we-- %$* 543
after we helped the people in indonesia. %$* 543
but how does that relate to a more modest exertion of power? %$* 13
well, it means you don't use your military to do it. %$* 543
it's basically you live at home-- %$* 543
because it's counterproductive and makes enemies. %$* 13
is that what your argument is? %$* 13
it can make enemies? %$* 13
that's what you're saying has happened in iraq, afghanistan. %$* 13
yes, yes, i am saying that, yeah. %$* 543
okay. %$* 13
let me take it to the other side. %$* 13
well, i'm-- %$* 18
let elliott finish. %$* 18
which elliott will take this? %$* 13
eliot cohen. %$* 13
well, i guess my first thought is, a moment ago you were all in favor of targeted killing in pakistan and yemen, so, i mean, that’s-- %$* 542
i’m in favor of living up to our ideals at home, but you were in favor of drones, let’s remember what those drones do. %$* 542
secondly, i very much believe in american soft power, and that’s what we should be exercising to the best we can in places that are likely to be the incubators of radical islam, that means being more involved in places like indonesia to take just one case, rather than less. %$* 542
i mean, again, remember what this proposition’s about. %$* 542
this is not a debate about the use of military power; it’s about america’s global role. %$* 542
i would just add here, you know, living up to our ideals at home is not going to end the threat of islamic extremism. %$* 544
one of our ideals at home is equality for women, and the more we live up to that, the more they’re going to hate us because they don’t believe in it. %$* 544
so that is not a solution. %$* 544
i think there is a one solution, but a key part of it as eliot just said, is what we do in those countries. %$* 544
i can’t think of a better thing to do than support the expansion of democracy through soft power, not by invading 15 countries, but i think that what is happening now in the middle east with the arab revolts, is just killing al-qaeda because we see what people in those countries want, they want democracy, they want free elections, they want an end to censorship and the secret police, and al-qaeda isn’t even addressing any of those things. %$* 544
so the expansion of democracy in the arab world is one of the best things we can do to fight al-qaeda. %$* 544
and how does-- %$* 13
how do we do that with the use of american force? %$* 13
you’re not going to do it-- %$* 544
you do it with soft power mostly, but it is harder to make your soft power felt if people think that your country is in decline and your wings are being clipped. %$* 544
that’s just the nature of the world. %$* 544
and that concludes round two of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
here’s where we are. %$* 13
you are about to hear brief closing statements from each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be two minutes each, and remember, you voted before the debate on your view on this motion, and we’re going to ask you to vote once again afterwards. %$* 13
this is their last chance to try to change your minds. %$* 13
so, round three, closing statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
our motion is, “it’s time to clip america’s global wings.” and here to summarize his position against the motion, eliot cohen, professor at the school of advanced international studies at johns hopkins university and former counselor at the department of state. %$* 13
our opponents would have liked the motion to be resolved, the bush administration acted like a bunch of arrogant, wasteful, strategic nincompoops in iraq and afghanistan, but that wasn’t the topic. %$* 542
i mean, i turned down a topic that i thought was pretty silly. %$* 542
the topic is, “it’s time to clip america’s global wings." you know, you can’t assess these things as if they were some sort of scientific proof, they’re not, but let me offer one way of thinking about it, and one way of formulating your judgments. %$* 542
who in the world would be likely to vote for this resolution, who would be likely to vote against it? %$* 542
so here's some of the people in my list who would vote for it. %$* 542
i think vladimir putin would vote for it, i think kim jong-il would vote for it, i think mr. %$* 542
chávez in venezuela would vote for it, and i think-- %$* 542
i am sure president ahmadinejad would vote for it. %$* 542
who would vote against it? %$* 542
prime minister salam fayyad of the palestinian authority, and prime minister bibi netanyahu of israel, aung san suu kyi in burma, and i suspect the dalai lama, those demonstrators in the streets of tehran that we talked about, the kurds, the kosovars, the bosniaks, the people of japan, of australia, kenya, columbia, darfur. %$* 542
i know which group of people i’d rather be with. %$* 542
thank you. %$* 13
eliot cohen, speaking against the motion, which is, “it’s time to clip america’s global wings.” and here to summarize his position for the motion, peter galbraith, a former u.s. diplomat who served as deputy special representative of the u.n. and afghanistan and was the first u.s. ambassador to croatia. %$* 13
in an op-ed piece in the washington post on sunday, meghan o’sullivan, who was an official in the bush administration, wrote about lessons of libya that came from iraq. %$* 541
and one of them was that she said, “early decisions can have long term consequences." in effect, we made a big mistake deciding that iraq would have a federal system. %$* 541
well, guess what, it wasn’t america’s decision to be made. %$* 541
it had been made a decade before by the iraqis, and that really comes to my point. %$* 541
this world, it’s not all about us. %$* 541
it’s about-- %$* 541
what’s happening in the middle east is not because they sat down and they read jefferson or the federalist papers. %$* 541
it is an indigenous movement of people in the arab world, and it’s terrific. %$* 541
but it isn’t because of something that we’ve done or not done. %$* 541
but we have the potential by intervening, as we did in iraq with an expansive nation-building exercise, as we’ve done in afghanistan, as we’re still doing, try and build a central government where none has existed, of undermining our credibility of wasting our resources. %$* 541
we have to remember that military power is not the end-all and be-all of power. %$* 541
power is a lot of things. %$* 541
influence doesn’t always come at the point of a gun. %$* 541
it may relate to your prestige. %$* 541
in 2000, america’s prestige was sky-high, again, after bosnia, kosovo, and east timor. %$* 541
we had a lot of influence in the world. %$* 541
we exercised a lot of military power in this last decade. %$* 541
and by the end of the previous administration, our power and our influence in the world, our ability to make things happen, was rock-bottom. %$* 541
we’re climbing back, but it’s awfully slow. %$* 541
thank you, peter galbraith. %$* 13
our motion is "it's time to clip america's global wings." and here to summarize his position against the motion, elliot abrams, a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations, who served as deputy national security adviser in the george w. bush administration. %$* 13
my argument, in closing, has been summarized by someone else. %$* 544
i just want to read five sentences. %$* 544
“there will be times when our safety is not directly threatened, but our interests and values are. %$* 544
sometimes the course of history poses challenges that threaten our common humanity and our common security: responding to natural disasters, preventing genocide, keeping the peace, ensuring regional security, maintaining the flow of commerce. %$* 544
these may not be america’s problems alone, but they are important to us. %$* 544
they are problems worth solving. %$* 544
and in these circumstances we know that the united states as the world’s most powerful nation will often be called upon to help. %$* 544
but let us also remember that for generations we have done the hard work of protecting our own people as well as millions around the globe.” that’s president obama, and he’s right. %$* 544
if we are to be safe, if we are to be free, we really can’t escape the world as it is. %$* 544
we cannot escape the need to have and sometimes to use military power. %$* 544
on the wings that you’re being asked to clip ride the hopes of hundreds of millions of americans and many more people all over the globe, hopes for freedom and security, hopes for a better future - - for the sake of those people, for the sake of their freedom as well as ours, reject this proposition. %$* 544
don’t clip the eagle’s wings. %$* 544
thank you, elliot abrams. %$* 13
and our motion is: "it's time to clip america's global wings." and here to summarize his position for the motion, our final speaker, lawrence korb, senior fellow at the center for american-- %$* 13
since you’ve mentioned it-- %$* 543
lawrence, let me-- %$* 13
i just wanted to do an introduction, sorry. %$* 13
oh, oh, okay. %$* 543
lawrence-- %$* 13
no, no-- %$* 13
we’ll reset. %$* 13
sorry. %$* 13
lawrence korb, a senior fellow at the center for american progress, who served as assistant secretary of defense during the reagan administration. %$* 13
let me go back-- %$* 543
i was, in the beginning, questioned on my republican credentials by quoting a couple of republican presidents, though, i think summarize the point that peter and i have been trying to make. %$* 543
“maybe i’m missing something here, but we should encourage people who live in those lands”-- %$* 543
he asked about nation building-- %$* 543
“to build their own nations,” george bush, 2000, when he was running for president. %$* 543
you remember the humble foreign policy. %$* 543
that’s the point we’re trying to make. %$* 543
let me quote from another republican. %$* 543
“every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signified in the final sense a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.” if you take a look at what the republican party today, if you look at paul ryan and what he’s proposing, he wants to increase defense spending and then cut the things that are not going to help us improve our standing in science, are not going to help us be more competitive in the world. %$* 543
and what we’re opposed to, by clipping the wings, is to get over these reckless military adventures that we’ve undertaken in the first part of this century, something we hadn’t really done since vietnam. %$* 543
and let me conclude with this. %$* 543
you’ve heard all the apocalyptic scenarios. %$* 543
i remember when people said, if you got out of vietnam, all southeast asia and communism and all that kind of stuff. %$* 543
elliott meant you were going back to cam ranh bay. %$* 543
i spent a little bit of time there, you know, about 40 years ago. %$* 543
why are we going back? %$* 543
this is the people that we basically recognized we could not make them what we would like them to be. %$* 543
but they're doing okay now. %$* 543
and i think that's the point we want to make. %$* 543
we can't do it all. %$* 543
we're going to have to clip our wings when something happens. %$* 543
but look inside all your clothes and things like that. %$* 543
go down to nike and find out where your running shoes are made. %$* 543
that turned out pretty well, even though we clipped our wings back in the '70s. %$* 543
oh, oh, okay. %$* 543
since you’ve mentioned it-- %$* 543
lawrence korb, thank you very much. %$* 13
and that concludes closing statements. %$* 13
and now it's time to learn which side you, our live audience, believes has argued best. %$* 13
i'm going to ask you to go again to your key pads. %$* 13
our motion is, “it's time to clip america's global wings.” if you agree with this motion, after hearing the arguments, push number one. %$* 13
if you disagree, push number two. %$* 13
if you became or remain undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and we'll have the-- %$* 13
we'll have the results in about a minute and a half. %$* 13
but first i want to take care of a couple of things, one of which, most obviously, is to thank this panel for bringing a very, very intelligent debate to intelligence squared. %$* 13
i also want to thank everybody who had the guts to stand up and take a microphone in the audience even if the question didn't pass my filter. %$* 13
i appreciated that you did it. %$* 13
and i did hear some very good idea for future debates, though they're not related to tonight's. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
we also want to point out, intelligence squared is run as a very, very lean operation. %$* 13
and we are going to be losing one of our key players who's moving on to other things by her own choice. %$* 13
lindsay nelson has been with the organization nearly since the beginning. %$* 13
she is responsible, in fact, for having designed this set, for making the television broadcast possible, for bringing us to this theater. %$* 13
she has designed the programs that are in your hands. %$* 13
she is possibly the youngest member of our staff, so she keeps everyone but me hip. %$* 13
and we're going to miss her tremendously because her impact on this has been profound, and we just want to-- %$* 13
i'm not sure if she's even in the room here. %$* 13
but if she is, she's probably hiding under a chair at this point. %$* 13
we want to thank her with a real round of applause for everything she's done. %$* 13
so our theme this spring has been “america's house divided.” and our last debate of the season is on tuesday the 3rd of may. %$* 13
the motion will be, don't give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses. %$* 13
we have arguing for this motion, kris kobach. %$* 13
kris kobach has been the driving force behind most of the controversial immigration laws sweeping the country, including arizona's senate bill 1070. %$* 13
he is now leading a movement to eliminate birth right citizenship through state legislation. %$* 13
joining him will be former colorado congressman tom tancredo, who has called amnesty a terrible policy and terrible politics. %$* 13
and he once advocated for a civics literacy test as a prerequisite for voting. %$* 13
against the motion is julian castro. %$* 13
he is the youngest mayor ever to be elected to the country's seventh largest city, san antonio, texas. %$* 13
after his win, the economist declared "castro has the charm, the brains and the boldness to one day become a hispanic barack obama." his partner will be tamar jacoby, who over the years has gone from being an editor at newsweek and the new york times to becoming one of the pro-immigration movement's most conservative voices. %$* 13
she is now the president and ceo of immigration works usa. tickets to our future-- %$* 13
or our next debate are available to the website and at the skirball box office. %$* 13
and don't forget to follow intelligence squared u.s.on twitter and make sure to become a fan on facebook. %$* 13
and if you do, you'll receive a discount on future debates. %$* 13
and as i said earlier, all of our debates can be heard on npr stations across the country. %$* 13
and you can watch them on bloomberg television, this debate on bloomberg television starting next monday. %$* 13
if you visit bloomberg.com, you'll find out where to go for your local channel. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
it's all in. %$* 13
i have the results now. %$* 13
here is how you voted before the debate. %$* 13
on the motion, “it's time to clip america's global wings,” before the debate, 37 percent were for the motion, 26 percent against, 37 percent undecided. %$* 13
after the debate, 47 percent are for the motion. %$* 13
that's up 10 percent. %$* 13
44 percent are against. %$* 13
that is up 18 percent. %$* 13
and nine percent are undecided. %$* 13
that means the team arguing against the motion, “it's time to clip america's global wings” has won this debate. %$* 13
our congratulations to them. %$* 13
thank you from me, john donvan and intelligence squared u.s. %$* 13

they basically have been debating a proposition that is not before us tonight, which is - we should continue welcoming legal immigration. %$* 93
all of our team member is for that. %$* 93
we agree that legal immigration is part of this country’s history. %$* 93
uh, it is appropriate. %$* 93
it is, uh %$* 93
it brings values. %$* 93
but, but one of the values that this country stands for, is the rule of law. %$* 93
uh, if we continue to wink at illegal immigration, i think that we are cutting away at the fabric of what makes this country great. %$* 93
there is nothing “inhumane” about enforcing laws in a color-blind, fair manner. %$* 93
we have yet to do that. %$* 93
uh, but it is not inherently %$* 93
one. %$* 135
“inhumane” to have an immigration law. %$* 93
we haven’t tried it. %$* 93
uh, when we start, we will be sending a message to people that it is not right to come here. %$* 93
we are working with mexico. %$* 93
uh, we are giving them aid. %$* 93
we are working on the border. %$* 93
they have a responsibility. %$* 93
other countries have a responsibility, it seems to me, to, to, to do something about their own economies, uh, which we are trying to help them with, and to prevent their citizens from trying to come into this country illegally. %$* 93
uh, again, we are a great country, and part of that is the rule of law. %$* 93
and that currently, the system is broken. %$* 93
the thing to do is to start fixing it, by enforcing it. %$* 93
thank you. %$* 93
well, we have heard, i think, a lot of, uh, sleight of hand by the opposing team, which is to conflate illegal immigration and legal immigration. %$* 93
they basically have been debating a proposition that is not before us tonight, which is - we should continue welcoming legal immigration. %$* 93
all of our team member is for that. %$* 93
we agree that legal immigration is part of this country’s history. %$* 93
uh, it is appropriate. %$* 93
it is, uh %$* 93
it brings values. %$* 93
but, but one of the values that this country stands for, is the rule of law. %$* 93
uh, if we continue to wink at illegal immigration, i think that we are cutting away at the fabric of what makes this country great. %$* 93
there is nothing “inhumane” about enforcing laws in a color-blind, fair manner. %$* 93
we have yet to do that. %$* 93
uh, but it is not inherently %$* 93
speaking for the resolution, heather mac donald. %$* 135
now to speak against the resolution, in final rebuttal, karen narasaki. %$* 135
all we are trying to debate tonight is, what kind of country do we want to be? %$* 342
how do we want to enforce these laws? %$* 342
restrictionists, for example, object to allowing undocumented immigrants to have bank accounts and pay taxes. %$* 342
they say “that’s welcoming. %$* 342
” yet, without bank accounts, these immigrants are vulnerable to criminals who know to rob their businesses or invade their homes because they know they will find a lot of cash. %$* 342
and how does it help americans to stop immigrants from being able to pay taxes to help cover their share of the cost of building roads or running schools? %$* 342
isn’t that one of the reasons restrictions give for what they feel is unfair about undocumented immigrants in the first place? %$* 342
which, by the way, do pay taxes. %$* 342
and in fact, in a recent study that was done on long island, for example, immigrants were paying much more of their share of taxes than they were actually using as benefits. %$* 342
so let’s jettison the old way of thinking, because it really hasn’t served our country well. %$* 342
let’s ask ourselves %$* 342
one. %$* 135
do we want to be a country where we turn teachers and co-workers, ministers and nurses and neighbors into immigration police? %$* 342
or one where we have sense %$* 342
sensible, realistic immigration flows, with a well-trained border enforcement agency, who are held accountable for following their own laws? %$* 342
one that continues to hold agencies accountable for following the rules when they make decisions about people’s lives, or one that illuminates the systems of checks and balances and sacrifices due process along the way? %$* 342
if you vote for our side, it’s because you believe that it’s time for us to stop scapegoating immigrants, and instead focus on how do we fix the real problems? %$* 342
how do we fix the push that pushes immigrants here? %$* 342
and what do we do with immigrants once they are here, to make sure that our communities are healthy and thriving, and that we continue to be able to compete well in the global marketplace. %$* 342
thank you. %$* 342
all we are trying to debate tonight is, what kind of country do we want to be? %$* 342

karen narasaki speaking against the resolution. %$* 135
now to speak for the resolution, in final rebuttal, vernon briggs. %$* 135
uh, the current situation we have, of massive user immigration system, breeds widespread cynicism throughout the country by illegals and by citizens about what are american values? %$* 339
illegal immigrants know they are exploited, but they have no choice but to take the jobs that are offered to them; they are still better what they had where they came from. %$* 339
citizens are appalled with the lack of concern by their own government %$* 339
country, uh, on the %$* 339
about the unfairness of the competition that low wage workers are confronting with the presence of illegal immigrations. %$* 339
perversely, we has set up a system, where those lawyers - uh, sorry - where those employers who try to follow the immigration, uh, laws of the united states are, are %$* 339
or who, uh, or law %$* 339
are put at a competitive disadvantage by firms that are allowed to violate the laws and can under, uh, uh %$* 339
underbid them and under %$* 339
and undersell them in the labor market. %$* 339
currently, by the way, because we don’t enforce our immigration laws, we are, we are basically, well, rewarding law breaking %$* 339
and, uh, and those who follow the law, they are actually punished. %$* 339
many years ago, the famous cbs correspondent edward r. murrow said, “the duty of journalists is to separate slogans from policies.” %$* 339
one. %$* 135
i think that’s the duty of scholars also. %$* 339
tonight, we have heard a lot of slogans from the other side, but no policies. %$* 339
our position is one of clear policy - not slogans about “scapegoating” and “nation of immigrations” and “who we are as americans” and all that. %$* 339
we are talking basically here about policy. %$* 339
that if we could %$* 339
if we could actually begin to enforce our immigration policies, we could then turn to the real issues of what’s pushing people out of these countries, that i would love to discuss. %$* 339
and those are the big issues. %$* 339
but we can’t get to those issues - human rights violations, uh, population pressures, unfair trade policies and all the rest of them - because the system is so out of kilter, because we don’t enforce our immigration laws. %$* 339
we desperately need to do so. %$* 339
the jordan commission said, the credibility of the immigration policy can be measured by a simple yardstick. %$* 339
do people who get in, uh - who should get in, do get in? %$* 339
the people who should not get in are kept out. %$* 339
and the people who are deportable - are required to leave. %$* 339
that’s barbara jordan. %$* 339
no racist. %$* 339
and it can’t be said any clearer. %$* 339
uh, the current situation we have, of massive user immigration system, breeds widespread cynicism throughout the country by illegals and by citizens about what are american values? %$* 339
illegal immigrants know they are exploited, but they have no choice but to take the jobs that are offered to them; they are still better what they had where they came from. %$* 339

many years ago, the famous cbs correspondent edward r. murrow said, “the duty of journalists is to separate slogans from policies.” %$* 339
thank you, vernon briggs. %$* 135
before our last two speakers, let me remind you of the motion. %$* 135
let’s stop welcoming undocumented immigrants. %$* 135
our final speaker, against the motion, enrique morones. %$* 135
well, thank you all very much. %$* 340
and i want to pass on my, my love and my, uh, support to, uh, the fact that, that we are all here today. %$* 340
and, and i appreciate the fact that we would going to be able to debate this. %$* 340
remember that, um %$* 340
what right do we have to deny anybody to have a better life? %$* 340
what right do we have? %$* 340
we want a %$* 340
we have a solution that six %$* 340
like, three and a half million people demonstrated when they marched in the streets last spring. %$* 340
like, 65 percent of the country, according to a gallup poll, supports it. %$* 340
it’s comprehensive and humane immigration reform. %$* 340
i, i, i keep on repeating this. %$* 340
many of you, in your history, are familiar with the politics of hate. %$* 340
shouldn’t somebody have stepped in and said, “we have got to stop this? %$* 340
” love is in action, and not in words. %$* 340
it’s important that we go and, and demonstrate the best of america. %$* 340
the best of america - the diversity. %$* 340
the whole world used to hold us up and look at us and say, “that’s what we strive to be.” that’s not taking place right now. %$* 340
we want to get back to that. %$* 340
and we can. %$* 340
sleight of hand. %$* 340
well, the sources that i have are business week, the wall street journal, the good book. %$* 340
and i am talking about serious %$* 340
one. %$* 135
serious, uh, documentation, and not using this type of rhetoric, this type of dehumanizing language, which only promotes the politics of fear. %$* 340
we want to have the rule of law. %$* 340
i believe in a, in a law from, uh, above - but i also believe in the laws of a country. %$* 340
but remember, sometimes laws are wrong. %$* 340
and we had slaves in this country, and that was a law. %$* 340
women could not vote, that was a law. %$* 340
child labor, that was a law. %$* 340
somebody had to stand up and say, “this is wrong.” and that’s why it’s important that you vote against this motion. %$* 340
it’s wrong what is taking place. %$* 340
and we have a lot of work to do. %$* 340
there is not easy solutions. %$* 340
but you have got to look at yourself in the mirror and say, “hey, i did the right thing.” when your grandkids ask you, “what did you do when all those people were dying, when the families were being raided, what did you do? %$* 340
did you do the right thing? %$* 340
” and let’s build a better america. %$* 340
and it’s the immigrants that build a better america. %$* 340
give those people a humane way in which to enter, and not die at the border - as two people per day are dying. %$* 340
two people died today. %$* 340
we cannot continue to allow this to happen. %$* 340
we have a lot of work to do - a lot of work to do within this country. %$* 340
it’s a great and generous country. %$* 340
well, thank you all very much. %$* 340
and i want to pass on my, my love and my, uh, support to, uh, the fact that, that we are all here today. %$* 340
and, and i appreciate the fact that we would going to be able to debate this. %$* 340

enrique morones %$* 135
let’s practice what we preach. %$* 340
speaking against the motion. %$* 135
thank you very much. %$* 135
our final speaker, in rebuttal, for the motion, mark krikorian. %$* 135
and i am a bad person. %$* 341
i would love to debate what the level of legal immigration should be, how we should organize it, who we should pick, who we should not. %$* 341
in fact, i have a book coming out in the summer that, uh, addresses that very question from sentinel, available in july. %$* 341
um, but that’s %$* 341
but you are a bad person. %$* 135
that’s not the debate before us, though. %$* 341
the question really we are facing, for our purposes tonight is, are we willing to enforce the law? %$* 341
we have a heard a lot of “if’s” and “would’s” and “should’s” and “need to’s” from the other side about enforcement. %$* 341
but i think we all understand that if the bush amnesty bill that was debated in the senate this summer had passed, that, um, the commitment to enforcement would last only until the last illegal alien in line got his green card - at which point it would just, like in 1986, evaporate. %$* 341
and a few years after that %$* 341
one. %$* 135
we would have a burgeoning illegal population, because the market does not determine illegal immigration - our policies do, in large part - and we would have the same debate, saying “we need to have realistic laws that legalize all the next batch of illegal immigrants.” we need to decide - are we willing to enforce the borders of the united states and the laws determined by the american people through their elected representatives - or do we want, in effect, to abolish american sovereignty and embrace the, say, e.u. or other, uh, model that the other side has used %$* 341
where we, the american people, no longer decide what our immigration policy is. %$* 341
that’s not the debate before us, though. %$* 341
the question really we are facing, for our purposes tonight is, are we willing to enforce the law? %$* 341
we have a heard a lot of “if’s” and “would’s” and “should’s” and “need to’s” from the other side about enforcement. %$* 341

um, but that’s %$* 341
thank you, mark krikorian. %$* 135

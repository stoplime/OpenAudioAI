well— welcome everyone to another debate from intelligence squared us, i’m john donvan of abc news, and once again it is my honor and pleasure to be serving as moderator as the six debaters you see sharing the stage with me here at the skirball center for the performing arts at new york university, six debaters, three against three, will be debating this motion, “america is to blame for mexico’s drug war.” now, normally at this point in the evening the chairman of intelligence squared, robert rosenkranz, who is also chairman of the rosenkranz foundation, takes to the stage, and he briefly outlines what’s before us, what our debate really is about and what the issues are. %$* 13
unfortunately he has taken ill this evening so we will not be hearing from him and we wish him well. %$* 13
i’ll just say very briefly, in terms of the drug war—that language has been around a long time, it’s 40 years this year that richard nixon first declared a war on drugs in the united states. %$* 13
mexico launched its war on drugs three years ago, the difference is, that in mexico it really is a war, as we think of war. %$* 13
it involves troops, and grenades and bombs and bullets, and it has come at a huge cost of 10,000 lives lost. %$* 13
the question before us is whether the united states has some responsibility to bear for this, given the fact that the united states serves as such a large market for narcotics, the question is also raised, whether there would be a war at all, whether the cartels could arm themselves but for the supply of illicit weapons from the united states. %$* 13
are we in essence, responsibility for those 10,000 deaths. %$* 13
that is the question before us but we’re putting it in this form, “america is to blame for mexico’s drug war.” i want to remind everyone this is not a panel discussion or a seminar, this is a debate, it’s a contest, there will be winners and losers. %$* 13
and you in our audience will be the judges, you will pick the winners, you will have voted twice by the time the debate begins, once before, and once again after the debate. %$* 13
and the team that moves the most voters, that changes the most minds, will be declared our winner. %$* 13
now let’s go to the preliminary vote, before the debate begins. %$* 13
and turn to the keypad at your left side %$* 13
there’s a range of numbers, but you only need to concern yourselves with numbers 1, 2, or 3. if you agree with the motion, “america is to blame for mexico’s drug war,” push number 1, if you disagree, push number 2, and if you are undecided %$* 13
push number 3.if you make a mistake, just correct it, and the system will lock in your last response. %$* 13
all right, i will have those results fairly shortly, but we’re going to move on now, so— on to our debate and on to round 1, opening statements from each of the debaters, seven minutes each, uninterrupted. %$* 13
and, speaking first, for the motion, fareed zakaria, who— and if there are people out there still who doubt that an intellectual can also be popular in the united states, fareed zakaria is that example, he is the host— fareed, you can make your way to the microphone—he is the host of “fareed zakaria, gps” on cnn and fareed, i’m certain that has nothing to do with getting directions off the highway. %$* 13
what does the “gps” stand for? %$* 13
“global public square.” %$* 447
“global public square,” how appropriate for this, ladies and gentlemen, fareed zakaria. %$* 13
thank you very much, it’s such a pleasure to be here. %$* 447
you know, i feel very comfortable, i have to say, at the outset with the opposing team, sharing a podium with people with very different views about drugs, immigration, mexico, because, my show at cnn is actually taped in the same studios as lou dobbs’s. %$* 447
so i shared— i shared studio space with lou dobbs, i can share a platform with you gentlemen, i’m delighted to do so. %$* 447
look, what i thought i would do is try to convince you as best i can, that you should vote for this proposition. %$* 447
and, we are on the 40th anniversary of the drug war. %$* 447
the war on drugs was declared by richard nixon, and it began a vast effort by the united states government, to transform the issue of drugs into one about criminality and war. %$* 447
and it began a massive program in the united states that has spread throughout the region. %$* 447
the results are in, 40 years out, i would argue. %$* 447
we have spent about $1 trillion. %$* 447
that does not count by the way what local and state governments spend every year, to enforce the war on drugs, which is $41 billion. %$* 447
every year. %$* 447
now, if you look at any metric, i would argue, that would be reasonable to apply the availability of drug use, the potency of drugs, for the most part the price—the metrics suggest the drug war has failed, it has done nothing to dampen demand, it has perhaps in many ways increased potency, and certainly increased criminality. %$* 447
so, if you look at the simplest statistic in terms of what the effect of this vast war on drugs has had over the last 40 years. %$* 447
in the 1970s, the united states had the same incarceration rate, as every other country in the world. %$* 447
we were about at the world average in terms of how many people we imprisoned, as a percentage of our population. %$* 447
that rate today, is five times the world average. %$* 447
in 1980, those blissful, halcyon days of 1980, we had 41,000 people in prison on drug-related charges. %$* 447
today we have 500,000 people. %$* 447
so, if you ask yourself, what the effect in the united states has been it seems to me plain, it is blindingly obvious. %$* 447
the question, i suppose, we have to then ask ourselves is what is the effect outside the united states, because there has been another effect of this war on drugs, which has been to internationalize the problem. %$* 447
because we began this process, by interdicting in miami, and then started moving to the sources, because the sources also started fleeing offshore. %$* 447
then we went into central america. %$* 447
you all remember that before we had the heroic wars of liberation in afghanistan and iraq we had the heroic war of liberation in panama, where manuel noriega was indicted in a us court for drug dealing and we decided to send the us army there, play very loud rock music, i am not kidding, and effectively arrested him. %$* 447
what has happened in almost all those cases is, the supply then shifts. %$* 447
and so it then shifted to colombia, and we began plan colombia, which has been a vast, multi-year effort with many, many hundreds of american soldiers. %$* 447
when we talk about mexico’s drug war which i will get to, one has to remember, that the wars on drugs that the united states has initiated over the last 40 years, have very much been ones involving troops and soldiers and bullets and deaths. %$* 447
mexico is only the last in a long line of these drug wars. %$* 447
and so we got to colombia, where the united states has now spent something in the range of eight to $10 billion. %$* 447
colombia for many years was the second or third largest recipient of us aid, and much of that aid has gone toward intensely military activities. %$* 447
the gao, the government accounting office was asked to provide a summary report on what the effect of plan colombia has been. %$* 447
and this was only a few months ago, asked for by vice president biden, then- senator biden, had commissioned the report. %$* 447
and the results are plain. %$* 447
it has had virtually no effect. %$* 447
it seems as though heroin production is down, but cocaine production is up. %$* 447
and so you see the familiar whack-a-mole problem of the drug trade, which is that you push something down and something else pops up. %$* 447
and the two most common substitutions you see are the kind of drug, so you go from heroin to cocaine, and the place that these come from. %$* 447
you push it out of the caribbean, you—it goes into panama, you push it out of panama it goes into colombia, you push it out of colombia, it goes to mexico. %$* 447
and thus mexico has to be seen as the last of a long line of these battles, in america’s war on drugs. %$* 447
and so in that sense you have to ask yourself, are we not in some way responsible for it? %$* 447
well here’s the simple reality. %$* 447
we are the largest consumer of drugs in the world. %$* 447
we have the most demand in the world. %$* 447
and we also have the largest supply of weaponry in the world. %$* 447
2,000 guns cross the american border every day to go into mexico. %$* 447
hillary clinton has pointed out that we are arming the mexican gangsters who operate the drug trade. %$* 447
president obama has pointed out that 90 percent of the weapons that are found in mexico can be traced back to the united states. %$* 447
there has been some contestation over the statistics %$* 447
fox news says it’s only 17 percent, factcheck.org says it’s probably higher than 36 percent, but maybe not quite as high as 90 percent. %$* 447
let me give you a simple statistic. %$* 447
the united states has 280 million guns. %$* 447
50 percent of all gun production every year is bought in the united states. %$* 447
there are 80 million registered gun users in the united states. %$* 447
there are 2,500 in mexico. %$* 447
i think we may have something to do with this problem. %$* 447
so if you accept my proposition that the supply of weapons is coming from one place and the demand for drugs is coming from one place, it seems self-evident that we are responsible. %$* 447
you will hear many convincing arguments by honorable people on that side. %$* 447
honorable opponents of the mexican government like mr. %$* 447
castañeda who ran against president calderón. %$* 447
asa hutchinson who ran the drug enforcement agency. %$* 447
but remember one thing. %$* 447
the only question we are asking you is are we in some way responsible. %$* 447
let us not one more time shirk our responsibility, and accept that the united states, as the leading consumer of drugs, and the leading supplier of weapons, has got to be partly or substantially to blame for this. %$* 447
mexico is the latest battle— %$* 447
—in america’s drug war— %$* 447
thank you. %$* 447
fareed zakaria— %$* 13
—in america’s drug war— %$* 447
—your time is up, thank you. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 447
our motion is “america is to blame for mexico’s drug war,” and speaking first against the motion, asa hutchinson who was a congressman from arkansas, an elected position, but he’s also held significant appointed positions, he was a us attorney, he was in the department of homeland security for controlling border security, and was also director of the drug enforcement agency which, asa, makes it sound like, in terms of this narcotics issue, for a long time, you were the law. %$* 13
indeed, and we enforced the law. %$* 448
ladies and gentlemen, asa hutchinson. %$* 13
thank you, and seriously, i did have occasion to head up the drug enforcement administration, the dea, and there’s one thing i learned, fareed, very quickly as head of the dea, that when you made a speech somewhere you had a way of drawing protesters. %$* 448
and particularly if you debated drug policy in san francisco, so i am delighted that this audience is a little bit more friendly. %$* 448
and the other thing i learned that as a dad of a teenaged daughter, that being head of the dea was a good way to drive away boyfriends that you didn’t want calling on your daughter. %$* 448
so, there are a few advantages to that. %$* 448
i am here today, on this debate topic because i believe it is critically important to the national security of the united states. %$* 448
i believe what happens in mexico is critically important to that country, but i also believe that what happens in the overall fight against illegal drugs is important for this generation and the next of americans. %$* 448
and i would agree with fareed that we do have responsibilities, as united states citizens to reduce the demand for drugs in our country. %$* 448
there is a responsibility but ladies and gentlemen, i’ve noticed something thus far today, and they’re trying to change the proposition. %$* 448
the proposition is not that the united states shares some responsibility. %$* 448
the proposition is that america is to blame. %$* 448
and i believe there’s a distinction between blame and responsibility, or joint responsibility, or some responsibility. %$* 448
and “blame” is a heavy word, that implies that we as a government of the united states are doing something wrong. %$* 448
i agree that we have responsibility but it’s a shared responsibility. %$* 448
drug consumption is not unique to the united states. %$* 448
i met with vincente fox in mexico city. %$* 448
and i was there as under-secretary at homeland security but he didn’t want to talk about that subject with secretary ridge, he turned to me and said asa, you were head of the dea, we’ve got a problem in mexico with drug consumption and addiction that we need to do something about. %$* 448
he was talking about mexicans, and he’s talking about the challenges of drugs in his society. %$* 448
and that is across the globe that there is that problem. %$* 448
and %$* 448
to respond to fareed about where we are in our fight against drugs today, we should be reminded of some of our successes. %$* 448
ladies and gentlemen, since the late ‘70s and early ‘80s, when we initiated strong effort against the fight against drugs, we have reduced overall drug consumption in the united states by 50 percent. %$* 448
please remember that statistic, you can go on monitoring the future websites, a consistent poll and survey that’s done, as well as samhsa’s survey %$* 448
overall drug use has declined 50 percent in our country, cocaine use has declined 75 percent, since the height of the drug problems in the ‘70s, and in the ‘80s. %$* 448
ladies and gentlemen, that is progress that represents saved lives. %$* 448
now let me move quickly to why the mexican drug war, the united states is not to blame for mexico’s drug war. %$* 448
and the first answer is that mexico has allowed itself to be a major transit and source country. %$* 448
they are a transit country obviously for drugs but the source drugs that come from mexico, heroin, marijuana that they grow in the hills, as well as methamphetamine that they produce, they’re sources of that, and they as a sovereign country have allowed themselves to be in that predicament. %$* 448
secondly, mexico has resisted us help. %$* 448
this is important to put this in the context of history. %$* 448
in the 1980s, as fareed pointed out, two thirds of our illegal drugs in the united states came through the caribbean basin into miami. %$* 448
we had miami vice, we slowed it down in the caribbean basin, but they moved toward other avenues to bring it in, and that being mexico and today 90 percent of the cocaine comes through mexico. %$* 448
how did this happen. %$* 448
it’s because mexico did not shoulder the burden to say we want to resist in our country, it is a long historic problem that goes back to the ‘80s, decades, it’s not something that’s just happened in the last three years. %$* 448
a key event happened. %$* 448
in february of 1985, kiki camarena, a wonderful dea agent, was captured in guadalajara, brutally beaten, tortured, and murdered. %$* 448
it was a seminal event in our relations. %$* 448
as a result of that there was a massive manhunt for the perpetrators of that. %$* 448
mexico believed that we were infringing upon their sovereignty. %$* 448
and therefore, they resisted any us assistance after that event in 1985, in fact in 1986 the foreign minister of mexico said, that “the activities of the dea trample our sovereignty.” and ladies and gentlemen, i am here today respecting fully the government of mexico for their sovereignty, but they have made their own decisions, as we have made our decisions and they are a responsible nation and they would not want to blame the united states of america, they are the ones that resisted our assistance during that time. %$* 448
president calderón has most recently reinvigorated this fight against the drug-trafficking organizations in mexico. %$* 448
but whose decision was it to move from, you’re infringing upon our sovereignty, in the ‘80s, and dea get out, we don’t want to have anything to do with you, to the partnership that president calderón wants to have. %$* 448
it was a sovereign decision by the leader of mexico that said we’re going to go to war against the drug cartels. %$* 448
that decision should not be blamed on the united states of america, it was a mexican decision. %$* 448
and then fourthly, it is very important to understand, that the culture of corruption that has developed in mexico, the failure of the rule of law in mexico, is one of the largest contributing factors to the violence that we see today. %$* 448
and, i was on the crime subcommittee. %$* 448
i asked a question of a cartel member who was brought there to testify. %$* 448
i said what is the greatest weapon that you fear in the united states arsenal, or in the law enforcement arsenal. %$* 448
the answer came back very quickly, we fear extradition. %$* 448
and why is that. %$* 448
they did not fear law enforcement in mexico or in central america. %$* 448
it was extradition to the united states of america, you cannot have a failure of the rule of law, and be successful in the fight against drugs. %$* 448
the cartels have operated with impunity, and that is not the fault of the united states. %$* 448
the united states is not at fault for the historic problems in mexico, we are not to blame for what has happened. %$* 448
thank you, asa hutchinson. %$* 13
speaking now for our motion, “america is to blame for mexico’s drug war,” jeffrey miron who is a harvard economist and whose views on narcotics in this country i think among this panel are probably unique. %$* 13
on most drugs he believes in decriminalization, and with decriminalization, no war. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, jeffrey miron. %$* 13
thank you very much, it’s very nice to be here, see so many people interested in this topic. %$* 449
let me start by responding very briefly to a few of things that mr. %$* 449
hutchinson said. %$* 449
he said that in fact there’s evidence that the war on drugs has been effective in reducing drug use, as he mentioned that’s not really on point, that’s not really the question. %$* 449
but it’s also not correct. %$* 449
there’s tons of evidence, and i’m responsible for some of that evidence in my academic writing, on whether attempts to reduce consumption of drugs with prohibition are effective, and it universally finds little if any effect. %$* 449
yes, you can cherry-pick certain statistics to find that in some periods drug use went down, okay, but in other periods it’s gone up, or some other kind of drug use went up, the overall result is clearly no evidence for the efficacy of prohibition. %$* 449
and note that over the last 40 years, we have dramatically ramped up our efforts to enforce prohibition, so we should have seen some effects if those effects were in any way going to be effective. %$* 449
now turning to the proposition itself. %$* 449
is america to blame for mexico’s drug wars. %$* 449
the answer is indisputably yes. %$* 449
i want to argue it in three steps. %$* 449
first, there’s a fact already mentioned, that the us consumes a lot of drugs produced or trans-shipped through mexico. %$* 449
no one disputes that and that’s clearly a part of the issue, but it’s not the whole issue, and it’s not the most important part of the issue, why, well %$* 449
one, there’s not really anything we can do about the fact that the us consumers choose to consume drugs. %$* 449
other countries consume some of the drugs from mexico including mexicans, including canada or europe, et cetera. %$* 449
but it is a piece of the story and it is one sense in which you might say that the proposition that america is to blame, is correct. %$* 449
but there’s a much, much more important sense. %$* 449
why are there drug wars in mexico. %$* 449
why is there violence in the drug trade in the us, and many other countries. %$* 449
the reason there are drug wars is because the drug trade is prohibited. %$* 449
whether you think drugs should be legal or not, it’s an indisputable fact, based on theory and evidence, that when you drive a market underground, it becomes violent. %$* 449
why does it become violent? %$* 449
because participants in an underground market cannot resolve their disputes with courts, with lawyers, by complaining to the consumer product safety commission or things like that. %$* 449
they can only resolve their disputes by shooting each other or by threatening to shoot each other. %$* 449
we see evidence of this from all over history and all over the world. %$* 449
the us alcohol industry was not violent before 1920, when we passed alcohol prohibition. %$* 449
it was then dramatically violent for 14 years, until we repealed alcohol prohibition, and then the trade became perfectly nonviolent just like any other legal good. %$* 449
if we look at the history of prohibition of drugs, that trade was not violent until we prohibited drugs, and ramped up and escalated the war on drugs. %$* 449
if you look at other commodities from gambling to prostitution to blue jeans supplied in controlled economies where they were in short supply, to commodities driven underground by high tax rates, whenever you drive a market underground, that market becomes violent because participants resolve their disputes with violence, okay, completely independent of the characteristics of the good, whether you’re in favor or not of prohibiting that good, it’s just a fact of nature that the prohibition creates the violence. %$* 449
now the second thing to recognize is that the us, far and away above any other country, has historically and repeatedly and persistently been the country that has foisted prohibition on the entire world. %$* 449
starting in 1919, in paris, at the signing of the treaty of versailles which ended world war i, the us said it would not sign unless there was a clause in the treaty that required every other country to immediately go back and adopt drug prohibition. %$* 449
this is in 1919.throughout the history of the united nations the us has made fighting drugs and prohibiting drugs in particular a key part of the un’s mission. %$* 449
and very recently, the us has actively tried to push canada, england, other countries, and in particular mexico, to enforce drug prohibition and to adopt drug laws that we approve of. %$* 449
let me read you some quotes that suggest someone else thinks this is right as well. %$* 449
“while every mexican administration since the ‘60s has piously declared that it intended to intensify its drug enforcement efforts for domestic motivations, the fact is that the real reason has always been american pressure.” okay? %$* 449
quote one. %$* 449
quote two. %$* 449
“all this starts to show why current us drug policy would have to change in order for mexico to change its stance. %$* 449
it also explains why it is virtually impossible for mexico to follow a different policy unilaterally.” okay? %$* 449
so who wrote those words, suggesting that the us policy, the us insistence, the us pressure on mexico, is the crucial factor, in determining mexico’s drug policy. %$* 449
well, it turns out it’s one of my opponents, jorge castañeda, in an article that i found on the web a few days ago. %$* 449
so i don’t think that point, that the us has tried very, very hard, not always successfully, but has tried consistently, to make sure every country adopts drug prohibition-- %$* 449
that point is just not beyond rational dispute. %$* 449
so, part of the discussion here clearly is about what people think about legalization. %$* 449
i’ll comment on that in a second. %$* 449
but you actually don’t need to take a stand on whether it’s good to have drug legalization or drug prohibition, to take a view on the motion. %$* 449
you should be in favor of the motion because it’s just a matter of science and the evidence, that the us pressure to enforce prohibition in mexico and the us prohibition in the us, are the reasons for the drug violence. %$* 449
now some people may argue that violence is a cost of doing something that’s worthwhile. %$* 449
they may argue that prohibition reduces drug use, they may argue that drug prohibition has some other moral statement or something like that. %$* 449
many other people including me would argue that prohibition mainly does bad things, not only the violence but the corruption, the restrictions on medicinal uses of drugs for people who are suffering, the infringements on civil liberties and on and on. %$* 449
okay, and so you would think that for lots of reasons legalization is the right policy. %$* 449
but you don’t have to take a stand on that, regardless of your views on that, the correct position about the motion is that the us is indeed the single factor to blame for mexico’s drug wars. %$* 449
thank you very much. %$* 449
thank you, jeffrey miron. %$* 13
a reminder of where we are, we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared us debate, i’m john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
we have six debaters, two teams of three, and they’re debating this motion, “america is to blame for mexico’s drug war.” you have heard three opening statements, and now on to the fourth, i’d like to introduce chris cox, the argument has already been made, that one of the reasons for mexico’s drug war is the availability of an illicit supply of weapons from the united states. %$* 13
chris cox is going to debate that point, as chief lobbyist for the national rifle association. %$* 13
chris cox. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 450
look, we can all agree that mexico’s violent drug war is destroying innocent lives on both sides of the border. %$* 450
but some have suggested tonight that lax us gun laws or the lack of enough anti-gun laws are somehow to blame for this crisis. %$* 450
yes! %$* 9
i’m here to tell you—i’m here to tell you that it’s not just wrong, and it’s not just dishonest, it’s also a deliberate diversion away from the issues that really matter. %$* 450
so tonight let’s dispose of the lies and start telling the truth on this issue for a change. %$* 450
one that you just heard tonight was how 90 percent of the guns that are used by the drug cartels, come from the united states. %$* 450
well, and not from cnn but after independent fact-checking organizations looked into it, it turned out the number wasn’t 90 percent. %$* 450
it wasn’t even close but fareed, the question shouldn’t be how many guns, whether it’s 1 percent or 100 percent the question should be, well how can we reduce that number. %$* 450
that should be the question before us and the question is, well, maybe we can make smuggling guns into mexico illegal, but the problem is we’ve already made it illegal. %$* 450
it’s illegal on both sides of the border, and you can’t really make something any more illegal than it already is. %$* 450
so let’s be absolutely clear. %$* 450
if you’re smuggling drugs, or running guns or doing anything illegal with a gun, whether it’s in mexico city or new york city, you oughta be arrested, prosecuted, and thrown in jail. %$* 450
i think that’s something we can all agree with. %$* 450
no one more so than the national rifle association. %$* 450
because these armed criminals don’t just endanger our families, they endanger our freedoms. %$* 450
and that’s why the nra’s worked to pass meaningful laws, so if you misuse a gun in the commission of a crime, you’re going to go to jail. %$* 450
let me mention just a few that we’ve worked on. %$* 450
if you give or even lend a gun to someone that you even think isn’t allowed to have one, you can go to jail for 10 years. %$* 450
if you’re arrested for dealing drugs and carrying a gun in this country, your sentence starts at five years, and that’s just for the gun. %$* 450
pull the trigger, 10 years. %$* 450
if you shoot someone, you can go to jail for life or get the death penalty. %$* 450
and that’s not three strikes and you’re out, that’s one strike and you’re out. %$* 450
i challenge anyone to look at me with a straight face and say we could end the drug war in mexico if we just pass one more gun law in the united states. %$* 450
it’s absurd, it won’t work, so let’s stop pretending that it will. %$* 450
ask yourself. %$* 450
if american criminals don’t obey american gun laws, and mexican criminals don’t obey mexican gun laws, how is it that some new gun control law here in the united states is suddenly going to be obeyed by both. %$* 450
it’s not. %$* 450
look, if you get caught trying to smuggle a gun into mexico, you’re going to a us jail for a long time. %$* 450
and if you get caught on the mexican side of the border, you could go to a mexican jail for even longer. %$* 450
that is unless you can afford to make a donation to the arresting officer scholarship fund, which to these drug cartels, is nothing more than a small tax on doing business. %$* 450
so let’s not dance around the truth. %$* 450
the truth is they pump about $40 billion worth of product into our country. %$* 450
and it’s not just drugs. %$* 450
this is a sophisticated criminal enterprise, that seems to be involved in child prostitution, money- laundering, trafficking of pirated dvd’s, it’s a sophisticated enterprise. %$* 450
so it’s no wonder, they post profits of somewhere between 14 and $25 billion every year. %$* 450
that’s more profit than microsoft makes. %$* 450
with that kind of money they’re buying whoever they want, whatever they want, wherever it is, no matter what it costs. %$* 450
judging from the weapons that are seized, we know what they want. %$* 450
fully automatic machine guns, rpg’s, hand grenades, armored personnel carriers, everything from airplanes to boats. %$* 450
now intelligence sources say that this type of weaponry comes from the international black market. %$* 450
places like china and guatemala. %$* 450
but i gotta tell you the one place it doesn’t come from, are american gun shows or some mom-and-pop gun store in texas or arizona, ‘cause you can’t buy fully automatic weapons there, and you sure as hell can’t buy hand grenades, rpg’s and helicopter gunships. %$* 450
but there is another place that it’s available. %$* 450
the mexican government. %$* 450
according to the new york times, in the last seven years, more than 100,000 soldiers have deserted the mexican army. %$* 450
now how many people here think that all 100,000 turned their guns in before they betrayed their country. %$* 450
it’s ridiculous. %$* 450
most of them were special forces, former special forces commandos or many of them went on to form their own drug cartel, the zetas. %$* 450
which our government says is the most sophisticated, technologically advanced, and dangerous cartel operating in mexico. %$* 450
and the number-one organization responsible for most of the narcotic-related homicides, beheadings, kidnappings and extortions that take place in mexico. %$* 450
but it’s not just the military. %$* 450
the cartels are working with the current administration as well. %$* 450
last year more than a dozen ranking or former officials of the calderón administration, were arrested for passing tips on to the drug traffickers. %$* 450
one of them, mexico’s former drug czar. %$* 450
so if you want to talk seriously about this drug war, you’ve gotta talk seriously about the undeniable, institutionalized level of corruption, within the mexican government. %$* 450
we need to stop talking around the issues, we’ve got enough laws. %$* 450
everything the drug cartels are doing is already illegal, a hundred different ways on both sides of the border. %$* 450
we don’t need more laws, we’ve got all the tools we need. %$* 450
we’ve got the know-how, we’ve got the tools, the intelligence. %$* 450
what’s lacking is the guts, the political backbone to look each other in truth, and have an honest discussion about this issue. %$* 450
instead of talking around the issues with some superficial discussion about how gun laws, which are going to continue to be ignored by criminals, could somehow make the difference. %$* 450
nothing—and until we do that, nothing’s going to change and people on both sides of the border, will continue to pay the price with their lives. %$* 450
thank you. %$* 450
thank you, chris cox. %$* 13
our motion is “america is to blame for mexico’s drug war,” and to debate next for the motion, andrés martinez of the new america foundation, andrés was born in mexico but came to this country and went to a bunch of ivy league schools and then he discovered pittsburgh and the post-gazette and became a writer, an editorial writer, and since has written and been on the editorial boards of papers such as the wall street journal, the washington post, the new york times, and i give you, ladies and gentlemen, andrés martinez. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 451
first off i want to make clear that i understand that some of professor castañeda’s students are in the auditorium. %$* 451
and i think it’s very important to reiterate and remind you that your vote is secret at the end of this, so— your grades will not be affected by coming to the right side here. %$* 451
and i want to thank the rosenkranz foundation for holding this debate. %$* 451
as john mentioned, i grew up in mexico in the 1970s, in the northern state of chihuahua, and the capitol city of the same name. %$* 451
and back then it was a pretty easygoing mid-size city. %$* 451
my friends and i wouldn’t really think twice about hitchhiking home from school, or hopping on a city bus to go downtown to watch a movie, then grab a taco at our favorite hole-in-the-wall joint, our parents didn’t really worry much about us then. %$* 451
i don’t mean to suggest that chihuahua was denmark. %$* 451
the state does sit on the border with the united states. %$* 451
and while the bulk of the hard drug trade in those days as fareed mentioned, went through the caribbean, there were plenty of trafficking organizations in the mountains of chihuahua near the city. %$* 451
but we weren’t really aware of this, there was no violence, i didn’t even know anyone who did drugs. %$* 451
i got my first exposure to the consumer end of the pipeline when i came to school in the states. %$* 451
and it’s actually important to make clear that, contrary to something that was suggested earlier, consumption rates in mexico still remain very low and that’s something we can explore later in the debate. %$* 451
the state of chihuahua only became a bloody battleground, its border city of ciudad juarez synonymous practically with murder, after the us clamped down on the caribbean routes via miami once favored by the cartels. %$* 451
and that is what transformed mexico into the global hub of the trade for drugs. %$* 451
i was talking to a childhood friend recently in chihuahua and he told me that the city bears little resemblance to the place that we grew up in, and that he doesn’t dare now leave his kids out of sight. %$* 451
lest they be kidnapped or caught in the crossfire between the cartels, or between the cartels and the security forces. %$* 451
i am proud i grew up in mexico, and i’m even more proud to be an american. %$* 451
which is why it’s doubly painful for me to acknowledge that america is responsible for what’s happened to chihuahua, and that america is to blame for mexico’s drug war. %$* 451
the united states cannot continue to have it both ways. %$* 451
we americans need to make a choice. %$* 451
either we get serious about clamping down on the consumption of illegal drugs, or we should legalize them. %$* 451
wherever you come down on the moral health, economic merits of criminalizing versus legalizing drugs, please acknowledge that a continuation of the hypocritical status quo, which criminalizes socially accepted behavior, undermines the rule of law, both in our country, and in countries overrun by the goons who arbitrage between our supposed morality, and our actual behavior. %$* 451
that may all sound a bit abstract. %$* 451
what’s a little erosion of the rule of law between friends. %$* 451
until you start counting the corpses piling up south of the border. %$* 451
they are closing in on 15,000 just since president calderón took office in late 2006.and that’s nearly three times the number of us servicemen killed in iraq and afghanistan this decade. %$* 451
so let’s not be distracted by talk of corruption in mexico or what percentage of guns in mexico comes from where. %$* 451
our debate isn’t about whether mexico is like denmark, or about america’s gun laws. %$* 451
it is about what happens to a nation that shares a 2,000-mile border with the richest nation on earth when that richest nation on earth insists on consuming some $65 billion worth of drugs a year, and insists on ceding control of that market, of that industry, to offshore criminal organizations. %$* 451
there’s an old saying in mexico, perhaps you’ve heard it. %$* 451
“poor mexico, so far from god, so close to the united states.” but the real curse isn’t merely proximity to america. %$* 451
it’s being sandwiched between america’s insatiable demand for illicit drugs, and the sources of the most valuable of those drugs, the coca fields in colombia and bolivia. %$* 451
so let’s not be confused. %$* 451
whatever mexico’s shortcomings are, and there are plenty %$* 451
and say canada’s virtues, whatever those are— if our two neighboring countries %$* 451
traded places, we’d be here talking about a canadian war tonight. %$* 451
geography sometimes is destiny. %$* 451
as americans we believe in individual empowerment and the concept that our actions have consequences. %$* 451
as consumers we may shun products that harm the environment, maybe you buy fair-trade coffee. %$* 451
you know, we believe that our choices have consequences. %$* 451
on college campuses students have long thought globally but acted locally. %$* 451
you know, they mobilize against overseas sweatshops %$* 451
or they press institutions to to divest from investments that may harm people in darfur or elsewhere. %$* 451
when i was in college in the states, the issue of the day was divestment from south africa. %$* 451
activists erected shantytowns on campus to pressure the college to stop investing in companies that were doing business there. %$* 451
again, a laudable impulse. %$* 451
but even then i was struck by how some of these activists disregarded their socially responsible investment creed, when it came to recreational drugs. %$* 451
their cash after all was underwriting the murder of elected officials, judges, and policemen in colombia. %$* 451
as fareed said back then that was the hub, and now it’s shifted to mexico. %$* 451
and i do worry that we still haven’t made that connection. %$* 451
i actually shared this view with a girlfriend at the time in college, as an argument for our not indulging, and that may have hastened the demise of our relationship. %$* 451
she didn’t quite call me buzzkill martinez but maybe she did and i’ve omitted that memory. %$* 451
i must say though, president obama to his credit has acknowledged this nexus. %$* 451
saying that as the ultimate consumers of the drugs flowing north, we have a shared responsibility with mexico in confronting its war. %$* 451
so we should count him as a member of our team here tonight. %$* 451
and even ronald reagan back in 1988 meeting with president de la madrid said similar things, that the solution to the problem was for americans to quit buying illegal drugs. %$* 451
and i would suggest another option, as has been suggested, is decriminalization. %$* 451
but we can’t continue to have it both ways. %$* 451
i recently read a best-selling book in mexico by an author i respect a great deal, and from whom i’ve learned a lot. %$* 451
and on page 85 of that book, he wrote that the us wants mexico %$* 451
“to wage the war and provide the corpses, so it doesn’t have to.” and he refers to the us as exporting its internal conflict on drugs. %$* 451
the author of this book, and i’m sorry, jorge, to pile on, but— you’re such prolific writer. %$* 451
the book is excellent. %$* 451
is jorge castañeda of course, and, there’s still time, jorge, for you to switch sides and come over to— to join us and presidents obama and reagan. %$* 451
but i look forward to continuing this conversation, and thank you so much for your interest. %$* 451
thank you, andrés martinez. %$* 13
well, our next debater is jorge castañeda and as you’ve heard his words keep coming back to bite him tonight, that’s because he writes an awful lot, jorge served as mexico’s foreign minister in the early 2000’s, also your dad as well held that position back in the ‘70s, am i correct— %$* 13
that’s right. %$* 452
he is also on the faculty here at new york university, ladies and gentlemen, jorge castañeda. %$* 13
very quickly first for my students, in mexico we have ways of knowing how you vote. %$* 452
be careful. %$* 452
secondly, this is a tilted playing field. %$* 452
because on that side, i have two of my current and former bosses and that’s not fair. %$* 452
andrés martinez is my boss at the new america foundation, and fareed had been my boss at newsweek magazine for a long, long period of time. %$* 452
so obviously, you know, i feel somewhat constrained. %$* 452
my point is very simple here. %$* 452
the united states is not to blame for mexico’s drug war, mexico is not to blame for mexico’s drug war, president felipe calderón is to blame for mexico’s drug war, a war of choice that he should not have declared, that cannot be won, and is doing enormous damage to mexico. %$* 452
it was started on false premises, that mexican consumption had grown by 2006 which is false according to the government’s own health statistics. %$* 452
not only has mexican consumption not grown, it is lower than the consumption not only of the united states and western europe, but of practically all of latin america. %$* 452
it was premised on an increase in violence in mexico through 2006, which is also false. %$* 452
willful homicides had been decreasing mexico, for the previous 15 years, down to levels way below those of central america, brazil, colombia, et cetera, though still higher than the united states. %$* 452
thirdly, it was premised on a loss of state capacity to enforce the law in mexico, from what you’ve heard here and quite rightly on both sides of the table, that state capacity in mexico has never been immense, and it’s not necessarily worse today than it was before. %$* 452
yes, there is corruption in mexico, the point is there is more corruption today than there was 20, 25 years ago. %$* 452
i say no there isn’t. %$* 452
and finally, this was also a war that was predicated on the issue, that there was a current explosion of war, which had to be stopped, it cannot be stopped. %$* 452
why did president calderón declare this war of choice? %$* 452
because he felt that he needed to legitimize himself in the view of the mexican people, because his election was questioned. %$* 452
fareed, i’m sorry on this point, i tried to run against president— candidate calderón, and wasn’t allowed to, and supported him actively, and wrote in many of the places i wrote and that you all quote, that i actively supported, called on readers to vote for him, supported him actively, during the campaign, during the election, and during the post-election discussion on whether the election was free and fair, which i thought it was. %$* 452
i thought he won, most mexicans thought he won, but he decided that he had to legitimize himself in the eyes of the mexican people for a questioned election. %$* 452
and he thought that this was the way to do it, by calling the army out into the streets, donning a military uniform for the first time in 50 years of mexican history, and trying to achieve, through the war on drugs, what he could have achieved in a much more useful way. %$* 452
this war cannot be won, simply because it is failing to comply with the fundamental tenets of a very good friend of mine, that some of you may know, colin powell’s view of the first gulf war. %$* 452
to go into war like this, you need to have overwhelming force, we don’t have it. %$* 452
you need to have a definition of victory, we don’t have it. %$* 452
you need to have an exit strategy, we don’t have it. %$* 452
and you should have the support of the mexican people in this case, which president calderón does have, but he’s running out of it very quickly. %$* 452
is the us to blame for this? %$* 452
i tend to think it’s not directly to blame, although there is a case to be made for the consumption and arms argument. %$* 452
the problem with the consumption argument, is that if the united states is going to reduce consumption significantly, well, it’s time to do so. %$* 452
and frankly that doesn’t seem to be what american society wants to do. %$* 452
i don’t see the united states wanting to reduce american consumption or demand. %$* 452
frankly, if i was an american citizen and was asked to vote on this question, i would vote against reducing us consumption. %$* 452
why bother? %$* 452
there’re much more intelligent things to do with us consumption, i believe, than trying to reduce it. %$* 452
for example, legalize or decriminalize the consumption of as many drugs as is reasonable right now. %$* 452
start with what you can, see what happens, and then move forward. %$* 452
is there an alternative issue—approach, of course there is. %$* 452
we don’t have to proceed the way president calderón has, we don’t have to proceed the way both the bush and obama administration, who on this point, are exactly identical in their policy toward mexico %$* 452
we don’t have to proceed the way calderón has proceeded and the way bush and obama have supported him. %$* 452
we don’t have to declare a war on all the cartels all the time as carlos fuentes has said. %$* 452
we can do either what the colombians did, combat collateral damages. %$* 452
we can pursue a policy of harm reduction in mexico. %$* 452
and we can pursue a policy in the united states, mexicans, we mexicans, of trying to lobby in the united states in favor of decriminalization where it can be done. %$* 452
but we certainly don’t have to go to war with more than 15,000 people already killed in drug-related killings, and the number rising every week, every month, every year. %$* 452
we have far more executions today in mexico, than we had four years ago. %$* 452
but the last point i want to make is the most absurd one. %$* 452
we have tens of people dying every day in tijuana. %$* 452
on the border, with the united states. %$* 452
sometimes, 50, 60, 70.and, they are there basically dying to stop mexican marijuana, among other drugs, from entering the united states. %$* 452
the small problem is that 120 miles north of tijuana, in los angeles, there are more public, legal dispensaries of medical marijuana than public schools. %$* 452
there are more than a thousand medical dispensaries of marijuana in los angeles, perfectly legal. %$* 452
so we have our guys dying south of the border, to stop the marijuana from entering the united states, and being sold legally in los angeles. %$* 452
i think there’s something fundamentally wrong with that idea, it doesn’t work, it’s a war that cannot be won, it’s a war that should not have been waged, and it’s a war that we should call off promptly. %$* 452
the united states is not to blame for it, mexico is not to blame for it, it’s a war of choice that president calderón declared for strictly political reasons, thank you. %$* 452
thank you, jorge castañeda. %$* 13
and that concludes round 1 of this intelligence squared debate. %$* 13
our motion is, “america is to blame for mexico’s drug war,” and we now have the results of where you our live audience stood before this debate began. %$* 13
you are the judges in this debate, you’re voting both before and again at the end, and the team that changes the most of your minds will be declared our winner. %$* 13
here are the results where things started at the beginning. %$* 13
our motion is “america is to blame for mexico’s drug war,” at the start, 43 percent of you were for %$* 13
22 percent against, and 35 percent undecided. %$* 13
so we’ll have you vote once again at the end of the debate, and the team that changes the most minds will be declared our winner. %$* 13
on now to round 2 of this intelligence squared us debate, it’s our middle round, in which the debaters talk directly to one another, can challenge one another, and also we’ll take questions from myself and from you in the audience, and i’d like to start by asking you, fareed, the point that jorge castañeda just made that, mexico’s drug war basically is the fault of one man %$* 13
do you buy it? %$* 13
i’m a little confused listening to that whole team because, asa hutchinson says, consumption is down. %$* 447
jorge castañeda says consumption is up. %$* 447
i mean i’ve welcomed diversity but this is ridiculous. %$* 447
and more fundamentally it seems as though there is a contradiction here which is %$* 447

okay, then i’m going to go ahead and introduce the man responsible for this whole shebang here, robert rosenkranz, who is chairman of the rosenkranz foundation, the sponsor of intelligence squared, who’s going to frame tonight’s debate. %$* 510
bob? %$* 510
thank you. %$* 1
well, you know, the notion of a market in human organs, just strikes many as ethically or morally repugnant. %$* 1
certainly those who choose to sell their organs will be predominantly poor. %$* 1
and, is it not exploitation to take advantage of their duress? %$* 1
doesn’t this make the growing inequalities between rich and poor rise to a new and disturbing level? %$* 1
is the human dignity of people who sell their organs compromised? %$* 1
and, and more pragmatically, might the existence of a market create incentives for fraud or dishonesty. %$* 1
might it undermine the altruism that drives our current model. %$* 1
well, it’s hard to dispute that the current model has serious flaws. %$* 1
some 75,000 in this country are on the waiting list for kidney transplants. %$* 1
in the next year, only 18,000 will receive them. %$* 1
within that year nearly 4000 will die, another 1200 or more will become too sick to transplant. %$* 1
those on dialysis, have a seriously impaired quality of life, and about half the life expectancy of those receiving transplants. %$* 1
the argument in favor of a market solution, is grounded in basic economics. %$* 1
if you want to increase the supply of available organs, you need to create incentives for donors, is the argument. %$* 1
the easiest case may be a family death benefit, for those who agree to be organ donors when they apply for driver’s licenses, and whose organs are actually used. %$* 1
this addresses the need for livers, lungs, hearts and other transplantable organs. %$* 1
but kidney transplants are the most common, the only organ available from living donors. %$* 1
the—and this is a case that dramatizes the nexus between freedom of contract and personal liberty. %$* 1
suppose you or your child needs a kidney, and you agree to pay a sum, say $25,000, to a donor. %$* 1
well in many parts of the world, such a sum is life-changing. %$* 1
suppose $25,000 enables the donor to get health care for his parents, or an education for his children. %$* 1
both sides to this bargain receive benefits powerful to them. %$* 1
and there’s no obvious harm to anybody else. %$* 1
so why should this contract be illegal? %$* 1
when legislators who find such bargains repugnant pass laws imposing their views, they are quite literally causing sick people to die. %$* 1
how can this be morally acceptable? %$* 1
before closing, i’d like to note that this is the final debate of our spring season, and our final debate at asia society. %$* 1
this has been a wonderful venue for us, but all of our debates have been sold out and we’ve had to turn hundreds away. %$* 1
we begin again in september at casprey auditorium at rockefeller university, 66th street and york avenue. %$* 1
our new venue is substantially bigger and will meet the demand for the kind of elevated public discourse we at iq squared try to provide. %$* 1
tonight’s resolution is a great example. %$* 1
it raises issues of ethics and economics, and morality, and mortality. %$* 1
we have an outstanding panel and a stellar moderator in ira flatow, a veteran npr science correspondent, award-winning tv journalist. %$* 1
ira, the evening is yours. %$* 1
thank you, bob, thank you very much, bob rosenkranz. %$* 510
if at any time during the evening you forget what we’re talking about, right behind me, is a big billboard %$* 510
with the names of the guests and panelists, we’ve divided them up into %$* 510
i’m not gonna say left and right, let’s just say pro and con or for and against, for and against is how we’ll describe it. %$* 510
the topic for discussion is, “we should legalize the market for human organs,” pro or con, yes or no, and you actually vote, if you look at the keypad—there’s a keypad attached to the armrest on your left, it should look something like this. %$* 510
no money is going to come out of it if you put in a— well, i don’t know, maybe something will happen. %$* 510
now when i prompt you, we’re gonna do—we’re going to take a vote before and then after the debate, and see if your mind has been changed or if you have any different ideas after listening to the debate. %$* 510
and so after i prompt you, press “1” for the motion, “we should legalize the market for human organs,” or “2” to vote against. %$* 510
and if you’re one of the great undecideds, you can even go for “3.” so it is “1” for the motion, “2” against, and “3” if you are undecided. %$* 510
you can vote now. %$* 510
do i do the “jeopardy” music here? %$* 510
i don’t think so. %$* 510
we’re going to reveal the outcome of the votes later in the evening, but let’s get right on to the main topic of discussion. %$* 510
i’m going to introduce the panel, and, they’re all well-known people so please, hold your applause until all six are introduced. %$* 510
now we have for the motion, professor of law at the end of the table, at george mason university, lloyd cohen. %$* 510
he’s director of transplantation and professor of surgery at suny upstate medical university, amy friedman— segued too fast to amy friedman. %$* 510
okay. %$* 511
she’s director of transplantation and professor of surgery at suny upstate medical university. %$* 510
next to her is sally satel, she is a psychiatrist and resident scholar at the american enterprise institute for public policy research. %$* 510
against the motion on my left, we have the professor of ethics at the university of virginia, and director of the institute for practical ethics in public life, james childress. %$* 510
welcome. %$* 510
professor of surgery at harvard medical school and director of medical affairs for the transplantation society, francis delmonico. %$* 510
and on the end, professor of social medicine and director of the center on medicine as a profession at columbia university, david rothman. %$* 510
welcome all to the program, let’s begin the debate. %$* 510
i’m going call each member of the debating team to the podium, in order, and they’re going to give us their viewpoint and then we’ll move on from there and continue our debate, and first up, in the order of debate, for the proposition is sally satel. %$* 510
sally? %$* 510
thank you. %$* 512
today there are 75,000 people waiting for kidneys. %$* 512
i would still be one of them, but thank goodness, a wonderful friend of mine gave me her right kidney two years ago. %$* 512
but thousands of others are not going to be as lucky as i was. %$* 512
in new york city in fact, patients suffer on dialysis, can suffer for up to eight years before getting a transplant, and so many of them can’t survive that long. %$* 512
despite decades and decades of public education about the virtues of organ donation, the waiting list just gets longer, and the time to transplantation just gets longer. %$* 512
so it’s no surprise that desperate patients take matters into their own hands and try to find their own organs. %$* 512
they rent billboards begging people to give them—to save them. %$* 512
they join on-line matching services to find a donor, in fact i did that. %$* 512
some of them go abroad, and maybe if they go abroad to a place like china, they have to live with the sickening knowledge that the organ they got came from an executed prisoner. %$* 512
but you can’t blame these people. %$* 512
they are just trying to save their lives. %$* 512
now bless all the altruistic souls who have donated organs. %$* 512
but it’s past time to face the fact that altruism is just not enough. %$* 512
many people need more of an incentive to give. %$* 512
and that’s why we need to be able to compensate people who are willing to give a kidney to a stranger, to save a life. %$* 512
here’s one proposal. %$* 512
the government should sponsor a regulated system for living donors. %$* 512
compensation could be something as simple as a contribution to a retirement fund, a tax credit, tuition voucher for the children, possibly health care, all kinds of creative things we could do to benefit people who are willing to give a kidney. %$* 512
and as i said, since the government will be paying, not the patient, everyone can benefit. %$* 512
now what about the donors. %$* 512
would the promise of a reward exploit donors whose poverty makes the offer seem impossible to refuse? %$* 512
that’s an important consideration. %$* 512
but a distinction needs to be made. %$* 512
it’s not low-income people who will rush to judgment, and make rash decisions. %$* 512
it’s desperate people. %$* 512
no one wants someone giving up a kidney because they’re in such financial desperation. %$* 512
but, this is something we can guard against. %$* 512
for example we simply don’t offer what desperate people want. %$* 512
which is immediate cash. %$* 512
so you can build in several months of a waiting period, you can offer the kind of in-kind compensation i mentioned before. %$* 512
i mean, i can go on and on about details of how a system could be constructed. %$* 512
but, you get the idea, i mean you’ve heard the basic idea. %$* 512
now, what i want to do, is have you hear some of the misguided objections that our opponents are going to wage. %$* 512
you may well hear that any effort to legalize rewards for donors, will end up creating a system that will look exactly like the corrupt organ bazaars that permeate the third world, in this donors are almost considered no more than cattle, and their organs go to the highest bidder. %$* 512
that is exactly wrong. %$* 512
we are talking about a transparent, regulated system of exchange, under the rule of law, in which donor protections are paramount. %$* 512
in fact, what we’re talking about is the exact opposite of a black market. %$* 512
the donor is free to decide if participating is in his best interest, and then if it is, something miraculous happens. %$* 512
he saves someone with his kidney. %$* 512
you may also hear that the transplant list is really not that bad, it’s kind of bogus, it’s inflated. %$* 512
really, we don’t have to do anything drastic. %$* 512
well, we do have to do something drastic, because, of the 75,000 people on the list, it is true, not every one of them is eligible to get a kidney tomorrow. %$* 512
about a third of them are what’s called inactive, meaning that right now they are too sick, if a kidney became available to them tomorrow, they would have to be passed over, because they’re not ready to— they’re too fragile for surgery. %$* 512
but why did that happen? %$* 512
it happened because they waited years and years and deteriorated so far during that time, that now they couldn’t get an organ. %$* 512
tragically these were people who were healthy when they were first listed. %$* 512
so if anything, the glut, the one-third of folks who are ineligible to get a kidney today, is a sign for urgency, not complacency. %$* 512
you’ll also hear that the transactions involving organs, any transaction involving organs, is an affront to human dignity. %$* 512
but no one can ever explain to me how a fair, safe, and respectable implementation of incentives is an affront to anyone. %$* 512
but what is a disgraceful assault on human dignity, is to sit by and let people die when we have the means to save them. %$* 512
you’ll hear that organs and material gain don’t mix. %$* 512
well, i reject this. %$* 512
beautiful acts are performed every day by people who are moved by a combination of humanitarian and financial motives. %$* 512
are firemen who rush into a burning building any less heroic in our eyes because they were paid to save us? %$* 512
in the end, our critics have a chilling message for patients. %$* 512
shut up, wait on line, and pray that you’re not one of the 14 people who will die today because no organ became available for you. %$* 512
now don’t get me wrong, altruism is a beautiful virtue. %$* 512
it should and will continue if there is a parallel system— %$* 512
—of compensating donation. %$* 512
i know it’s a beautiful virtue because i’m a poster girl for it. %$* 512
but i also know the deadly consequences of following the same failed policy. %$* 512
it’s something we can’t do, and why you must vote for our side. %$* 512
thank you. %$* 512
one minute, one minute— %$* 510
—of compensating donation. %$* 512
i know it’s a beautiful virtue because i’m a poster girl for it. %$* 512
but i also know the deadly consequences of following the same failed policy. %$* 512
it’s something we can’t do, and why you must vote for our side. %$* 512
thank you. %$* 512
thank you, sally. %$* 510
up next speaking against the resolution, is james childress. %$* 510
defenders of markets for organs often charge that the opponents of a market appeal to the emotions of repugnance, and disgust, the yuck factor. %$* 513
they often imply that the only grounds any reasonable person could have for rejecting a market would be such emotions. %$* 513
well tonight, we, the opponents of an organ market, will not appeal primarily to emotions. %$* 513
indeed, i suspect that the proponents of a market will do so. %$* 513
instead we will offer solid ethical, social, and cultural reasons not to legalize a market in organs. %$* 513
we ask you to consider very carefully, the reasons, the arguments for and against organ markets. %$* 513
defenders of organ markets also tend to represent an extreme form of what i would call market fundamentalism. %$* 513
they suppose that, any time there’s a problem, such as shortage of organs, we should just throw that problem into the marketplace, and magically, miraculously, the problem will be solved. %$* 513
market fundamentalism neglects the full range of relevant social values, especially justice and fairness which i will emphasize, and the probable negative effects of a market in organs, which my colleagues will stress. %$* 513
markets are truly wonderful mechanisms. %$* 513
but they may not be the best mechanism, for organ transfers. %$* 513
defenders of organ markets appeal to two great social-ethical values, very important ones. %$* 513
liberty, people should be free to sell their body parts if they want to. %$* 513
utility, a market in organs would produce the greatest good for the greatest number. %$* 513
libertarians affirming liberty, utilitarians affirming utility, take these values and join together in an unstable alliance, in support of a market in organs. %$* 513
but both neglect another equally important value, justice, or fairness. %$* 513
as a result they ignore or downplay the injustice or unfairness of exploiting poor and disadvantaged people, as sources of transplantable organs. %$* 513
an illegal or legal organ markets, the main vendors or sellers, and yes, that’s what they are. %$* 513
they’re not paid donors, they are vendors and sellers. %$* 513
they tend to be poor and disadvantaged, or desperate. %$* 513
of course we could devise a system of compensation for organs that would avoid some injustice and some unfairness, by separating procurement from distribution. %$* 513
take the unfairness of a rich person’s purchase of organs. %$* 513
we can eliminate that, by having a single purchaser of organs, who would then distribute the organs according to a fair scheme, for example, to patients most in need. %$* 513
but we cannot avoid the poor, disadvantaged, desperate person’s sale. %$* 513
and we should not introduce an organ market into a society with major and increasing inequalities in wealth and advantage. %$* 513
if we did so, we would not, should not expect a positive outcome. %$* 513
why not. %$* 513
well consider two possibilities. %$* 513
one possible target of an organ market or compensation system, would aim to increase—would be to increase the number of organs from dead people. %$* 513
let’s call those cadaveric organs. %$* 513
another would be to increase the organs from living vendors. %$* 513
some of the same objections apply to both, for example financial compensation may crowd out donation, especially altruistic donation. %$* 513
but there are differences. %$* 513
take first a cadaveric organ market. %$* 513
there are strong reasons to believe that compensation for cadaveric organs won’t increase the supply. %$* 513
imagine a futures market in organs where individuals contract to provide their organs after their deaths, and in return receive a payment now, or designate the payment to be provided after their deaths to their families, or to a charity. %$* 513
why wouldn’t that work, it seems so obvious. %$* 513
well, consider that many people don’t sign donor cards now because of distrust or mistrust. %$* 513
they worry about being declared dead prematurely, or even having their deaths hastened, if they have signed a donor card. %$* 513
well they would certainly be reluctant to enter a futures market, to sign a futures contract, when the only barrier to the delivery of their organs, is the fact that they’re not dead yet. %$* 513
or consider the family sale. %$* 513
individuals would have similar reasons to block families from making decisions because of conflicts of interest. %$* 513
and many families would be reluctant to be viewed as profiting from a family member’s death. %$* 513
we do not need to try such a futile market. %$* 513
there are other options for obtaining cadaveric organs. %$* 513
our current system works fairly well, and can be improved. %$* 513
indeed, we’re second only to spain in the number of deceased donor organs obtained per million population. %$* 513
and there are several potential improvements that we can make, some are already underway. %$* 513
we can increase education and the use of donor cards and donor registries. %$* 513
and, when an individual’s not made a decision, we can do a better job in approaching— approaching families after their deaths. %$* 513
some institutions now obtain consent to donation, from 70 to 75 percent of families of patients declared dead by neurological standards, who are potential candidates for organ donation. %$* 513
and we can consider other sources including those declared dead by cardiopulmonary standards. %$* 513
but now let’s consider a living organ market, mainly for kidneys since people can live, usually live and function well with only one of their two kidneys. %$* 513
in 2007 there were roughly 7250 deceased kidney donors, and 6000 living kidney donors— %$* 513
a living organ market would probably work better than compensation with cadaveric organs, but there are other problems that my colleagues will emphasize. %$* 513
in conclusion %$* 513
a market is not an idea whose time has come. %$* 513
a market in organs is a bad idea. %$* 513
it is unnecessary, probably ineffective, possibly counterproductive, and would breach our sense of justice by exploiting poor, disadvantaged, and desperate members of our society. %$* 513
hence we should not legalize a market in human organs. %$* 513
one minute. %$* 510
a living organ market would probably work better than compensation with cadaveric organs, but there are other problems that my colleagues will emphasize. %$* 513
in conclusion %$* 513

hence we should not legalize a market in human organs. %$* 513
thank you, james childress. %$* 510
up next, for, is amy friedman. %$* 510
as a surgeon, i view the body with reverence. %$* 511
the rights and dignity of every patient are paramount. %$* 511
my expertise is to—is sustaining lives by transplanting organs. %$* 511
it is my inability to do so, because i don’t have the organs to offer, that has persuaded me that rewarding the donor is appropriate. %$* 511
our opponents tonight would have me tell patients to stay the course. %$* 511
wait with dignity for the organ that may never come. %$* 511
this message is poorly received, as it should be. %$* 511
our opponents may tell you, that the waiting list is too long, because it includes the wrong people. %$* 511
i don’t see wrong people, i see human beings, each of whose lives might well be lengthened and improved if i could give them an organ. %$* 511
desperate patients unwilling to die waiting have fueled a black market, whose magnitude is inadequately quantified, though certainly disturbing in scope. %$* 511
what is known, is that organs are purchased, third-party brokers siphon funds away from donors, and safety is uncertain for both the recipient or the donor. %$* 511
efforts to shut this market have been as unsuccessful as prohibition was in inducing an end to the use of alcohol. %$* 511
i agree with our opponents that the black market must be closed. %$* 511
i disagree with asking patients to accept death gracefully, instead of resorting to the black market. %$* 511
my position is that development of a legal, regulated mechanism for donor compensation is the only means of effectively eliminating the demand for this covert activity, closing down the black market, and improving safety for donors and recipients. %$* 511
today, we educate the kidney patient and family, hoping that a volunteer donor will step forward to surrender a kidney. %$* 511
most transplant surgeons agree, there would be no justification for ever removing a kidney from a living donor, potentially causing harm to this healthy person, if there were sufficient organs from deceased donors. %$* 511
why? %$* 511
it may surprise you, that we still cannot tell this volunteer donor about all of the risks that kidney donation entails. %$* 511
sure, the early risks, such as death, are known, but the long-term consequences are not, particularly for some of the more marginal donors being used in some cases. %$* 511
nevertheless, we allow and celebrate such a healthy person’s choice to donate, and allow him to accept unknown risks for which there is no compensation. %$* 511
why are we surprised that more donations don’t take place? %$* 511
transplanters share nearly universal agreement, that these genuine heroes need lifelong health insurance and intermittent medical supervision. %$* 511
dr. %$* 511
delmonico has written that all living donors should be provided with life and disability insurance. %$* 511
but in today’s reality, we have no mechanism for providing these protections. %$* 511
yet we are not deterred from removing the kidney. %$* 511
the operation itself, and our fees, are covered by the recipient’s insurance. %$* 511
the opportunity to save a life persuades us and the donor to proceed. %$* 511
compensation for the organ donor’s time and risks, by providing life insurance, lifelong health insurance, and even a direct monetary fee, is more appropriate than for the donation of an egg, the rental of a uterus for a surrogate pregnancy, or the participation in clinical experimentation, all of which are legal. %$* 511
we are talking about saving lives. %$* 511
let’s also recognize that everyone else involved in the transplant prospers. %$* 511
the recipient gains the organ, life itself. %$* 511
the surgeons, transplant center, and for kidney transplants, even the american taxpayer, you and i, have direct financial benefit when a patient comes off dialysis. %$* 511
isn’t it disingenuous to exclude the donor from sharing in the tangible benefits resulting from his gift of life? %$* 511
a reasonable system must include protection from nefarious third parties, and be guaranteed by centralized, independent oversight, that ensures equal accessibility to those in need, regardless of their economic means. %$* 511
lastly and most crucially, a transparent, informed consent process must be the mandatory condition of participation. %$* 511
our opponents may suggest that payment would be so coerced, as to prevent the donor from giving informed consent. %$* 511
this is paternalistic. %$* 511
why should financial need prevent one’s ability to consider the balanced presentations of risk and benefit that donors consider in the currently regulated informed-consent process. %$* 511
this is an insult to the poor, in suggesting they are incapable of balanced thought and self-determination. %$* 511
reasonable people rationalize risk daily, by personal prerogative, at times subjecting themselves to unhealthy conditions, and making unsafe choices such as working deep in the coalmine. %$* 511
any informed decision balances risk against the prospect of benefit. %$* 511
though real, the risks of organ donation are likely substantially lower than those assumed by coal miners seeking their livelihoods. %$* 511
despite the dangers inherent in both cases, the miner but not the donor is legally compensated for these risks. %$* 511
the key difference is dependence on the participation of medical providers, white house are dedicated to doing no harm, to facilitate payment for the gift of life. %$* 511
therefore, according a donor— %$* 511
—the highest degree of protection throughout necessitates the involvement of the most highly-trained individuals, and the conditions of greatest safety. %$* 511
this is precisely what does not happen on the black market, where transplants and donations are conducted covertly. %$* 511
there is no dignity in dying without a transplant. %$* 511
don’t blame the patient for listening to his internal will to live. %$* 511
we must offer protection to the donor who answers the recipient’s call, in a way that is currently legally prohibited. %$* 511
vote with us to legitimize compensation for the donor’s acceptance of risk. %$* 511
today, the choice is not whether compensation will exchange hands, but whether or not transplant operations and the sale of organs will be regulated and safe. %$* 511
one minute, one minute— %$* 510
—the highest degree of protection throughout necessitates the involvement of the most highly-trained individuals, and the conditions of greatest safety. %$* 511

thank you. %$* 510
up next, speaking against the resolution is francis delmonico. %$* 510
so i’m a transplant surgeon, and i’ve been involved in transplantation care, oh, for more than 35 years. %$* 514
and, i’ve had the opportunity to travel around this world, to know about transplantation practices, and what we’re discussing here tonight. %$* 514
i mentioned to robert, wherever he is, that there’s a global impact, of what would be from the united states. %$* 514
what we do here, has a profound influence on the rest of the world. %$* 514
now, i say that because i’ve been to manila. %$* 514
and amy, i should say, it’s not a matter of balanced thought, when a 14-year-old has to sell a kidney, to an american that comes there. %$* 514
it’s not a matter of balanced thought in pakistan, or in egypt. %$* 514
what’s been missing, in what you’ve heard, is what would that system look like. %$* 514
legalize the market for human organs, what would that be. %$* 514
amy has mentioned that %$* 514
shouldn’t be a black market. %$* 514
shouldn’t be covert. %$* 514
it’s not a black market in the sense of covert in manila, or in lahore, pakistan, or in egypt. %$* 514
it’s very well-known. %$* 514
it’s very transparent, and aware what the situation is. %$* 514
what’s been missing in the debate thus far is, what would this look like, or have to look like, in the united states. %$* 514
and is that indeed attainable. %$* 514
so, if we are to go down this road of a market, what might that be that—we haven’t actually heard, what might that be, to make it transparent, or regulated. %$* 514
well, there’d have to be a fixed price for the kidney. %$* 514
now i wanna say something that comes across my mind %$* 514
i wish to provide care for donors. %$* 514
there should be no mistaking that, and i wish to expand every opportunity there can be, in providing for the people on this list. %$* 514
and that entails care for live donors, that does not exist. %$* 514
but it can’t be a cash payment. %$* 514
it can’t be a market, given the global context of medical tourism and markets. %$* 514
so let me take you back to %$* 514
what would this be. %$* 514
well, those that have written about this say it would have to be a fixed price. %$* 514
there’d have to be a prohibition of brokers. %$* 514
there’d have to be a prohibition of internet arrangements. %$* 514
the kidneys would have to be distributed along with deceased donor kidneys, by the unos system. %$* 514
the kidneys would only be available by this, quote- unquote, market system. %$* 514
the vendors and the buyers would have to be restricted to the country of residence. %$* 514
it would only be that the vendor could be within the united states, and so too the recipient. %$* 514
now just for a moment, i want to ask of a reality check about all of those issues, and whether or not you all could conclude that that in this global environment, of medical tourism, would indeed be attainable. %$* 514
do you think that such a market could be with a fixed price and a prohibition of brokers and a prohibition of internet arrangements and only distributed through this system. %$* 514
and that the vendors and buyers would have to be restricted to the united states. %$* 514
now, in the interest of time—we can’t go through all of those—let’s just start by thinking of that. %$* 514
fixed price for a kidney. %$* 514
fixed cash payment. %$* 514
that’s impossible. %$* 514
it’s impossible because there’s no market justification to fix a price. %$* 514
markets deal in best prices, in cheapest prices. %$* 514
patients go from the middle east to manila because it’s the cheapest price. %$* 514
and, why shouldn’t there be a cheap price, if we’re going to condone markets in the united states, what is the expectation that insurance companies, brokers and patients would simply wait here, why wouldn’t they, with now a legalize market in the united states, go and shop. %$* 514
shopping is manila, shopping is pakistan, shopping is india. %$* 514
shopping is south america. %$* 514
there are plenty of cheap prices. %$* 514
the prohibition of brokers in this regulated market. %$* 514
the insurance companies become brokers, when they send patients from israel to manila. %$* 514
it’s the cheapest price. %$* 514
about 20 patients a month go from israel to manila, because of cheap prices. %$* 514
if there’s a market legalized in the united states, in the global context of medical tourism, do you think that the 72— %$* 514
—72-year-old patient on the list, would wait for a kidney here, versus going to buy a 20-year-old kidney in manila? %$* 514
i want to bring to attention something about the list, and we’ll do more about this and we can amplify this in our discussion. %$* 514
but there is this piece that i want to just very carefully ask-- %$* 514
we better evaluate this wait list. %$* 514
the contention that all on the list would have lived had they gotten a kidney, may not be a reality either. %$* 514
and i’ll wish to amplify that, one other piece %$* 514
to say that it’s unethical not to permit kidney sales because kidney patients are dying on the list overlooks the unethical development of committing heart and lung and liver and pancreas and intestine patients to die because kidney sales will impact deceased transplantation in this country. %$* 514
it does it around the world. %$* 514
go to hong kong. %$* 514
thank you, ira. %$* 514
we’ll talk more about this aspect— %$* 514
thank you— %$* 514
so do we get to respond to that— %$* 514
fine, yes i do. %$* 514
i think that %$* 514
here’s how i think it. %$* 514
medical tourism is going to be a very important aspect for all of us in this room. %$* 514
countries are now seeking rich patients to come to that country for care. %$* 514
it becomes a very big industry. %$* 514
and, the social inequity of that is, on two ways. %$* 514
if you go to a south american country that is attracting patients to come there, they do so by then making it—patients within that country, unable to receive that care. %$* 514
because there is an internal brain drain of sort, that is intended for the rich patients to arrive there. %$* 514
deceased donation has been impacted in the middle east, because you can go to asia to buy a kidney. %$* 514
so, in this global context of medical tourism, i think our presidential candidates are gonna have to think about this, yes indeed. %$* 514
one minute. %$* 510
—72-year-old patient on the list, would wait for a kidney here, versus going to buy a 20-year-old kidney in manila? %$* 514
i want to bring to attention something about the list, and we’ll do more about this and we can amplify this in our discussion. %$* 514

go to hong kong. %$* 514
dr. %$* 510
delmonico, you— %$* 510
thank you, ira. %$* 514
sum up. %$* 510
thank you— %$* 510
we’ll talk more about this aspect— %$* 514
we’ll have more time for discussion later, we’ll have a discussion period, we’ll also have a question-and-answer period from the audience— %$* 510
thank you— %$* 514
—that you can follow up, i have a couple of— thank you very much. %$* 510
i just have a couple of follow-up questions that struck me, and you made a—raise a couple interesting points, folks on this side did also, now i’ll ask one question for each side. %$* 510
and we’ll go on to the debaters. %$* 510
and that is this question about what role do the insurance companies have in this, this is a good point that dr. %$* 510
delmonico made. %$* 510
i mean, we now have to go to our hmo’s, to our health care providers for just—they make just about every decision that influences our health care. %$* 510
are they now gonna decide whether you get a—in your system that you’re proposing—would they decide whether you’re able to get a kidney or not, you’re healthy enough, you’re not healthy enough, you should be getting one, you shouldn’t be one, i’m not gonna pay for it, i’m not gonna pay for the trip, i’m not gonna pay for the medication, whatever, what role would they have, people are so disgusted with them already, are they going to become more disgusted with a government-run system, even though it’s regulated. %$* 510
you’re going to ask a physician what role the insurance companies should have— %$* 511
yes, that’s like picking out a— %$* 510
no role. %$* 511
no, it’s— you know, in general— %$* 511
well how is that possible in the system that we have now? %$* 510
because in general the insurance companies generally follow medicare and government guidelines, and as long as the—we set up something that is reasoned, logical and supportable, it’s hard for them to not follow. %$* 511
so do we get to respond to that— %$* 514
no, we’ll get, a little later we get to respond to that. %$* 510
i’m not through with the question yet. %$* 510
so if everybody acts very reasonably then, this will work—do you know anybody who acts very reasonably all the time about things like this? %$* 510
well i—i shouldn’t comment on that. %$* 511
but i will say that, you know, the concept of how this system would be created requires, um, involvement of multiple parties, in a similar manner to the way unos is set up. %$* 511
that there are not just providers, there are not just patients and family members, there are clergy, there are social workers, and yes, i think it would be reasonable to have some representatives from the major insurance companies for example to be part in the development of these multi-disciplinary panels as they agree on what is the best policy for doing this. %$* 511
it has to be a uniform policy, and the way the law would need to be written, and we do need a law written, this is obviously currently an illegal activity, so we definitely need legislative change, would be to require that these activities go through the single processor. %$* 511
let me just ask the other doctor, dr. %$* 510
delmonico, a different question, we’ll get back to this later, you seem to feel very strongly about this issue. %$* 510
do you think this is a strong enough issue that it should be brought up in this presidential election year. %$* 510
do you think this should influence the way we choose our candidates about where they stand perhaps, on this issue. %$* 510
fine, yes i do. %$* 514
i think that %$* 514
here’s how i think it. %$* 514
medical tourism is going to be a very important aspect for all of us in this room. %$* 514
countries are now seeking rich patients to come to that country for care. %$* 514
it becomes a very big industry. %$* 514
and, the social inequity of that is, on two ways. %$* 514
if you go to a south american country that is attracting patients to come there, they do so by then making it—patients within that country, unable to receive that care. %$* 514
because there is an internal brain drain of sort, that is intended for the rich patients to arrive there. %$* 514
deceased donation has been impacted in the middle east, because you can go to asia to buy a kidney. %$* 514
so, in this global context of medical tourism, i think our presidential candidates are gonna have to think about this, yes indeed. %$* 514
good questions, if we ever ask them a question about science or health, you know, if we ever get a chance. %$* 510
okay, we’re going to— we have to move on—we have topics of discussion coming up later. %$* 510
don’t shoot the messenger. %$* 510
we have to move right along here, next up for the resolution is, lloyd cohen. %$* 510
ladies and gentlemen, i want to make the question before you as authentic and personal as possible. %$* 515
imagine that when you leave here tonight, you learn that your child’s kidneys are failing and that without a transplant she will die. %$* 515
the problem for you is how to obtain an organ for her. %$* 515
she could receive one from a living donor, but she—and both she and the donor can live quite well with one healthy kidney. %$* 515
but what if no relative or friend is both compatible and willing to donate. %$* 515
well, you look to be, a reasonably well-heeled, group, so perhaps you might pay someone to supply her this superfluous kidney, and thereby save your child’s life. %$* 515
alas, that would be illegal. %$* 515
you, the vendor, and anyone who aids you in this will be subjected to imprisonment. %$* 515
odd, isn’t it. %$* 515
that if she were attacked by an assailant, you are permitted to use deadly force to save her life. %$* 515
but when she is attacked by disease, you may not pay a willing vendor to provide an organ. %$* 515
perhaps this rests on the principle that the rich should not get what the poor are precluded from obtaining. %$* 515
well then. %$* 515
a private charity or government agency should step in and purchase organs from willing donors, and distribute them on the basis of need. %$* 515
no. %$* 515
that is also forbidden. %$* 515
no one, no institution, no government agency may pay a living donor. %$* 515
well then, perhaps she can receive a deceased donor organ. %$* 515
yes, if she is lucky. %$* 515
now as it happens something between 25 percent and 60 percent of organs suitable for transplantation, are recovered from the deceased. %$* 515
what happens to the rest. %$* 515
they are buried and burned. %$* 515
why doesn’t a private party or a charity or the government step in and purchase those life-saving organs. %$* 515
bizarre as this may sound, the law draws no distinctions between organs from the living and organs from the deceased. %$* 515
here too, offering or accepting compensation for a deceased donor organ, is a felony. %$* 515

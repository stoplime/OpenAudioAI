and it's difficult to get into dueling studies, but does he have a point that the majority-- %$* 13
or the consensus, as he put it, of the studies, should that the numbers just aren't there? %$* 13
well, i think-- %$* 585
on the one hand, he's absolutely right, that the research is not conclusive, that mobility has declined. %$* 585
there is some research from people at the chicago fed-- %$* 585
that's right. %$* 585
well, she's not done quite yet. %$* 13
i'm kidding. %$* 18
i'm kidding. %$* 18
but i think that the argument that we've seen growing income inequality happen over the last generation, over the last 30 years, income inequality has gotten worse. %$* 585
when we want to really measure this, we're kind of at a loss because we have to wait, we have to see what happens as those kids growing up in the most unequal times, what is going to happen with their outcomes, which is why i look at education, because that's what we can see today. %$* 585
we can look at those opportunities that lead to a realization of the american dream, and those opportunities are simply not there, and not there to an increasing extent. %$* 585
scott winship. %$* 13
well, you hear this a lot i think as a sort of retreating move. %$* 588
when folks acknowledge that mobility has not fallen, you do hear this argument about, "well, you know, we'll see it in today's generation," maybe. %$* 588
but i will say that the study that was done by emmanuel saez with raj chetty, who's a harvard economist that won the award for the smartest economist under 40 with seven years to spare, they look at young adults. %$* 588
they look at people who are in their late 20s. %$* 588
they measured the parental incomes in the mid-1990s. %$* 588
at that point they'd experienced rising income concentration. %$* 588
the share of income received by the top 1 percent had been rising at that point for 15 years, and it didn't show up in their results. %$* 588
so none of us can predict the future. %$* 588
we could have this debate again in 20 years. %$* 588
and if the evidence says that we did experience declining mobility, i will be as concerned about it as anyone. %$* 588
and, nick hanauer, i mean, i don't want to dwell forever on these studies, but they are the evidence we have, and your partner has conceded that there at least is not a consensus on this. %$* 13
what do we do with studies that are done by serious economists who are respected, peer reviewed, who are telling us that they can't find evidence that your side of the motion is actually correct? %$* 13
i think-- %$* 586
and everybody needs to-- %$* 13
yeah, if you mind, maybe just pulling your seat right into the - - %$* 13
yeah. %$* 18
because just for the radio audience, if you're that far away, they end up hearing you like this-- %$* 13
yeah. %$* 18
and it doesn't come across in the room, but it's for real. %$* 13
nick hanauer. %$* 13
yeah, so just because the industrialized nations have not been radically unequal enough to allow economists to do timescale studies to prove that it will be harmful doesn't mean it's not. %$* 586
and, in fact, if you look around the world, there are 205 countries running simultaneous experiments on how to create prosperous societies. %$* 586
and in every single case where you find radical inequality you find low social economic mobility around the world, right? %$* 586
this is not-- %$* 586
this is not a far-out concept. %$* 586
there is very low economic mobility in highly unequal places in every place that you look. %$* 586
and so, you know, the truth is that the united states has only been a highly unequal society for 10 to 20 years. %$* 586
thirty years ago it was not that bad. %$* 586
and so, the fact that you don't-- %$* 586
we haven't had the time to measure it doesn't tell you anything. %$* 586
your common sense, on the other hand, should inform you highly. %$* 586
ed conard. %$* 13
yeah, nick is doing something that a lot of mobility scholars on the left try to do. %$* 587
they want to mix the results from high wage economies with low wage economies. %$* 587
and everybody serious in this field separates those apart. %$* 587
you have to look at them separately. %$* 587
and when you look at high wage economies, you simply don't find what nick's saying. %$* 587
the second thing i'd ask is, "well, when we think about going into the future-- %$* 587
" we do know this about the future, if we look backwards at the past, things have gotten more prosperous over time. %$* 587
the amount of money that we transfer in this economy has grown from about 11 percent to about 14 percent today. %$* 587
you used the term-- %$* 13
explain the term, "transfer"-- %$* 13
it's money that we take from one group of people in the economy and give to the other. %$* 587
through what devices? %$* 13
through taxation, government intervention. %$* 587
okay. %$* 13
a lot of that goes to the elderly. %$* 587
but the cbos look very carefully at the income that goes to the nonelderly families in the bottom 20 percent. %$* 587
in 2006 when they did the study, it was $15,000.it doesn't include state transfers, which brings it up to closer to 20.it's grown with inflation since then. %$* 587
today it is very close to about $25,000.now, nick, you've said it's $8,000.you look at another cbo study, it simply looks at the means tested piece of it, but there's many more pieces than the means tested piece, and there are other cbo studies that have looked very carefully at this. %$* 587
so, we do know this in the future, the amount of transfer that we are giving to people at the bottom of the income distribution is growing faster than the economy, is increasing over the time. %$* 587
it has gotten significant in size. %$* 587
we are doing a lot to try to help people at the bottom of the scale, and to increase their mobility. %$* 587
and as we go forward into the future, we're going to be doing even more and more. %$* 587
and what is driving that? %$* 587
the success of our economy is making that available. %$* 587
and there are studies – dollar and kraay for example. %$* 587
they look at the bottom 20 percent across many different economies. %$* 587
what do they find? %$* 587
the bottom 20 percent is highly correlated-- %$* 587
okay. %$* 13
to median wage. %$* 587
let's-- %$* 13
the more it grows, the better the poor are. %$* 587
elise gould, let's have you respond. %$* 13
i mean, what we've seen if we look-- %$* 585
as you said-- %$* 585
we should look at other advanced economies. %$* 585
and i-- %$* 585
and as i said in my opening remarks, we have lower mobility than denmark, norway, finland, sweden, japan, spain, france-- %$* 585
a number of countries that are advanced economies. %$* 585
and you brought up some research about miles corak. %$* 585
and we're not going to debate miles corak this or miles corak that. %$* 585
but the paper that i cited earlier, that family background is twice as important in determining children's success in the u.s.as in canada is also from a miles corak paper from this year. %$* 585
and he finds pronounced stickiness, particularly at the top and the bottom of the distribution, meaning that kids from high income families are far more likely to be high income. %$* 585
kids from low income families are far more likely to be low income. %$* 585
less stickiness, so much in the middle. %$* 585
and i want to respond to one other thing that ed said about transfers in resources. %$* 585
one thing you said in your opening comments-- %$* 585
you mentioned helping the working poor. %$* 585
the idea that we have working poor in this country is-- %$* 585
i just-- %$* 585
i think it just leaves such a bad taste in my mouth, that we have people that are hardworking, working full-time-- %$* 585
maybe full-year-- %$* 585
and they can't lift their families out of poverty. %$* 585
we absolutely need to think about-- %$* 585
let me stop-- %$* 13
let me stop you-- %$* 13
yeah. %$* 585
and just-- %$* 13
and go to ed, because the question was directed at you. %$* 13
and the last thing that elise said goes to the point of our motion-- %$* 13
that they can't lift themselves out of poverty. %$* 13
but that would be the question of mobility. %$* 13
she paints a very compelling, again, intuitive picture of that. %$* 13
what's your response to that? %$* 13
well, i think there are many people who have a difficult time lifting themselves out of poverty. %$* 587
if you're sick, you're going to have a difficult time. %$* 587
if you have mental illness, drug addiction, many different things-- %$* 587
if you were convicted of a crime and you're an ex-convict, it's going to be difficult for you to lift yourself out of poverty. %$* 587
but there are many, many, many people who can lift themselves out of poverty. %$* 587
tens of millions of hispanic immigrants have come across the border. %$* 587
they were making $2, $3 an hour. %$* 587
they're making $7 to $15 today. %$* 587
many of them-- %$* 587
many more than that. %$* 587
and they have-- %$* 587
okay. %$* 13
lifted themselves out of poverty. %$* 587
but i would like-- %$* 587
no. %$* 13
actually, i want to go back to-- %$* 13
i just wanted to have you-- %$* 13
an interruption to that point. %$* 13
and i want-- %$* 13
i will come back to you. %$* 13
elise, i just want to come back to you with that question. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
conceding that some people can't lift themselves out of poverty, what does that have to do with people being very rich at the top? %$* 13
well let’s just say the pie hasn't gotten bigger. %$* 585
it hasn't gotten smaller from rising-- %$* 585
it's gotten much bigger. %$* 18
income inequality. %$* 585
let's say the pie stays the same size. %$* 585
and if we know that a larger share of the pie is going to the top, that means that there's less there for everybody else. %$* 585
when there's less there for everybody else, there's fewer resources going particularly to the bottom-- %$* 585
is what we're going to talk about here-- %$* 585
particularly at the bottom, there's fewer resources. %$* 585
and parents cannot afford to make those investments. %$* 585
children are living in far more stressful home environments. %$* 585
unemployment is more common. %$* 585
there's less stable housing. %$* 585
and all of those things provide a situation where children just do not have the same opportunities-- %$* 585
okay. %$* 13
scott winship, in your opening statement, i think i heard you also agree with your opponents. %$* 13
while you were arguing against this motion, you agreed with them that there is a threat to opportunity. %$* 13
did i heard you correctly in that? %$* 13
you heard me correctly that i do agree that we have upward mobility that is too limited in the united states. %$* 588
so, the figures that i like to cite, if you are born in the bottom fifth, raised in the bottom fifth, you only have about a 30 to 40 percent chance of making it, either to the middle class or better than that. %$* 588
that's far too low in my book. %$* 588
but it's-- %$* 588
it's a leap to say that the reason for that limited upward mobility is because of income inequality or because income inequality has risen. %$* 588
and i think that's the fundamental question today. %$* 588
i'm as concerned as anybody about how do we increase upward mobility rates. %$* 588
but i just think-- %$* 588
if you're talking about bang for your buck, focusing on-- %$* 588
on bringing the incomes at the top down, it's just not going to buy you much. %$* 588
okay. %$* 13
so, you're saying the problems are real, but the cause is not the fact that people like nick hanauer are making a lot of money. %$* 13
nick hanauer. %$* 13
you think it is? %$* 13
yeah. %$* 586
i-- %$* 586
no. %$* 586
no. %$* 586
i mean-- %$* 586
look, i mean, you misunderstand our point. %$* 586
i do not, for a moment, believe that the problem with the economy is that we have too much success and we should hinder it in some way. %$* 586
i simply believe that it seems obvious that the most successful should pay into the pot enough so that we can generate the increasing-- %$* 586
the virtual cycle of increasing returns if capitalism can be. %$* 586
and there are a variety of things we have to do to close the inequality gap and to create more opportunity for people. %$* 586
it's certainly not discouraging success. %$* 586
but raising tax rates for private equity investors from the abomination of 15 percent to 39 does not discourage success. %$* 586
it simply allows-- %$* 586
it creates enough money to begin to help people who are struggling in their daily lives to actually have opportunity, to have a decent education, to have a decent place to live, to put food on the table, to lead a somewhat normal life. %$* 586
you know, so these two things-- %$* 586
these are not-- %$* 586
we are not claiming that we need to eliminate success. %$* 586
we need more success. %$* 586
but the economy grows, the more successful people become. %$* 586
it's not driven by a couple of people at the top like me and ed. %$* 586
it's driven by everyone else out there. %$* 586
and that's the point-- %$* 586
that's the economy. %$* 586
it's the dynamic interaction of buyers and sellers, not the bank accounts of the rich. %$* 586
ed conard. %$* 13
what's the question? %$* 587
oh, i thought you were-- %$* 13
you were like all riled up to respond to that. %$* 13
no, no since gone. %$* 587
yeah? %$* 13
you're done? %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
i mean, i'll-- %$* 587
i'll respond to some of these comments if you like. %$* 587
i think-- %$* 587
no, i thought you were raring to, but-- %$* 13
well, i'll go back to one point, which is take, for example, test prep that we've talked about and how much parents are preparing. %$* 587
there are two kinds of colleges. %$* 587
there's prestigious colleges which have a limited number of slots, and then there's other colleges which basically have an unlimited number of slots. %$* 587
what's happened is that in the prestigious-- %$* 587
in the prestigious colleges, we have allocated more and more slots to lower income students and to minority students. %$* 587
and as a result, what you find is that rich white students are working harder and harder for a limited number of slots in the most prestigious schools. %$* 587
and so it's disingenuous to say that test prep is reducing mobility at a time when we're increasing the number of slots and trying to increase mobility. %$* 587
at the same time, at the low-- %$* 587
at the less prestigious schools, anybody who's capable of going, who takes the test and is able to get through the school, can go to those schools. %$* 587
there is no shortage of slots. %$* 587
we've increased the number of slots. %$* 587
we've increased the number of students participating in that. %$* 587
so, it would be unfair, for example, to say, "gee, there's more and more rich students going to those schools than there are poor schools-- %$* 587
poor students today." any student who can get there can get there. %$* 587
and we have spent more and more money trying to help people get as far as they can in life. %$* 587
and we've tried to help those people at the bottom who are not able to pull themselves out of poverty. %$* 587
it's not as though we're letting those people starve to death. %$* 587
we are giving them a substantial amount of money to try to help them maintain some standard of living at that level. %$* 587
so, i think it's just difficult to make the argument that mobility is declining over time. %$* 587
we're doing everything we can to increase it. %$* 587
okay. %$* 13
elise gould, do you want to respond to that? %$* 13
conceding-- %$* 13
i mean, giving that you're conceding that studies don't show that mobility is declining over time, but take on the point about education because you're talk-- %$* 13
you're sort of saying, let's look at the future, and let's look at-- %$* 13
let's look at the mechanisms in place and the trend and what seems inevitable and intuitive. %$* 13
yes. %$* 585
thank you. %$* 585
wait. %$* 13
i'm not supposed to be doing-- %$* 13
putting words in your mouth like that so-- %$* 13
no, no, i'm going to-- %$* 585
okay. %$* 13
talk about what i'm planning on talking about today. %$* 585
very good. %$* 13
you didn't feed me anything. %$* 585
i'm not so sure about there being infinite slots in all the other schools, but that's another question. %$* 585
and test prep is really far more available to the higher income, so that's not really where i want to go either. %$* 585
i think the direction i want to go is inequality at the starting gate. %$* 585
and from that, i mean inequality at the beginning of kindergarten. %$* 585
these differences are found very early on. %$* 585
the differences in resources available to higher income children is far greater than available to lower income children. %$* 585
as i said before, higher rates of unemployment, instability, lower income, all of those things absolutely come at a cost to kids. %$* 585
and you see vast disparities, even the first day of kindergarten. %$* 585
and schools do their best to try to maintain-- %$* 585
but let me-- %$* 13
let me just stop you for a second because i'm just looking at the motion on the screen behind you. %$* 13
and you're saying that poverty causes these problems, and i think your opponents agree with that. %$* 13
but they're disagreeing-- %$* 13
yep. %$* 585
with you that the fact that there's an-- %$* 13
that there is some very, very-- %$* 13
there's a top 1 percent that's way, way up at the ladder is at the root of these problems. %$* 13
if-- %$* 585
so, that makes it impossible for-- %$* 13
that that's the fact that-- %$* 13
that's who the motion is, that that inequality makes it impossible for people to move out of that situation. %$* 13
right. %$* 585
i would argue that the growth in inequality has led to more poverty in this country as opposed to what the counter factual would be. %$* 585
so if we had had, let's say from the late '50s to the mid '70s, we had economic growth that was associated with falling poverty rates. %$* 585
if that relationship had continued, if, as the economy grew, we had broadly shared prosperity across the entire distribution, then we would have basically eradicated poverty by the 1980s. %$* 585
so, this is absolutely a discussion about the size of the pie, not just the size of the pie, but the distribution of those resources of the pie. %$* 585
and it's not just about the bottom. %$* 585
if we were to look at what happened to middle income families, and my research shows that if you were to look at sort of the wedge that's created by this growing inequality, that the typical family today would be making 18,000 more dollars in just one year. %$* 585
those are substantial resources that american families could put a lot more energy into investments in their children. %$* 585
okay. %$* 13
so take it to you, scott winship. %$* 13
what i think i hear elise saying is, it's not-- %$* 13
the relevant issue is not that there are a lot of people that are very rich, it's that there are a lot of people that are very poor, that that level of inequality, those depths are very, very difficult to move out of and therefore there is immobility at that-- %$* 13
at that level. %$* 13
well, i think poverty is too high in america. %$* 588
but it's lower than-- %$* 588
quite a bit lower than it was in the 196-- %$* 588
but how escapable is it? %$* 13
i'm sorry? %$* 588
how escapable is it? %$* 13
it's probably-- %$* 588
you know, i am fortunate enough not to have grown up poor, i'm guessing it's still very difficult to escape. %$* 588
i mean, the bottom line is if you-- %$* 588
if you start in the bottom, you have something like a 40 to 50 percent chance that you're going to stay in the bottom as an adult. %$* 588
but the question on the table, i think, is whether income inequality is behind that. %$* 588
and i think the evidence just isn't there. %$* 588
so one reason i think that you might worry about rising inequality is if the attainments of the poor were actually getting worse. %$* 588
but that's generally not what you find. %$* 588
test scores have risen among the poor. %$* 588
college graduation has risen among the poor. %$* 588
the problem is that in a lot of cases it's risen faster at the top. %$* 588
but it's a very different situation than i think the depiction that as income inequality has risen, it's sort of been just this-- %$* 588
this brutal shift for people at the bottom. %$* 588
i think it's always been tough to be poor, but i don't think it's tougher today because the top 1 percent share has gone from a very high 10 percent to an even higher 24 percent. %$* 588
nick hanauer, you-- %$* 13
you've heard your opponents say, to some degree, that the pie is bigger because of the people who are successful at the top. %$* 13
and in your opening remarks, you made the argument that that just doesn't make sense. %$* 13
but can you elaborate a little bit now that they've made more of a point, that their hard work, ingenuity, investment, risk taking actually causes-- %$* 13
you know, actually grows the pie overall. %$* 13
we're in violent agreement about that our economy benefits massively from very clever and very hard working people taking risks and innovating. %$* 586
that's not the question. %$* 586
the question is, should only a few percent of us be able to do that. %$* 586
and the answer to that is categorically no. %$* 586
i mean, look, here's the way to connect these two things. %$* 586
why are the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer? %$* 586
well, here's a reason, because over the last 40 years, the percent of profits that american corporations generate as a percentage of gdp, has gone from 6 to 12 percent. %$* 586
at the same time, the percent of gdp devoted to labor has gone from 52 to 42.so that difference is about a trillion dollars annually. %$* 586
so that-- %$* 586
here's the thing you have to understand. %$* 586
that trillion dollars isn't profit because it needs to be or should be or has to be. %$* 586
it's profit because powerful people like me and ed prefer it to be. %$* 586
that trillion dollars could very easily be spent on wages. %$* 586
or on discounts for consumers. %$* 586
this isn't a consequence of some magical law of economics. %$* 586
this is a consequence of differentials in power. %$* 586
and the thing is-- %$* 586
the thing is, is that if that trillion dollars was, instead of stuck in my bank account and ed's bank account, but instead was coursing through the economy as wages and opportunity, we'd have more innovators, we'd have more risk-takers. %$* 586
that's the beautiful thing about capitalism. %$* 586
if you set it up right, it works super well. %$* 586
all right. %$* 13
ed conard. %$* 13
i do think there's a popular argument which is, "investment waits for demand, and if we don't get the customer demand, we won't get the investment." but it isn't true. %$* 587
investment doesn't wait for demand. %$* 587
apple will create an iphone, and samsung will come up with a competition, and microsoft will scramble to fix their problem. %$* 587
there's a lot of turn of the economy-- %$* 587
and there's a lot of investment in the economy. %$* 587
and the people who are generating that investment-- %$* 587
the money that nick's saving which is funding those investments causes a lot of other consumption in our economy and puts a lot of other people to work. %$* 587
and so what these guys have done, because their argument isn't stronger, they retreat to a mathematical truth, which is this, "if the pie stays the same and we split it up different, people would have $18,000 more money."germany, france, japan, they've all tried it, they all distribute income more equally, and they are not able to achieve the median incomes that we achieve in the united states. %$* 587
and why is that? %$* 587
because there's another economic truth that they don't want to admit to which is you have to get a customer to pay somebody $18,000 more a year to buy the product to pay them that. %$* 587
and if you can't do that, all the mathematical splitting of the world won't solve your problem. %$* 587
all right. %$* 13
i want to go to some questions and answers now from the audience. %$* 13
and the way this will work, if you raise your hand, i'll call upon you. %$* 13
and the microphone will be brought down to you. %$* 13
the same thing, hold the mike close to your mouth so that the podcast and livestream the radio can hear you. %$* 13
and tell us your name, and then come out with the question. %$* 13
ma'am, right here, if you can stand up, too, thanks. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 19
oh, no, i'm sorry, i gave the high sign to your neighbor. %$* 13
oh. %$* 19
i'm sorry. %$* 13
awkward. %$* 13
hi, good evening. %$* 19
i'm a teacher. %$* 19
can you-- %$* 13
a little bit closer. %$* 13
i'm a teacher. %$* 19
so, i just want to set a premise and then address something that was said in the-- %$* 19
with a question. %$* 19
these days the lower income children can't-- %$* 19
ma'am, i can't let you make a speech. %$* 13
okay. %$* 19
please go to the question. %$* 13
all right. %$* 19
so the question is if the children from lower income families can't afford the investment in the programs that are necessary in order to achieve the grades necessary to go to college, it's not an issue of the money getting into the school, because, yes, they're giving it away, but if they can't-- %$* 19
ma'am, i need you to get to a question. %$* 13
the question is how can they compete to get into these schools if they don't have the knowledge necessary because they can't buy it the way that the wealthier families can? %$* 19
i'm going to pass on your-- %$* 13
i think it's a fair question-- %$* 13
i'm going to pass on it, because i want to have questions that go to the nature of this motion, which is the impact of the wide-- %$* 13
the height of the ladder and its impact on upward mobility. %$* 13
and i do think we addressed to some degree the education question in remarks made by elise gould, but thanks very much. %$* 13
sir. %$* 13
and i say that with respect. %$* 13
yes. %$* 19
thank you. %$* 13
all right, you're you won, okay. %$* 13
okay. %$* 19
i would just like to ask the gentleman on the right how they can compare income mobility in the united states with income mobility in europe? %$* 19
very, very briefly, my daughter and son-in-law-- %$* 19
you know what? %$* 13
i'm-- %$* 13
no, okay. %$* 19
okay. %$* 19
you had a question mark after the seventh word, and we're getting-- %$* 13
the reason for my question-- %$* 19
no, i do have-- %$* 19
no, no, i'm sorry, ma'am, i can't let you, because we just don't have time. %$* 13
but how about that question? %$* 13
how can you compare rates in the united states with rates in europe meaningfully? %$* 13
sure, well-- %$* 588
scott winship. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
you know, i think the real key is that you look at the positions where kids start out and the positions where they end up. %$* 588
and that's why for so long the conventional wisdom was, as elise said, that the u.s.had such worse mobility than other countries because it didn't actually look at that if it was a measure that showed worse mobility when inequality rose mechanically. %$* 588
and so that was the innovation of miles corak's newest paper, where he looks at ranks of parents, ranks of kids. %$* 588
the other paper that you cited by him was older. %$* 588
i actually commissioned it while i was at pew. %$* 588
elise, do you want to respond to that or we can move on if you want to. %$* 13
we'll move on? %$* 13
okay, and then i'm going to come to this side. %$* 13
sir, yes, %$* 13
hi, my name's hans i'm just going to add chickens and eggs into ladders and pies. %$* 18
can you tell me why wages versus employment-- %$* 18
is it the chicken and egg argument, 40 years ago, why people would have chosen for higher rates of employment versus higher wages? %$* 18
why isn't it just one before the other? %$* 18
edward conard. %$* 13
and ed, if you can move in, too. %$* 13
i'm not sure i understand what you mean by chosen. %$* 587
i think what ends up happening is if you have a restricted supply of labor and you get growth, you'll get higher wages. %$* 587
and if you have an unrestricted supply of labor, you'll get higher employment. %$* 587
it's-- %$* 587
and you'll get a little bit of both. %$* 587
where you end, i mean, i suppose it's newton's third law of momentum, how much of it ends up in employment and how much of it ends up in wages? %$* 587
but some of that has to do with real natural restrictions in the physical world. %$* 587
i you don't have the employees, then you're going to get the wage growth as there's more and more demand for that labor. %$* 587
if you have an unrestricted supply, you're going to get faster employment growth. %$* 587
we got two-- %$* 587
three times faster employment growth than japan, twice as fast the employment growth of germany and france, the two big economies in europe. %$* 587
we have even faster growth from most of the other economies in europe. %$* 587
we can find norway or something like that, with oil, which can be slightly different, but it's not that much different. %$* 587
elise gould. %$* 13
to answer your question, i think that ed is maybe oversimplifying a little bit. %$* 585
we have seen employment growth and we haven't seen wage growth. %$* 585
but we have a period in recent history-- %$* 585
in the late '90s-- %$* 585
when we saw strong wage growth. %$* 585
we saw a tighter economy. %$* 585
we saw higher employment. %$* 585
we saw, arguably, full employment. %$* 585
and that meant that wages across the entire wage distribution actually rose. %$* 585
and we saw that everywhere, and we actually saw stronger growth at the bottom than anywhere else. %$* 585
and so, i think you can see higher employment. %$* 585
you can also see higher wages. %$* 585
it's not-- %$* 585
it's not-- %$* 585
i don't want to oversimplify that. %$* 585
yeah. %$* 586
i would just like to add-- %$* 586
yeah. %$* 13
that, you know, the fundamental of capitalism is when workers have more money, businesses have more customers, and need more workers. %$* 586
that's what-- %$* 586
why the role of policy is to solve the collective action system-- %$* 586
a collective action problem and push wages up for all workers, because when you do, it's good for business and for workers. %$* 586
scott winship. %$* 13
just to address-- %$* 588
i want to agree with elise, again, that the 1950s and 60s were this amazing period for the poor. %$* 588
and the middle class incomes grew more than they did at the top. %$* 588
but again, i think-- %$* 588
it's a leap to argue that the reason we have that-- %$* 588
that period was because inequality was low. %$* 588
the slowdown in incomes at the bottom and in the middle class started in the 1970s, a full decade before income concentration began rising at the top. %$* 588
let's go to another question. %$* 13
right down front here. %$* 13
hi, i'm mike. %$* 18
i was expecting to hear the against side arguing a lacking relationship between the two, between inequality and upward mobility. %$* 18
instead, i kind of heard you guys suggesting that inequality can drive upward mobility. %$* 18
so, i'm wondering if you would advocate active and systemic mechanisms to do just that, to increase inequality as a tough love mechanism – to help the poor. %$* 18
that's about the best question we've had in about a year. %$* 13
edward conard. %$* 13
i think that customers decide how much people get paid, how much they're willing to pay for products and for employees and such. %$* 587
and so, anything that gets in the way slows growth. %$* 587
it doesn't increase growth. %$* 587
and so, no. %$* 587
i would be against any policy that tried to artificially do what customers don't want. %$* 587
what customers want will improve the success of our-- %$* 587
of our economy. %$* 587
i would also remind elise that in the 1990s, we commercialized the internet and e-mail. %$* 587
it was like the telephone. %$* 587
we had enormous growth in the 1990s as a result, faster than the supply of labor, and it drove up the wages. %$* 587
if we can find another one of those, we'll have great-- %$* 587
we'll have great growth. %$* 587
elise gould. %$* 13
i don't think customers decide. %$* 585
i think we're-- %$* 585
you know, we're talking about how we're splitting, how much of the profits come in, and we've seen record-high profits-- %$* 585
i don't think customers decided that ceo to the average worker pay should go from 30 to one 30 years ago to almost 300 to one today. %$* 585
another question? %$* 13
ma'am, right in the middle there. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 19
good evening. %$* 19
i'm lilly. %$* 19
i'm a senior in high school, so i get what you're saying about all the not %$* 19
sorry for the ma’am. %$* 13
my questions to both cons and the pro sides-- %$* 19
pro side-- %$* 19
i need you to pick one. %$* 13
just one? %$* 19
yes. %$* 13
everybody gets one question, and it's 30 seconds long, and we're 18 seconds in already. %$* 13
okay. %$* 19
do you have any ideas or solutions to either increase the upward mobility or just to-- %$* 19
i'm going to pass again because we're not debating what the solutions are. %$* 13
fair question, and we may do a debate on it at some point. %$* 13
sir, in the corner there. %$* 13
my name is ben. %$* 18
for the for side, i would assume that the argument is not that if we lock nick and ed up that mobility would increase and that instead it involves transfers of wealth to others. %$* 18
and my question, if that is part of your solution, is transferring income from one group to others really consistent with your definition of the american dream of upward mobility. %$* 18
oh, that's a great-- %$* 585
nick hanauer. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 586
so-- %$* 586
so transfers are a very small part of the solution here. %$* 586
requiring businesses to pay workers a living wage is not a transfer. %$* 586
that's solving a collective action problem. %$* 586
requiring businesses to pay middle class employees overtime is not a transfer. %$* 586
it's a fairness and collective action problem. %$* 586
and there are all sorts of ways that everyone benefits when every business pays its workers more, including every business, right? %$* 586
because when every business pays its workers a decent wage, every business has more customers and every taxpayer is spared the expense of sending their tax dollars to the government to pay for the food stamps that low-wage workers require. %$* 586
so it has less to do with transfers than other things. %$* 586
okay. %$* 13
i want to remind you that we are in the question-and-answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13

no. %$* 140
values are a core interest because we're a democracy and the american people demand that our leadership respect our values. %$* 140
we can-- %$* 140
but your opponent is saying we haven't shown that we really believe in that. %$* 13
yeah, well, the fact that there's no human being that is the perfect representative of his or her values. %$* 140
but it doesn't mean that they don't have them and don't aspire to apply them. %$* 140
bret? %$* 13
i was just going to say, we're a country that in a sense is unique in that we often find ourselves defining our interests by our values rather than the other way around. %$* 141
and by the way, a reputation for being a humane hegemon is good for us in the long run. %$* 141
it allows us to maintain a pox americana in the way that the russians were not able to maintain a soviet peace in their sphere of influence because, at some level, countries around the world understand that we operate differently from the iranians, the chinese, and the russians. %$* 141
and it what makes countries want to be our allies, our friends, our trading partners. %$* 141
so yes, we do have an interest in making sure when we can tip the scales at relatively low cost to ourselves, that we shouldn't allow atrocities to happen. %$* 141
that's not the kind of country we were born to be. %$* 141
and i think this is a common-sense proposition all of you would agree with. %$* 141
in the back there, wearing a necktie. %$* 13
yes, sir. %$* 13
if you just put your hand up. %$* 13
if you can stand up. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
hi. %$* 18
i have a question for the far side-- %$* 18
could you tell us your name, please? %$* 13
hi, my name is carl shashi to think about the impact on where whether it stops any good process and whether it generates any bad process in the future. %$* 18
and you argument to say it doesn't actually stop any good process, the military intervention. %$* 18
could you talk a little bit about what your thoughts are about what are the bad process that the military intervention would generate that you don't think it would. %$* 18
wait, so you're saying what are the bad consequences of inaction? %$* 13
no, i think i got him. %$* 140
he was saying what are some of the bad things that our action could generate. %$* 140
is that what you're saying? %$* 140
yeah. %$* 18
but why would you want this side to believe that this side would want to give you all that ammunition? %$* 13
i can answer that. %$* 140
okay. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
go ahead. %$* 13
i can answer it. %$* 140
and i hopefully will not shoot myself in the foot in doing so. %$* 140
look, the problem that you have is that-- %$* 140
is that we can never know the future. %$* 140
so it's always a question of, do the risks of inaction-- %$* 140
or are the risks of inaction worse than the risks of action? %$* 140
that's what it-- %$* 140
that's what it comes down to. %$* 140
and so that's why i argued that we should have a bias toward action because lack of action destroys our alliances. %$* 140
and if we desire to keep this region at a distance, then we have to persuade other actors on the ground to take action in order so that we don't have to go in unilaterally. %$* 140
the paul pillar thesis here is that if we-- %$* 140
if we are always showing restraint in keeping the region at a distance, then we won't have to use unilateral action. %$* 140
and i'm saying, no, it's actually the opposite. %$* 140
the more we don't flex our-- %$* 140
the more we don't flex our muscles, the more likely we make it that we're going to have to go in alone and massively because we won't have any allies. %$* 140
let's let paul pillar respond. %$* 13
you know, mike now has twice used phraseology that i think john shows some of the differences we have despite all that wonderful agreement we had earlier. %$* 139
and he mispronounced your name. %$* 13
oh, that's right. %$* 18
well, i didn't-- %$* 18
i didn't-- %$* 18
i didn't hit him on that, but-- %$* 139
okay. %$* 13
a bias-- %$* 139
you know, i don't think our foreign policy ought to be biased one way or the other toward action or toward inaction. %$* 139
it ought to be an unbiased way of cost and benefits and weighing of those core interests that we were talking about a moment ago – and not come at it with a preconception that we ought to be acting more than or the other way around. %$* 139
there's a system-- %$* 140
there's a system out there that has its own logic. %$* 140
mike, let me just do one bit of radio, and i'll come to you in a few seconds. %$* 13
and can i-- %$* 18
wait, wait. %$* 13
and i need no laughter. %$* 13
i want to remind you that we're in the question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan, your moderator. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, debating this motion: flexing america's muscles in the middle east will make things worse. %$* 13
the team arguing against the motion. %$* 13
bret stephens. %$* 13
very briefly, it was our bias toward inaction-- %$* 141
and by the way, i'm using "bias" in an unbiased sense. %$* 141
i presume you're all grammatically and tactically literal. %$* 141
it was our bias toward inaction that has made the syrian problem, which began has a peaceful uprising against a brutal regime, turn into a quagmire that is in fact very different-- %$* 141
difficult to figure out. %$* 141
it is our bias toward inaction which has allowed the crisis in iran, the nuclear crisis in iran, to that lady's question there, to go from being a potentially manageable problem to being a particularly difficult problem, not the least-- %$* 141
not least because if iran either acquires a nuclear program-- %$* 141
a nuclear weapon or is seen as being in a kind of a zone of ambiguity, we will soon be faced with a middle east in which saudi arabia has a nuclear weapon, perhaps the algerians get a nuclear weapon, perhaps the egyptians get a nuclear weapon, or the turks, all of them countries capable of getting them. %$* 141
and then our problems will be that much more serious because we won't be looking at a kind of symmetrical standoff. %$* 141
we will be looking at these kind of overlapping, multiple asymmetries. %$* 141
are the turks enemies of israel? %$* 141
are they enemies of iran? %$* 141
are the saudis enemies of-- %$* 141
bret, let me-- %$* 13
let me cut in because of time. %$* 13
i want to let mike doran say something, and then we'll give the last word to this panel. %$* 13
mike doran. %$* 13
the-- %$* 140
we have two problems in the middle east: malevolent actors that want to do us harm like al-qaeda and the iranians and our friends. %$* 140
our friends all-- %$* 140
there's a big frenemy problem in the middle east that we're all familiar with. %$* 140
and the problem is, if we sit back and do nothing, it doesn't mean that our friends do nothing either. %$* 140
they go, and they do things to look after their interests, and they use tools and follow policies that are dangerous for us. %$* 140
so, if we want to vector them, we have to take action. %$* 140
last word from the side arguing for the motion, paul pillar. %$* 13
bret's mentioned several times this iranian nuclear thing. %$* 139
i wish we had more time to talk about that, but that's one thing where the u.s.administration, the current one, has taken a lot of action. %$* 139
they seize the opportunity to have the negotiations that have taken place over the last year, which gives us the best chance to deal with exactly the sorts of threats if you're worried about them, that bret described. %$* 139
military force, flexing that muscle, isn't going to do any good, because besides not destroying the capability of iran to build a nuclear weapon, if they really wanted to, it gives the best possible incentive to construct a nuclear deterrent. %$* 139
and that concludes round two of this intelligence squared u.s. debate. %$* 13
where our motion is "flexing america's muscles in the middle east will make things worse." and here is where we are. %$* 13
we are about to hear brief closing remarks from each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be two minutes each. %$* 13
and remember how you voted beforehand. %$* 13
this is their last chance for them to change your minds. %$* 13
you'll be asked to vote again right after these closing remarks which will be in just a few minutes from now. %$* 13
on to round three, closing statements. %$* 13
first summarizing his position in support of the motion "flexing america's muscles in the middle east will make things worse," paul pillar, a senior fellow at the center for security studies at georgetown and former national security officer. %$* 13
well, first i want to thank bret and mike for their very spirited contributions to this debate and, john, for your very even-handed moderation, and most of all to my colleague aaron. %$* 139
you know, we americans have an awful lot of faith in our ability to do great things overseas. %$* 139
it is a well founded faith, because we have done some great things, including with the use of military force, like bret mentioned earlier in his opening remarks. %$* 139
world war ii is probably the best example of all. %$* 139
but some things, even we the superpower can't do, even with our military might. %$* 139
i've served in the u.s.military and in a foreign conflict. %$* 139
and in my case, it was as an army officer in the vietnam war. %$* 139
that war was an extremely painful lesson to us, the american people, about the limitations of what we can do with military force. %$* 139
and among the bad consequences it had was getting to the issue of credibility, it reduced the credibility that the u.s.would use that military instrument in other better ways because of the american people's reaction to what had happened. %$* 139
enough years went by, and we finally got over what happened and what we called the vietnam syndrome. %$* 139
in one way, we demonstrated we got over it was another thing that bret mentioned, the splendid victory in the middle east reversing saddam hussein's aggression against kuwait in 1991. %$* 139
but the problem is, since then, we've been thinking more and doing more of using military force not just to reverse someone else's aggression like in world war ii or operation enduring freedom or desert storm. %$* 139
we got into other things, changing regimes we didn't like or taking part in someone else's civil war, or trying to inject democracy through the barrel of a gun. %$* 139
leadership is not just flexing muscle. %$* 139
it is having the wisdom to know the limitations and the costs and the risks, and most of all to follow the hippocratic principle of "first do no harm." %$* 139
thank you, paul pillar. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 139
the motion is flexing america's muscles in the middle east will make things worse. %$* 13
and here to summarize his position against this motion, bret stephens, a foreign affairs columnist and member of the editorial board at the wall street journal. %$* 13
well, thank you, and thanks particularly to aaron and paul for this wonderful debate and to the entire audience. %$* 141
what about me? %$* 140
mike, i'll get to you in a second. %$* 141
for the last few years, the united states has conducted precisely the kind of diplomacy and geopolitical strategy that paul pillar has spent this evening advocating. %$* 141
we have focused on nation building at home. %$* 141
we have had a president who has told us time and again that the tide of war is receding. %$* 141
we've had a president whose bias, generally speaking, has been toward inaction, not action. %$* 141
we've had an administration that believes that the best course for the united states is to reduce its footprint, particularly in the middle east, to pivot away from that region, to look at asia, to look at our own problems at home, with the idea that in so doing that region would perhaps sort out its own problems and affect us less. %$* 141
and yet the reality is exactly the opposite of what we have seen. %$* 141
a rand corporation study showed that the number of jihadists in the middle east, of jihadi groups and fighters more than doubled between 2010 and 2014, precisely during the time that the obama administration was saying "the tide of war is receding," and precisely during the time that we were essentially following the counsel of our opponents on the other side of the stage. %$* 141
we have not made the world go away. %$* 141
we have not made the world a safer place. %$* 141
the world is more dangerous today than it was a few years ago. %$* 141
the world is a scarier place not just in the middle east, but russia and china. %$* 141
machiavelli once said "the best policy is to be a firm friend and a thorough foe." for the last few years, we have been neither. %$* 141
we have to change that, or we will imperil our security here in new york. %$* 141
well, thank you, and thanks particularly to aaron and paul for this wonderful debate and to the entire audience. %$* 141
thank you, bret stephens. %$* 13
and the motion is, flexing america's muscles in the middle east will make things worse. %$* 13
here to summarize his position in support of the motion, aaron david miller, vice president for new initiatives at the wilson center and former u.s. middle east negotiator. %$* 13
thanks, john. %$* 138
and, paul, thank you for articulate, compelling and a gallant defense. %$* 138
and, mike and bret, it's-- %$* 138
i appear with you guys all the time. %$* 138
we have to do this again. %$* 138
two days before the camp david summit, president clinton, during a briefing, remarked to us-- %$* 138
he knew the odds were long-- %$* 138
that trying and failing was better than not having tried at all. %$* 138
and i remember how inspired i was by his remarks. %$* 138
the more i thought about it, the more i watched this angry broken dysfunctional region and republicans and democrats alike, equally trying to navigate a course between too much and too little, i began to understand that "trying and failing is better than not trying at all," is an appropriate slogan for a high school college football team. %$* 138
it is not a substitute for foreign policy of the most consequential nation on earth. %$* 138
we need to think before we act, and we need to understand, above all, that the dividing line for a smart foreign policy is not between left and right, not between liberal and conservative, not between republicans and democrats, it's between smart on one hand and dumb on the other. %$* 138
and the only question that you have to decide, and i implore you to vote for this motion, because i think our arguments, paul's in particular, has struck the right balance between risk readiness on one hand, risk aversion on the other, a clear definition of when u.s.military power and its projection is important and vital and when it is not. %$* 138
three questions need to be asked, and if i'm too risk averse in this region the historical record of the last 20 years validates my risk aversion. %$* 138
three questions, number one, "what are we trying to achieve by deploying military force? %$* 138
" number two, "do we have the means at our disposal to accomplish our ends? %$* 138
" and, number, three, above all, "what will it cost? %$* 138
" you ask those questions, you're firm and resolute, and american interests can be protected. %$* 138
thank you, aaron david miller. %$* 13
our motion is "flexing america’s muscles in the middle east will make things worse." here to summarize his position against his motion, mike doran. %$* 13
he's a senior fellow at the brookings institution and former senior director at the national security council. %$* 13
thank you, john. %$* 140
paul, aaron, it really has been an honor and a pleasure, it's really been great, but, bret, working with you has been the highlight of the evening for me. %$* 140
paul would have us believe that we can stay back, sit back, away from the region, and not be involved in the sectarian fight on the ground. %$* 140
and it's simply not true. %$* 140
i once had a good friend who went on the peace corps to tuvalu, little pacific nation that most of us have-- %$* 140
probably haven't heard of. %$* 140
i had never heard of it until i met him. %$* 140
and i found out that the people of tuvalu were very angry with us because we had come up with some fishing regulations that destroyed their economy. %$* 140
of course, nobody in america even knew that we did this, right? %$* 140
it's the same thing in the middle east. %$* 140
we are judged by our action, and we are judged by our inaction. %$* 140
and we are participants by the nature of our size and our historic role in the middle east in the sectarian conflict, in all of the conflicts in the region, whether we think we are or not, whether we stay out or whether we don't. %$* 140
so, the question is not whether to intervene or not to intervene, it's how to shape what's going on there. %$* 140
and the most important resource that we have in order to keep us from having to have massive interventions like the kind that we had in iraq in 2003, is to build up our alliances. %$* 140
and the only way we can build up our alliances is by providing security to our friends. %$* 140
and right now our friends in the middle east don't believe that they can rely on us because, time and again over the last decade, we have backed away from commitments to them. %$* 140
and that's why we have to use military force so that we will not have the kind of wars that paul wants to prevent. %$* 140
thank you, mike doran. %$* 13
and that concludes our closing statements. %$* 13
and now it's time to learn which side has argued best. %$* 13
we're asking you again to go to the keypad at your seat that will register your vote. %$* 13
we will get the readout almost instantaneously. %$* 13
remember the motion is "flexing america’s muscles in the middle east will make things worse." if you agree with the motion, push number one. %$* 13
if you disagree, push number two. %$* 13
if you became or remain undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and you can ignore the other keys. %$* 13
they are not live. %$* 13
and we'll have the results in just about a minute and a half. %$* 13
and while we're waiting for that to happen, i, too, want to-- %$* 13
all the debaters got up here and congratulated each other and thanked one another for a great evening-- %$* 13
i think we actually did carve a pretty good debate out of this near agreement at the beginning. %$* 13
we found your fault lines. %$* 13
and more importantly, we found that they're sincere, passionate, and important. %$* 13
but you brought a spirit of decency and respect to this whole thing. %$* 13
i congratulate all of you for doing that. %$* 13
and i'd also like to thank everybody who got up and asked a question. %$* 13
i didn't have to throw anything out tonight. %$* 13
the questions were all good. %$* 13
so, thanks to everybody for getting up and doing that. %$* 13
again, as i said at the beginning, we would love it if you would tweet about the debate. %$* 13
our twitter handle is @iq2us. the hashtag for this debate is #mideastdebate. %$* 13
our next debate here at the kaufman center. %$* 13
it's wednesday, october 22nd. %$* 13
the motion is income inequality impairs the american dream of upward mobility. %$* 13
we have an economist and a one-percenter on each side of this debate. %$* 13
for the motion, we have elise gould. %$* 13
she's a senior economist at the economic policy institute. %$* 13
and she studies wages, poverty, inequality, and healthcare. %$* 13
her partner is nick hanauer, who is an entrepreneur and venture capitalist. %$* 13
his ted talk on the true job creators went viral back in 2010.against the motion, edward conard. %$* 13
he's a former partner at bain and author of “unintended consequence”-- %$* 13
oh, we should have had him here tonight-- %$* 13
“unintended consequences: why everything you've been told about the economy is wrong”.his partner is scott winship, a fellow at the manhattan institute who studies living standards and economic mobility. %$* 13
and in a week, october 7th, we're going to be in philadelphia at the national constitution center. %$* 13
the debate that night is mass collection of u.s.phone records violates the fourth amendment. %$* 13
tickets for all of our debates are available at our website, iq2us.org. %$* 13
and i wanted to let you know also that we have a new app that you can get through the apple store and the android google play store that lets you watch all of the debates that we've ever done, which is now 97 after tonight-- %$* 13
ish-- %$* 13
and what's upcoming. %$* 13
and you can comment. %$* 13
and it's free. %$* 13
and it's actually a lovely app. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
so, it's all in. %$* 13
i have the final results. %$* 13
the motion is this: flexing america's muscles in the middle east will make things worse. %$* 13
that was the motion. %$* 13
and before hearing the debate, our live audience here in new york voted this way: 26 percent agreed with the motion; 31 percent were against; 43 percent were undecided. %$* 13
that's a large figure for us. %$* 13
so, those were the first results. %$* 13
remember, now you have voted a second time, and the winner is the team whose numbers have changed the most in percentage point terms from the first vote to the second. %$* 13
so, let's go to the second vote. %$* 13
on the motion flexing america's muscles in the middle east will make things worse, the team arguing for the motion, their second vote was 45 percent. %$* 13
that's 26 percent to 45 percent. %$* 13
they picked up 19 percentage points. %$* 13
that is the number to beat. %$* 13
the team arguing against the motion, their second vote was 31 percent-- %$* 13
their first vote 31 percent; second vote, 45 percent. %$* 13
they pulled up 14 percentage points. %$* 13
it's not quite enough. %$* 13
the team arguing for the motion wins our debate. %$* 13
that is, flexing america's muscles in the middle east will make things worse. %$* 13
our congratulations to them. %$* 13
and thank you from me, john donvan, and intelligence squared. %$* 13
we'll see you next time. %$* 13

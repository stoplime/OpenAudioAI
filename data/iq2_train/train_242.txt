there would be no intelligence squared u.s.if not for the beneficence of our founder, the chairman of the rosenkranz foundation, mr. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
well, welcome to all of you. %$* 1
as the regulars in this series know, typically i use the first few minutes before each debate to outline the arguments on both sides. %$* 1
tonight i'm going to do something a little different and share with you the reasons we thought that framing a debate on entitlements in intergenerational terms could shed some new light on a familiar topic. %$* 1
american politics has focused endlessly, if inconclusively on health care, on the uninsured, on jobs, on entitlements and on the deficit. %$* 1
fault lines have been drawn between liberals and conservatives, between rich and poor. %$* 1
but the intergenerational aspects of these issues have barely figured in the debate. %$* 1
one shocking statistic is that 37 percent of those who came of age in this millennium are unemployed. %$* 1
when consumers lack the confidence to spend, when businessmen lack the confidence to invest and to higher, it is the young that suffer most. %$* 1
the health insurance debate focused on the uninsured. %$* 1
but think for a moment about how health insurance is priced. %$* 1
almost everywhere the young pay the same premium as their more illness prone elders. %$* 1
a massive subsidy for the old paid for by the young. %$* 1
tens of millions of young people quite reasonably said no thanks to health insurance until the government mandated that they say yes. %$* 1
medicare and social security, granny's benefits are some 35 percent of the federal government-- %$* 1
federal government budget and are projected to increase to 40 percent in the next decade as the baby boomers retire. %$* 1
health care costs are running around 16 percent of gnp compared to nine percent in other developed countries. %$* 1
and we have no better health outcomes to show for it. %$* 1
end of life care, the heroic measures taken in the final three months before a predictable end are around 25 percent of total health expenditures. %$* 1
we simply don't have the money to afford the health care system we've got. %$* 1
when households want to consume something today that it can't pay for or doesn't choose to pay for, it can borrow money and pay it back with interest in the future, or it can borrow money and stiff its creditors through default, repaying debt with pennies on the dollar. %$* 1
it's no different for governments. %$* 1
if they won't cut spending, and they won't raise taxes, they can incur debt which the young will pay for with higher taxes later, or they can stiff their creditors through inflation, repaying the debt with devalued currency. %$* 1
young people are paying the costs of sluggish growth today, and they'll be paying the costs of profligate government tomorrow. %$* 1
and neither political party has anything constructive to say. %$* 1
the democrats don't want to cut entitlements, and the republicans don't want to raise taxes to pay for them. %$* 1
perhaps that's why young people vote less than their elders. %$* 1
tonight they can make up for that lapse by voting twice, before the debate and after, after they've heard tonight's stellar panelists address the little noticed issues of america's intergenerational divide. %$* 1
and with that, it's my privilege to turn the evening over to john donvan and our outstanding group of panelists. %$* 1
thank you. %$* 13
and i'd just like to invite one more round of applause for robert rosenkranz, please. %$* 13
true or false, grandma's benefits imperil junior's future? %$* 13
that's what we're here to debate, another verbal joust for intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
we're at the skirball center for the performing arts at new york university where our motion is this: "grandma's benefits imperil junior's future." two teams will argue that proposition from opposite sides, for it and against it. %$* 13
only one team wins, and you, our live audience, will be choosing the winner. %$* 13
they will be playing for your votes. %$* 13
so let's meet our panel. %$* 13
first, a life-long republican who is encouraging her party to get back to basics, fox news commentator, margaret hoover. %$* 13
her debating partner is a real estate investor and media mogul, a chairman of u.s.news and world report, mort zuckerman. %$* 13
opposing them at the facing table, a doctor who went on to become chairman of the democratic national committee, the former governor of vermont, howard dean. %$* 13
and joining him, an economic analyst and author of the book age of greed and editor of challenge magazine, jeff madrick. %$* 13
so this is a debate. %$* 13
it's a contest. %$* 13
there will be winners, and there will be losers. %$* 13
and you, our live audience here at the skirball center will be making the choice who wins and loses. %$* 13
by the time the debate has ended, you will have been asked to vote twice, once before and once again after the debate. %$* 13
and the team that has changed the most minds in the course of the debate will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so let's go to the preliminary vote. %$* 13
you all have key pads at your seat. %$* 13
our motion is this: "grandma's benefits imperil junior's future." if you agree with the motion, if you are with this team, push number one. %$* 13
if you disagree, you're with this team, push number two. %$* 13
and if you are undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and what will happen is the system will lock in the votes. %$* 13
if you feel that you made an error, just correct it, and the system will lock in your last vote. %$* 13
and remember again at the end of the debate, we're going to ask you to vote a second time. %$* 13
and the team that has changed the most minds, has moved their numbers the most in the course of the debate will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so onto round one. %$* 13
round one, opening statements by each debater in turn uninterrupted. %$* 13
they will last seven minutes each. %$* 13
and first speaking for our motion, "grandma's benefits imperil junior's future," i'd like to welcome to the lectern, mort zuckerman. %$* 13
mort zuckerman is a man-- %$* 13
you can make your way to the lectern. %$* 13
and mort, as you go there, i just want to explain to our audience, i'm sure they all know who you are, but you are a man who started in academia and then began to build things. %$* 13
you build buildings, and from those buildings, you built a fortune. %$* 13
and from that fortune, you became a media mogul. %$* 13
you are the owner of the u.s.daily news. %$* 13
you are the editor in chief of u.s.news and world report, on the forbes list of wealthiest americans. %$* 13
you do not own forbes. %$* 13
but on that magazine list, you are number 188. and i'm just wondering if you did own it, would you get to tweak the numbers a little bit? %$* 13
they were referring to my age, not my rank. %$* 144
ah. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, arguing for the motion first, mort zuckerman. %$* 13
well, as you've just heard, america's in very difficult shape. %$* 144
and the difficult truth that we must face is that we are on the verge of an exploding public sector debt that can have a very, very negative effect on our economic future. %$* 144
as one cynic put it, our future isn't what it used to be. %$* 144
social security was born amid harsh times of the great depression, marked by unemployment, homelessness and even starvation. %$* 144
we then made a deal with the american workers, to wit, that nobody who paid into the system would be left empty handed. %$* 144
to this was added medicare, health insurance in the mid 1960s and the protection against inflation in the 1970s. %$* 144
these initiatives changed the economics of old age. %$* 144
in a mere four decades, poverty rates among the elderly, which had been three or four times that of the general population, fell below the rates for younger americans. %$* 144
to this day, social security still means the difference between poverty and economic security for millions of retirees, children and many american workers. %$* 144
it is the primary source of income for two-thirds of older americans and the single most important antipoverty program for children, millions of whom live in households supported by disability, survivor or retiree beneficiaries. %$* 144
it creates intergenerational benefits as parents and grandparents can live independently of their working children and often become the childcare providers for children while the parents work. %$* 144
when social security began making monthly distributions in 1940, there were 160 workers for every senior receiving benefits. %$* 144
today, there are about three workers. %$* 144
and within two decades, there will be two. %$* 144
demographic are destiny. %$* 144
the message could not be clearer. %$* 144
social security needs fixing. %$* 144
it has been fixed before. %$* 144
social security taxes have been raised 40 times since the program began, most recently in 1983.the initial social security tax was two percent, split between the employer and the employee, capped at $3,000 of earnings, which made for a maximum tax of $60.today the tax is approximately 13 percent, capped at $106,800 for a maximum of tax of $13,234, a multiple of 80 times the original tax. %$* 144
so what is to be done? %$* 144
despite the natural sympathy for those looking forward to their retirement, we cannot avoid the issue of social security insolvency. %$* 144
here are some options to deal with this problem, one, gradually raising the retirement age to reflect the longevity increases that have already taken place. %$* 144
in the future, retirement age should be indexed automatically to rise with longevity. %$* 144
two, raising employer and employee payroll taxes by up to one percent each. %$* 144
three, eliminating or gradually raising the cap on taxable payroll income, reflecting the fact that higher incomes are rising faster than the social security taxable earnings. %$* 144
four, increasing the earliest eligible age, eea, as it's called, from 62 to 65, which alone would extend the trust fund solvency by about five years. %$* 144
current retirees would be unaffected. %$* 144
and exceptions would be made for americans who cannot work longer due to injury, ill health, or other causes. %$* 144
modest reductions in benefits for wealthier recipients should also be considered. %$* 144
we must address these challenges soon or grandma's welfare will in fact undermine the quality of life for her grandchildren and give meaning to the phrase which my partner and i have found out, we'll both, quote, "blessed are the young for they shall inherit the national debt." i might add-- %$* 144
that was originally stated by my partner's grandfather. %$* 144
the greatest risk facing america's fiscal future comes from the projected increases in medicaid and medicare spending that could raise the deficits dramatically in the next couple of decades. %$* 144
arithmetic still matters. %$* 144
medicaid now pays for both health and long term care for roughly 55 million americans. %$* 144
it finances more than one third of all births in the united states, and pays the cost of almost two thirds of the people in nursing homes. %$* 144
the federal government underwrites 50 to 77 percent of the cost, depending on the income level of each state. %$* 144
even so, medicaid is the second biggest and fastest growing category of state spending. %$* 144
costs are up more than 60 percent in the last five years and are expected to exceed $450 billion this year and to keep growing by about eight percent annually for the next decade. %$* 144
in the next-- %$* 144
by the mid-1930s-- %$* 144
2030s, the 65 and over population will nearly double, and health care costs, which have been rising far faster than worker productivity since the end of world war ii, may be completely out of control, resulting in a tidal wave of federal spending. %$* 144
the basic fact is that the first baby boomer statistically retired on january 1 of this year, but there are 79 million more of them. %$* 144
multiply that by estimated annual benefits of $40,000 that they will be receiving, and you're looking at $3 trillion a year just for that portion of the population. %$* 144
erskine bowles, the co-chair of the bipartisan simpson- bowles commission, put it well, "this is a fiscal crisis that is completely predictable and from which there is no escape. %$* 144
this concern has been shared by many, many institutions, the post, the washington post, the fed chairman, bernanke, and countless others. %$* 144
now, the only way to cut entitlement costs is to cut entitlement costs. %$* 144
the current programs as they play out will be unsustainable without giant tax increases or huge cuts in other government programs. %$* 144
we should remember as we address this problem that less is enough if it comes earlier, so the sooner the better. %$* 144
now, this is a nation founded on opportunity, not entitlement, on thrift, not conspicuous consumption, on stewardship and not living for today, but taking steps to make sure that we are creating a better tomorrow, such that future generations would have as much or more opportunity and a better standard of living. %$* 144
to keep these entitlements under fiscal control is about keeping the american dream alive. %$* 144
i know the american dream because i'm one of the people who was attracted to this country many years ago from canada where 50 percent of the graduating class of american universities moved to the united states, attracted as we were by the remarkable energy and optimism and mobility and upward mobility of this country, not to mention the president, john kennedy. %$* 144
today it is canada's government that has shown best how to manage these kinds of problems as they work their way through perilous economic times without threatening its future. %$* 144
but much as i like canada, i don't want my children moving there because of the narrowing of opportunity at home. %$* 144
mort zuckerman, i’m sorry. %$* 13
your time is up. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, mort zuckerman. %$* 13
our motion is "grandma's benefits imperil junior's future.” and here now to speak against the motion, jeff madrick. %$* 13
he is the editor of challenge magazine. %$* 13
he is a thinker and a writer who comes to the topic of economics from the left. %$* 13
his most recent great pithy statement to be attributed to him is “the last thing we need right now is a tax cut.” he wrote a book called “the age of greed,” which turns on its head the fictional gordon gecko’s notion that greed is good because greed is-- %$* 13
greed is not good. %$* 246
self-interest is okay. %$* 246
all right, ladies and gentlemen, jeff madrick. %$* 13
now i have a lot to correct in what mort said, not least of which is why he came to the u.s.canada is very cold. %$* 246
i’m delighted to be here with mort zuckerman, margaret hoover, and, of course, doctor, governor, and chairman, howard dean. %$* 246
i’m especially delighted to be here to defend social security and medicare. %$* 246
they are two of the greatest achievements of any kind made in america. %$* 246
mort’s listed-- %$* 246
please. %$* 246
mort’s listed why social security is so important, how many elderly it keeps out of poverty. %$* 246
it accounts for 80 percent of 40 percent of those who are elderly. %$* 246
it can account for well more than half of half of those who are elderly’s income. %$* 246
medicare-- %$* 246
think of what the elderly would be doing without medicare. %$* 246
how could they possibly be paying $12,000 and $15,000 a year for health insurance? %$* 246
but you know some of this. %$* 246
and you’re going to say, well, let’s cut them back a little bit for the sake of fiscal responsibility. %$* 246
i’m going to go into that in some detail. %$* 246
but let me remind you and let me make this very clear. %$* 246
social security and medicare are not outrageously generous programs. %$* 246
the average social security payment is $14,000. poverty for two-- %$* 246
a poverty line for two is $13,000. medicare-- %$* 246
a typical employer-sponsored health plan will cover 88 percent of health needs. %$* 246
medicare, according to independent actuarial studies, will cover 76 percent of medicare. %$* 246
big deductibles, big co-payments, not a gift. %$* 246
the elderly are not living wonderful lives because of social security and medicare. %$* 246
if they’re living wonderful lives, it’s because they made a fortune, coming from canada to america. %$* 246
let me get to the point. %$* 246
let me cut to the chase, because i had a lot to precede this. %$* 246
let’s be very clear about what social security adds to our future debt. %$* 246
in fact, let me step back a moment. %$* 246
social security and medicare have nothing to do with the current levels of debt-- %$* 246
nothing to do with it. %$* 246
the current levels of debt are a function of the great recession brought on, in my view, mostly due to the excesses of wall street, the bush tax cuts in the early 2000s and the spending on the iraq and afghanistan war. %$* 246
medicare part d contributed some but less than any one of those three factors. %$* 246
we don’t have debt because of social security and medicare. %$* 246
but what about the future? %$* 246
you would think, given what mort says, that social security accounts for about half of what’s going to happen to us. %$* 246
what do you think the benefits of social security as a proportion of gdp are going to rise to, as a proportion of our total income? %$* 246
they’re now about five percent of our total income. %$* 246
they’re going to rise to a maximum of six percent of our total income, one percent of gdp. you think we can’t afford that? %$* 246
you think social security is going insolvent on the basis of that? %$* 246
and you know what? %$* 246
even if we don’t raise taxes to cover social security, social security is not going insolvent. %$* 246
the social security administration and the cbo make a forecast. %$* 246
it is a conservative forecast of economic growth. %$* 246
even if we do nothing-- %$* 246
and if i leave one message with you, it should be this one-- %$* 246
if we do nothing, we will still have 78 percent of our benefits paid by the current system. %$* 246
medicare is a different story. %$* 246
but medicare spending is not going up in the next 10 years significantly as a proportion of gdp.it's going up after that. %$* 246
and why we hear a lot of alarmist talk about the aging of the population, true, there will be more aging compared to workers. %$* 246
workers will have a harder time paying for the aged. %$* 246
but that's not what's driving medicare costs up. %$* 246
that's not what's going to drive it sky high. %$* 246
it's the health care system, an inefficient health care system. %$* 246
and i'm going to leave that to my partner, dr. %$* 246
dean to discuss, how inefficient it is. %$* 246
summarizing quickly on those two issues, we can handle social security easily. %$* 246
it is not going insolvent. %$* 246
that is inflammatory, misleading and incorrect rhetoric. %$* 246
yes, i'm getting a little upset. %$* 246
i think i have cause. %$* 246
we still pay 78 percent of liabilities. %$* 246
even if we do nothing, what can we do? %$* 246
we can raise the cap, as mort suggested. %$* 246
we can raise the payroll taxes somewhat, 0.1 percent a year to 7.2 percent. %$* 246
and you know what? %$* 246
all the studies, all the surveys say people want to do that. %$* 246
medicare, we have to reform health care. %$* 246
and i hope mort, margaret and governor dean put all their effort into reforming health care because is what can undo america, not these entitlement programs. %$* 246
one last major point. %$* 246
we are a low taxed nation. %$* 246
we are almost the lowest taxed nation in the oecd of all rich nations. %$* 246
federal income tax comes to only 15 percent of gdp these days. %$* 246
used to come to 20 percent when george w.bush took office. %$* 246
can we raise taxes? %$* 246
you bet we can. %$* 246
ah, somebody's going to say from the other side. %$* 246
but that will slow economic growth. %$* 246
i leave you with one fact in my last 39 seconds. %$* 246
george w.bush cut taxes sharply in 2001 and 2003.he promised growth, and he promised jobs. %$* 246
and all those people who talk about the poor job creators whose taxes we have to cut, consider this: we have the slowest rate of gdp growth after the bush tax cuts from trough to peak. %$* 246
i mean before the devastation of late 2007 and the great recession, the slowest rate of gdp growth, 2001 to 2007 in any comparable period in post-world war ii history. %$* 246
and job growth was even worse, almost no jobs were created after the bush tax cuts. %$* 246
thank you. %$* 246
jeff madrick, your time is up. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 246
so we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence scared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two fighting it out over this motion: "grandma's benefits imperil junior's future." you've heard two of the statements, and now onto the third. %$* 13
i'd like to introduce margaret hoover, a fox news political commentator. %$* 13
she is the author of a book called "american individualism," which spells out her vision for a republican party that gets back to its roots. %$* 13
the title, i understand, you lifted from an author in the past, who would be whom? %$* 13
i punked it from herbert hoover. %$* 633
and your relationship to herbert hoover? %$* 13
he was my great grandfather, though i never knew him. %$* 633
he passed away 13 years before i was born. %$* 633
but you're bringing us the past and the future tonight. %$* 13
i found surprisingly hoover channels the millennial ethos. %$* 633
ladies and gentlemen, margaret hoover. %$* 13
thank you, john, and thanks to bob rosenkranz for the opportunity to participate here tonight on a stage with such distinguished public figures. %$* 633
i am well aware that i am the junior on this stage. %$* 633
and as such, i will argue in favor of this motion from the perspective of junior whose future is imperiled by grandma's benefits. %$* 633
the juniors in this argument are the millennials. %$* 633
this is the rising generation in america, 30 and unders, born at beginning of the reagan era to the end of the clinton presidency. %$* 633
at 33 years of age, i am on the cusp of this rising generation and have been paying into social security and medicare for eight years. %$* 633
i am told that as long as i pay into the system, this system will be there for me. %$* 633
by the time i reach my full retirement age of 67, 34 years from now in 2045, i'll expect to receive the same benefits equal to that which i paid into the system. %$* 633
and if i have planned on this, i will find my future severely imperiled. %$* 633
because eight years before i retire, the social security trust fund will have been depleted. %$* 633
i will be surprised to discover that this trust fund was actually a myth, that it was in fact just a surplus of ious that had been lent out to other agencies of government to pay for their expanding programs. %$* 633
beginning in 2037, social security will have to rely solely on the revenues from payroll taxes, which will be insufficient to cover the benefits promised to me and my generation. %$* 633
in addition, under current law, because of program insolvency, benefits will have to be cut by 23 percent or payroll taxes raised 30 percent. %$* 633
this sudden adjustment imperils the millennials economic future, affecting the poorest of those who are already dependent upon benefits. %$* 633
the rude awakening is that social security, medicare and medicaid were set up as pay as you go-- %$* 633
they were never set up as trust funds. %$* 633
they are pay as you go programs. %$* 633
the federal government does not and never has saved payroll tax revenues. %$* 633
these have always been generational transfer programs from workers to retirees, such that the benefits for grandma come directly out of the pockets of junior. %$* 633
by the time the first millennials reach their 40s in 2021, the cost of medicare alone will be greater than our country's total defense spending. %$* 633
put all together with baby boomers hitting retirement, grandmas living longer, medical costs spiraling upwards, social security, medicare expenses will consume about 12 percent of the nation's economic output in 2035, triple what it was in 1971. %$* 633
i would be remiss also if i didn't mention what we all know, which is that large parts of the federal budget are being financed by debt, 42 cents on every dollar. %$* 633
and this debt, too, must be paid back. %$* 633
by 2021, interest payments on the debt will be a bigger portion of the budget than our discretionary funding, which will contribute to a crowding out of spending in education, infrastructure, national defense and everything else that might be considered investment in our future. %$* 633
we all know this is unsustainable. %$* 633
and the need for reform is obvious. %$* 633
this is not an appropriate legacy for grandma to leave to junior because it defies the social contract in which each generation strives to leave the country better off than it inherited it from its parents. %$* 633
we need to revise the social contract to reflect the changes in our society in a way that keeps the faith with grandma, does not cut her benefits on which she is now relying, but stops making promises to junior that we simply cannot keep. %$* 633
we can have a generous, compassionate social welfare program for the elderly which is consistent with a dynamic economy in which workers have multiple employers over their careers, stay active and healthy in the work force into their 70s. %$* 633
this will require removing disincentives to longer careers, asking the more successful to shoulder more of their own retirement costs and health costs, and building stronger incentives for innovation and efficiency into our health system. %$* 633
change is coming one way or the other, and it will either be deliberate, careful and well thought out, or it will be imposed by a chaotic and indiscriminate way. %$* 633
if we take it upon ourselves to correct the-- %$* 633
america's social contract and be proactive, there will be nothing to fear from these changes. %$* 633
this is the normal process of each generation of americans, improving upon the strong institutions built by earlier generations. %$* 633
and the millennial generations, the juniors of tonight's motion, want to be part of that solution. %$* 633
you are likely to hear from our opponents an unwavering commitment to early 20th century social insurance models and an inability to adapt them and their spirit to the 21st century economy and population. %$* 633
they may accuse us of trying to take grandma's benefits away from her or suggest that we believe that the federal safety net with a mistake in the first place. %$* 633
this is not true. %$* 633
the only people who are talking about taking away grandma's benefits are those who want to scare seniors for political reasons. %$* 633
they may argue as well that entitlements, the benefits about which we are debating tonight, social security, medicare, and medicaid, are not the problem at all, that the real problem for junior is skyrocketing health care costs. %$* 633
this is a tricky tactic intended to shift the focus of the debate. %$* 633
health care reforms are an important subject, just not the subject of tonight's debate. %$* 633
the system that pays grandma's benefits is imperiling junior's future by making promises to junior that it cannot keep, by paying for these benefits through borrowing that contributes to mounting national debt, 14 trillion and counting, thus imperiling junior's fiscal and economic future. %$* 633
we encourage you to vote in favor of the motion. %$* 633
thank you, margaret hoover. %$* 13
our motion is "grandma's benefits imperil junior's future," and here to speak against the motion, howard dean, he's a doctor who left medicine to enter politics. %$* 13
he ran for president in 2004.he has served as a chairman of the democratic national committee, and you were governor of vermont for 12 years, and i want to talk to you about, very briefly, about your 12 years as governor of vermont. %$* 13
you came into office with a $62 million deficit. %$* 13
while there, you instituted a program that extended health care coverage to most of the kids in the state and you cut taxes. %$* 13
does that mean it's all easy because you-- %$* 13
should i be on the other side of this debate? %$* 634
ladies and gentlemen, howard dean. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 634
first of all, i hope to be able to match margaret. %$* 634
she actually stuck to the time and that's not so easy. %$* 634
she also did something else that is-- %$* 634
that you all have been victimized by for some time and that is frame the debate in such a way that we're focused on giving people big tax cuts at the same time we're focused on cutting benefits. %$* 634
the truth is that we do not have a medicare and social security problem in terms of what it is costing us. %$* 634
what we have is bad management, politicians who won't talk to each other and work with each other, lousy tax policy, selfishness as a public policy, and growing inequality in america. %$* 634
this is not an issue about taxes. %$* 634
so a few facts, social security is in fact a trust fund. %$* 634
there are $2.6 trillion in the tax fund. %$* 634
they are invested in treasuries in the social security fund. %$* 634
by 2020 there will be $3.5 trillion in the social security trust fund set aside, put aside by you for spending by you. %$* 634
is there a shortfall in social security? %$* 634
yes. %$* 634
is that the single biggest problem of our deficit? %$* 634
no. %$* 634
you know the single largest factor in our national debt is? %$* 634
this is the cbo, this is not some leftwing democratic think tank like msnbc.sixty percent of the deficit in 2019 is due solely to the bush tax cuts, 60 percent. %$* 634
now, that's a fact, i'm not-- %$* 634
if you don't want to raise taxes, be my guest, but if this is a debate between raising taxes and dealing with social security, you should know that because these neither of these problems is the big problem, the problem is not social security. %$* 634
i agree with mort, there are a lot of things you can do about this. %$* 634
margaret mentioned some good things you can do about social security. %$* 634
we have to tweak social security, yes, it's not a big problem. %$* 634
medicare, medicare is not the problem. %$* 634
its costs are out of control. %$* 634
there's a reason for that. %$* 634
the costs of the entire health care system in the united states of america are out of control. %$* 634
there's no way you're going to control medicare costs without doing something about the rest of the health care costs, and that means we have to have real health care reform, which we have not had. %$* 634
the real health care reform has not taken place either under romney care/obama care or whatever the republicans want to call it these days, it has not taken place because the entire reimbursement system of the health care, medicare, or private sector, encourages me to do as much as i can to you whether it works or not, and the more i do, the more i get paid. %$* 634
we need to fundamentally get rid of the fee for service system, capitated care, some of the things in the health care bill such as accountable care organizations, vertically integrated care, will solve the medicare problem, period. %$* 634
we do not need to privatize either one of those programs. %$* 634
and for those of you on social security, could you imagine if president bush had has his way and we'd privatized social security shortly before 2008, i don't think many of you would have been able to afford the $40 ticket that you paid to get in here. %$* 634
so let us not allow the right wing to focus on these two programs or the idea that we ought to reform them. %$* 634
let's reform our tax system so we have a more equal more fair society and then we can talk about how to deal with these systems. %$* 634
now, what can, in fact, we do? %$* 634
we talked a little bit about how to fix medicare. %$* 634
we do need to start paying people in a global budget, pay the hospitals and the doctors a flat fee for taking care of people. %$* 634
then, all of a sudden, guess what? %$* 634
prevention will pay. %$* 634
nobody invests in prevention today except for kaiser or self-insured major corporations. %$* 634
we can change all of that. %$* 634
there need to be some reforms, but we do not need to make this a private system, and we do not need to withdraw government support from this system. %$* 634
we don’t even need to reduce benefits. %$* 634
we do need to change the way we pay for health care, not just to save medicare and older people. %$* 634
we need to save business by doing this. %$* 634
we need to save individuals by doing this. %$* 634
we fundamentally have to reform health care. %$* 634
let’s not use medicare and social security as the victim. %$* 634
the fact of the matter is that young people inevitably are going to end up as my age. %$* 634
and when they do, they’re not going to want these programs to disappear. %$* 634
the elderly used to be the poorest group in american until in 1926 the farm states where the depression started began social security, which has then spread to a national program by roosevelt in 1933.so this is a core program. %$* 634
we just need to make it work and we just need some mild tweaks. %$* 634
health care needs a lot of tweaks, but the whole system needs tweaks, not simply medicare. %$* 634
and we should stop victimizing medicare for the sake of keeping our taxes absurdly low. %$* 634
the fact is people need to pay their fair share in america, and the bush tax cuts need to sunset. %$* 634
you know, when the taxes were at bill clinton’s rate, the economy was a whole lot better than it is now. %$* 634
and i wouldn’t mind going back to those taxes and paying my fair share at all. %$* 634
conclusion, the solution to this problem is not to return the elderly to poverty. %$* 634
the elderly programs do not harm young people in this country, because if we did not have them, you would be living with them so you could take care of them at the same time as you tried to make your own lives. %$* 634
these programs were put in for a reason. %$* 634
it is a social compact. %$* 634
and i’ll close with the words of oliver wendell holmes. %$* 634
taxes are the price we pay for civilization. %$* 634
and for those who continue to want to avoid them more and more, seeking tax cuts when we already have enormous deficits, you will end up paying the price, because-- %$* 634
and i say this not as somebody who’s a liberal or on the left. %$* 634
i say this as a social observer. %$* 634
there is no society on the face of the earth now or in the past which has not collapsed when the gap between the wealthiest and the poorest in that society has become too big. %$* 634
we are going down a very dangerous road. %$* 634
and cutting medicare and social security are the last things we should be doing, not the first. %$* 634
thank you, howard dean. %$* 13
and that concludes opening statements and round one of this intelligence squared u.s.debate where the motion being argued is "grandma's benefits imperil junior's futures.” now, remember, keep in mind how you voted at the top of the evening because, once again, at the end of the debate, we’ll ask you to vote again on the quality of the arguments. %$* 13
and the team that has moved its numbers the most will be declared our winner. %$* 13
now, onto round two. %$* 13
this is where the debaters address each other directly and they answer questions from the audience and from me. %$* 13
we’re at the skirball center for the performing arts at new york university. %$* 13
we have two teams of two debating this motion: "grandma's benefits imperil junior's future.” you’ve heard the side arguing for this motion, saying that basically we’re looking at a mathematical inevitability. %$* 13
the money is simply going to run out and that at the rate we’re going, social security and medicare are either going to break or they’re going to break us and that changes, significant changes are needed to avoid that outcome. %$* 13
the side arguing against them is saying that that doomsday scenario is greatly exaggerated, that in fact these programs are good programs, that they are generally well-managed, and that the problem is essentially at the core of medical expenses in the system, and that social security itself is, as structured, not really in fiscal danger. %$* 13
so i want to go first to the side that’s arguing against the motion and bring up the number that your opponent margaret hoover brought up, which is 2037, the year 2037, at which point, as she says, it is projected that the trust fund that was set up for social security is going to run dry. %$* 13
and this is not a number she’s pulled out of thin air. %$* 13
this is 2036, 2037, ’38, around there. %$* 13
it’s generally thought that that actuarial prediction is pretty good, pretty on. %$* 13
so i want to put to your side, what about that? %$* 13
what about the stark fact that that money will be gone? %$* 13
jeff madrick. %$* 13
let me take that. %$* 246
at that point, social security-- %$* 246
remember, social security is a pay-as- you-go system. %$* 246
and, margaret, it's not a rude awakening. %$* 246
it was always known to be a pay-as-you-go system. %$* 246
it was never said to be a trust fund. %$* 246
when that money runs out, money will still be coming in from workers. %$* 246
enough money will be coming in, as i said earlier, to pay according to the same estimates that said the trust fund wouldn't run out in 2037, to pay 78 percent of current benefits. %$* 246
so when people say, and you hear it all the time, and i'd like to ask mort what he means by insolvency and social security. %$* 246
when people say social security is going insolvent, and then they tell us, as we better cut the benefits now in order to save it, well, the benefits are going to be cut. %$* 246
and they may even be cut less without doing anything than you would like to do now. %$* 246
that's what's happened. %$* 246
that's what happened-- %$* 246
all right. %$* 13
margaret hoover. %$* 13
so no one is saying we should cut benefits now, especially to the seniors to whom we have promised. %$* 633
there's no one out there saying that except the aarp who is trying to scare grandma into continuing to not vote for entitlement reform, which is imperiling junior's future. %$* 633
i want to go back to this notion that 78 percent of benefits will be paid out because when you think about it, that's not a good deal. %$* 633
i put in money my entire lifetime, and then, presuming that the benefits are going to be there, i can only expect to get 78 percent out? %$* 633
that's just not a good deal for the worker. %$* 633
so-- %$* 633
did i answer the question that was-- %$* 633
yeah, i think so. %$* 13
do you want to go back to-- %$* 13
well, let me very quickly respond. %$* 246
you say nobody's calling for reductions in benefits, but of course all kinds of people are currently calling for reductions in benefits. %$* 246
who? %$* 633
simpson bowles. %$* 246
when you raise the-- %$* 246
they're talking about reduction on future benefits, but no one %$* 633
when you raise the retirement age, it's a cut in benefits. %$* 246
if you raise the eligibility retirement age from 65 to 67, that's a cut in benefits of 13 percent. %$* 246
some of the proposals out there cut benefits, in fact on 40 percent of men, some of the proposals cut benefits by 20 percent. %$* 246
these are proposals that are already out there. %$* 246
this is not a fiction. %$* 246
mort zuckerman. %$* 13
people are proposing that. %$* 246
mort zuckerman. %$* 13
that's not the only proposals that are out there. %$* 144
and we're basically talking about people just coming into the system having to deal with it. %$* 144
i mean, the fact is when fdr introduced social security, the average life expectancy was 62.it's now 80.you don't have a system that doesn't take that into account unless you just want the system to go bust. %$* 144
so you've got to find some way to correlate revenues and ultimately payouts. %$* 144
so i don't think these are unreasonable things to have some way of-- %$* 144
and we've done it. %$* 144
we've done it many, many times, okay? %$* 144
we did it in 1983 when tip o'neill as the speaker of the house, and president reagan got together and did that, okay? %$* 144
they improved the fiscal stability of that thing. %$* 144
we want these things to work. %$* 144
if you can guarantee that this thing is going to work by one magical system or another, great. %$* 144
but you can't. %$* 144
howard dean. %$* 13
not with all the people who are going to be retiring, the 79 million people who-- %$* 144
howard dean. %$* 13
are baby boomers. %$* 144
let me just remind everybody that the question is, do grandma's benefits imperil junior's future. %$* 634
the answer is no, they clearly don't. %$* 634
so we're talking here about making some adjustments. %$* 634
let me tell you what adjustments. %$* 634
i object to mort's view, even phraseology that the system will go bust. %$* 634
jeff has said it will not, and margaret's actually said 78 percent of the benefits is a bad deal. %$* 634
but that is not the same as going bust. %$* 634
secondly, here's what needs to be done. %$* 634
number one, wealthy pay taxes on their benefits. %$* 634
i think that's a good thing. %$* 634
it's a better way than means testing. %$* 634
i think it's a good thing. %$* 634
those taxes should go back into the social security trust fund, not go into the general fund. %$* 634
number two, no matter how attractive they may be politically, do not give payroll tax cuts. %$* 634
that money goes into social security. %$* 634
right now we're simply adding it to the national debt and then putting it back in the social security trust fund. %$* 634
that is not going to help. %$* 634
just let people pay into it. %$* 634
this is an actuarial fund, and it ought to be fully funded. %$* 634
next, we need to have a different immigration policy. %$* 634
for all those people who are screaming and yelling about all the immigrants coming in here and screwing up the economy, look at alabama right now where the hispanic population is fleeing, crops are rotting in the field. %$* 634
howard, can you bring this back to-- %$* 13
yeah. %$* 634
to the benefits. %$* 13
immigrants contribute greatly to social security, and the illegal immigrants contribute greatly to social security because they have fake social security numbers, and they never get any of that money back, so they actually boost the fund up. %$* 634
true. %$* 634
and secondly, immigration built this country because if we have-- %$* 634
if we only have two workers paying for-- %$* 634
or three workers paying for what 168 used to pay for because we're not keeping up with our birth rate, then let's have some more talented, hard-working people come into this country and stop beating up on immigrants. %$* 634
if anybody in here has native american blood in them, they're not an immigrant. %$* 634
the rest of you are all immigrants, and it built this country. %$* 634
let them keep building this country and keep coming. %$* 634
that will solve the social security trust fund problem. %$* 634
margaret. %$* 13
will it? %$* 13
so you just admitted that there is a social security trust fund problem. %$* 633
ah. %$* 13
and i-- %$* 633
yeah. %$* 18
there is a social security trust fund problem. %$* 634
it is not imperiling junior's future. %$* 634
it is good for junior's future to have social security. %$* 634
even if the trust fund is imperiled. %$* 633
we had a-- %$* 18
we're going to fix the trust fund if only the republicans would get out of the way. %$* 634
so we need to fix it. %$* 633
no, no, no. %$* 633
but hold on. %$* 633
but what governor dean has just said that it needs to be fixed. %$* 633
and that is an implicit-- %$* 633
but it-- %$* 246
agreement with the motion. %$* 633
i have somewhat of the same question because-- %$* 13
because they put forward a series of - - the word "tweaks" was used. %$* 13
and this team stood up and used the word "tweaks" also. %$* 13
and i'm wondering where is the daylight between your "tweak" sets. %$* 13
i was wondering that myself. %$* 634
i thought they were arguing our side when they started this because-- %$* 634
i can tell you three things i agree with howard dean. %$* 633
i agree with we need to get fee for service. %$* 633
let's just get very clear about this. %$* 246
all right, jeff. %$* 13
let me let jeff madrick-- %$* 13
when you start talking about the insolvency of the system, to most people out there that means you will have zero benefits when the trust fund runs out. %$* 246
that's what insolvency means. %$* 246
when you use language like, it's going to go bust, that means benefits are going to go down a lot. %$* 246
they're not going to go down 20 percent. %$* 246
i see some people shaking their head. %$* 246
it doesn't mean that. %$* 246
they're not-- %$* 246
when you say "bust," you're talking about at least 50 percent, 60 percent. %$* 246
it's an extreme exaggeration, number one. %$* 246
number two, when we say "tweaks," small increases in taxes can bring that benefit back up to a hundred percent. %$* 246
is that a tweak that you're good with? %$* 13

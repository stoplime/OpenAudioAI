remember what i said about four percent of the world’s population consuming over 20 percent of the world’s natural resources - the drugs and, and all these other things? %$* 340
that greatly impacts the neighboring countries. %$* 340
it’s very, very important. %$* 340
and we should have some sort of a %$* 340
the, the constitution of mexico says that we have the freedom of movement. %$* 340
we are not denied the opportunity to go to other %$* 340
to other countries. %$* 340
but it doesn’t encourage - contrary to what you have seen in these myths - people crossing to other countries without papers. %$* 340
my organization does not encourage that. %$* 340
people should cross %$* 340
cross in a humane manner. %$* 340
and that’s what we are asking for - humane and comprehensive immigration reform. %$* 340
comprehensive - that 12 million people get a pathway to, to legal %$* 340
the document. %$* 340
and humane - having a humane manner in which people can enter, which doesn’t exist right now. %$* 340
enrique, do you %$* 135
do you believe that anyone who wants to come to america should be allowed to come here? %$* 135
i think there should be a process that they would go through. %$* 340
that right now, if you are poor, you don’t get that opportunity. %$* 340
and there should be that opportunity. %$* 340
we should have humane laws to address that. %$* 340
karen narasaki. %$* 135
well, i think this is where we get into these false choices. %$* 342
um, and one of the false choices here is, we either enforce and become a police state, or we let everybody in the world in. %$* 342
that’s not really the choice. %$* 342
i mean, if we want to deal with mexico %$* 342
as enrique says, a lot of the policies %$* 342
the trade policies and other things %$* 342
that americans have done is why %$* 342
is what drives a lot of immigrants here. %$* 342
that’s why we have a huge refugee population here. %$* 342
so what we need to do is - in addition to looking at what we are doing with the system here - we need to look at, what are our policies around the world? %$* 342
how much help are we giving to mexico and other countries, who are sending countries? %$* 342
how are we helping them to stabilize their democracies? %$* 342
how are we helping them to grow their economies? %$* 342
i mean, the philippines is one of the large %$* 342
the largest sending countries in the world. %$* 342
they get more money from remittances from filipinos who are around the world %$* 342
than they get in foreign aid. %$* 342
we have to change that. %$* 342
we have to really think outside the box. %$* 342
it’s not just about punishing people who are here who are looking for a better life, but it’s - what can we do as a nation to change how we approach the problem? %$* 342
because it isn’t a choice of, we beat up people, or we let everybody in. %$* 342
that is not the choice. %$* 342
but it does sound like that’s the choice. %$* 93
i have yet to hear anybody on the opposing team say whether they think there should ever be any immigration enforcement. %$* 93
do you think a penalty should ever be levied against somebody who comes %$* 93
we say %$* 342
into the country? %$* 93
as heather said, we believe in enforcement. %$* 342
and we are not talking about %$* 342
what would you do? %$* 93
we are talking about smart enforcement. %$* 342
but tell me what you would do %$* 93
but i am talking about %$* 342
if somebody comes into the country illegally. %$* 93
i talked about %$* 342
waging our health and safety. %$* 342
and i talked about, if we are gonna do %$* 342
but that’s not immigration laws %$* 93
and if we are going to %$* 342
and if we are going to de %$* 342
deportation, i don’t think it should be by raiding people, pre-dawn raids, with people wearing cowboy hats, carrying machine guns aimed at children. %$* 342
so should raids be at noon? %$* 341
i don’t think that’s who we should be, as a nation. %$* 342
should people wear different kinds of hats? %$* 341
i mean, i think it’s a legitimate question. %$* 341
i mean, i am not trying to make the joke here, but %$* 341
that’s mark krikorian. %$* 135
i, i have to say - and i have been doing this now for more than 12 years, specifically in this job - and i have got to say, i have never heard someone on that side of the debate say, “yes, this specific enforcement action” - and i am not talking about, you know, criminals, uh, you know, drug dealers or something - regular immigration violation - that “this specific enforcement action is ok. this, i approve of.” i have never found %$* 341
mark %$* 342
mark, that is not %$* 342
i, i want to answer this question %$* 338
a single person ever %$* 341
mark, that is not true. %$* 342
we supported %$* 342
daniel griswold. %$* 135
yes. %$* 338
heather %$* 338
we supported comprehensive reform %$* 342
heather, i, i would %$* 338
which had %$* 342
well, let %$* 135
let karen finish, and then daniel. %$* 135
yeah. %$* 342
and which had tough employer standards %$* 342
i am talking about actual enforcement, not the %$* 341
that they were done reasonably. %$* 342
not promises of future enforcement. %$* 341
is there anything that’s ever happened - any enforcement action in the past say 20 years - that’s, that anyone on your side would be able to say, “yeah ok, that’s good enforcement. %$* 341
that, i am all for.” %$* 341
all right. %$* 338
never. %$* 341
i have never heard a single one. %$* 341
all right. %$* 338
and i would %$* 338
daniel. %$* 135
i would favor enforcement, if we had a law that was %$* 338
and who doesn’t? %$* 341
i am very interested %$* 341
if we had a law that was enforceable, and we weren’t throwing money down a rathole, which is what we are doing now. %$* 338
and until recently %$* 338
all right. %$* 135
but it is enforceable %$* 93
hold on, hold on one second. %$* 135
but isn’t it interesting %$* 338
let’s focus on the specific question. %$* 135
is there any %$* 135
and go down the, the, the, the three of you here on this side - karen, enrique and daniel. %$* 135
is there any enforcement that you would consider to be “good” enforcement, in terms of immigration? %$* 135
not, not so much the wage and hour issues that you were talking about - and i take your point. %$* 135
uh, any enforcement of immigration laws that you would consider to be rational and not “money down a rathole”? %$* 135
daniel griswold. %$* 135
well, one, the law has to be rational. %$* 338
and our law is irrational. %$* 338
and we have two very different views here %$* 338
give me a rational law. %$* 135
a rational law recognizes the reality of the u.s.economy. %$* 338
we need these workers. %$* 338
we are better off with these workers. %$* 338
the reason half a million come a year - and not two and a half million but just half a million - is that’s about the demand of our economy. %$* 338
if we had a law that reflected our needs as an economy, our values as a nation, you would not have, uh, people coming across the border just to work. %$* 338
so in that case, the regulation would be %$* 135
if, if, if, you know, burger king here in, uh, you know, uh, austin, texas can guarantee you a job, you get a visa. %$* 135
yes. %$* 338
and if %$* 135
and if there is no job for you, you can’t just show up on a street corner? %$* 135
right. %$* 338
and that would be %$* 338
and that would be a law that you would support %$* 135
whatever happens in the market. %$* 339
and the wagering. %$* 339
and they, and they don’t come, if there is not a job. %$* 338
and it’s very expensive to come here and not have a job and hang around. %$* 338
in the 1950s, we dramatically increased the number of visas. %$* 338
illegal immigration dropped by 95 percent. %$* 338
that’s our vision. %$* 338
it’s a system that worked in the past. %$* 338
it’ll work in the future. %$* 338
and they are asking you to buy a pig in a poke. %$* 338
“this time, if we just spend enough money, if we just station enough agents on the border, if we just raid enough chickens %$* 338
and that’s absolutely false. %$* 339
so you can’t use false statements %$* 339
vernon %$* 135
and you can’t just lie to people %$* 339
“and, and the discount %$* 338
vernon briggs. %$* 135
“and the discount stores. %$* 338
it’ll, it’ll work this time.” %$* 338
and the reason %$* 339
the reason that it %$* 339
that illegal immigration failed during the 1950s was because we had this awful program called operation wetback in the early ‘50s, which was a massive roundup - of which nobody would defend on this side of, uh, of the, of the borders. %$* 339
and that we had a large number of illegal immigrants. %$* 339
when that program ended, because of the massive violation of civil rights, illegal immigration went down. %$* 339
and it wasn’t because we had %$* 339
we introduced more visas. %$* 339
well, illegal immigration %$* 338
in other words, you are going to acquire %$* 341
and it started going up, after the, the ‘60s. %$* 338
your view requires massive roundups. %$* 341
and i’d actually like to know, from enrique and karen, do they support %$* 341
we do. %$* 340
another bracero program? %$* 341
because that’s what he is talking about. %$* 341
these, these are %$* 340
roundup guest workers. %$* 341
using that terminology, like operation wetback, actually deported a lot of u.s. citizens as well. %$* 340
that’s right. %$* 338
if you were mexican, whether you were born in the united states or not, you were deported. %$* 340
and we have somebody here whose, whose, uh, mom was in a detention facility during the second world war. %$* 340
so we cannot accept this type of, of, of, of a situation at all. %$* 340
and, and the guest worker program %$* 340
well, that’s what the program is calling for %$* 341
when was the last time %$* 340
that’s what the program is calling for %$* 341
when was the last time you had a guest in your house and you said, “now i want you to clean the bathroom and mow my lawn”? %$* 340
either you are a “guest,” or you are a worker. %$* 340
so we need to have some sort of a humane program. %$* 340
we need to have some sort of a humane program which addresses this issue. %$* 340
another thing that was mentioned about mexico. %$* 340
it, it is true. %$* 340
we don’t have a border patrol, but the military is down in the southern border, partially funded by the united states, because they are trying to stop the flow right down there, be %$* 340
before they get into, uh, mexico. %$* 340
and it’s very important to note, that if the wall had been built from the pacific ocean to the gulf of mexico on september 10th %$* 340
september 11th would have happened exactly the same way. %$* 340
one of the solutions that we should be doing is, is working with mexico, creating bridges of communication, and not triple fences of separation. %$* 340
we know people who have come from the north, from canada. %$* 340
yet the national guard, the wall, the minutemen, they are on the southern border. %$* 340
so we need to be working %$* 340
and i don’t want a wall up in the north, i don’t want a wall in the south. %$* 340
we need to be working with our neighbors, and treating them as neighbors, not as enemies. %$* 340
and that’s one of the things that we are looking for. %$* 340
look at the european common union, how they have gotten together and improved the economy of all of the countries. %$* 340
a rising tide raises all, all, all ships. %$* 340
and we need to do the same thing in helping %$* 340
by enforcing the immigration law along the border. %$* 339
in helping latin america. %$* 340
and we send billions to the middle east, and only millions to latin america. %$* 340
help mexico and the other countries in latin america develop, and the people will stay. %$* 340
we are still gonna need immigrants here, though. %$* 340
we are still gonna need it. %$* 340
all right. %$* 135
but let’s think about it intelligently. %$* 340
not with all this rhetoric. %$* 340
not with laughing about people dying at the border. %$* 340
i am the only one that’s here that’s at the border every day. %$* 340
has seen dead bodies out there. %$* 340
has picked them up. %$* 340
this is no laughing matter. %$* 340
our people are dying. %$* 340
it’s inhumane. %$* 340
if the world %$* 340
the world is watching us. %$* 340
ok. %$* 135
and they are saying, “how could this country allow them to build this wall, and attack a community in the land of the free.” %$* 340
enrique morones, thank you very much. %$* 135
but let me %$* 93
but wait %$* 340
i want to take another question from the audience. %$* 135
uh, judith zucker, i believe, on the right side, row h. could you stand, please? %$* 135
judith? %$* 135
ok.yes, please. %$* 135
state your question. %$* 135
and, uh, direct it to who you would wish to answer it, please. %$* 135
and i believe i asked, uh, a question. %$* 343
_____ in this era of homeland security, when we are supposed to be keeping our country safe. %$* 343
why is it that we have this immigration issue at such an extreme, uh, level at this point? %$* 343
and the irony is very strange to me. %$* 343
could i take a whack at that? %$* 341
please. %$* 135
go ahead. %$* 135
yeah, um %$* 341
mark krikorian. %$* 135
the, the %$* 341
the reason immigration policy is relevant to security now, is not just some opportunistic thing. %$* 341
“well, 9/11 was a big deal, so let’s concoct some rationale based on ‘security’ to reduce immigration.” kind of like these lobbyists for “farm subsidies” talk about “food security.” you know, “the, uh, uh, the terrorists are gonna %$* 341
are, are trying to attack us, so we need subsidies for food security.” no, this is an integral %$* 341
there is %$* 341
there is a reason that immigration policy and security are related. %$* 341
uh, years ago, world war ii, they talked about “the homefront.” that was part of the government’s propaganda at the time, and i use that in a positive term %$* 341
way. %$* 341
um, and it was designed really %$* 341
the, the use of the term “homefront” was to get people motivated to, you know, recycle their old tires and not grumble too much about butter rationing. %$* 341
but it wasn’t a real “front”; it was a metaphor. %$* 341
today, the homefront is not a metaphor anymore, as obviously we all know - it’s the actual front. %$* 341
because of modern technology, modern transportation and communications and weapons technology, the homefront is the real front. %$* 341
and the number one defensive tool we have - not “offensive” tool, but “defensive” tool - is immigration control. %$* 341
and the fact that we have enormous levels of, uh, illegal immigration. %$* 341
half of new immigration, mind you, each year’s %$* 341
half of each year’s immigration is illegal now. %$* 341
there is 800,000 illegal aliens settled here each year, plus 800,000 new legal immigrants coming from abroad. %$* 341
the fact that we permit this is an enormous vulnerability. %$* 341
because any system that the mexican illegal busboy can get through is something that a terrorist can get through. %$* 341
all right, mark. %$* 135
let’s %$* 135
let’s focus on this %$* 135
and the fact is that all of our borders have been used by terrorists. %$* 341
let’s focus on that for just a second. %$* 135
i mean, judith raises a point that sounds actually quite alarming. %$* 135
and you make the point that if it’s easy to walk into the united states, uh, under whatever pretense you want, um, that we are less secure. %$* 135
but what is the evidence that changing immigration policy will make us more secure? %$* 135
what is the specific threat that will be eliminated? %$* 135
and, and how does it specifically manifest itself in the immigrant population? %$* 135
that i haven’t heard. %$* 135
sure. %$* 341
now, good question. %$* 341
um, we looked actually, uh, after %$* 341
after 9/11, we looked at the 48 al-qaeda related terrorists who had either committed criminal acts or who had been arrested before they were able to commit their crimes, starting with the first world trade center attack, finishing with 9/11.and there were a lot in between - either smaller attacks, or conspiracies - that were, um, interrupted. %$* 341
and the majority of those people committed immigration violations. %$* 341
the fact is that a more, uh, vigorous, consistent, comprehensive enforcement of the immigration laws would have exposed probably - as far as we can tell - every single major terrorist conspiracy, uh, against the united states. %$* 341
even when you look at 9/11.the fact is that, four of the hijackers were - in some form or another - illegal aliens. %$* 341
and one of them came to study english, and then just never showed up, and there was no way for us to know. %$* 341
uh, a couple had overstayed. %$* 341
one had overstayed earlier, and shouldn’t have been allowed back in but was. %$* 341
others %$* 341
one of them was an illegal alien and was stopped by the police for driving - whatever it was - 95 miles an hour in a 50 mile an hour zone and nobody checked whether he was legal or illegal. %$* 341
so that %$* 341
the fact is that, every major terrorist, uh, uh, conspiracy in the united states - every effort at attacking the united states has involved - must necessarily involve immigration law. %$* 341
and has - almost inevitably, and almost always will involve - violations of immigration law %$* 341
john %$* 338
that if we detect %$* 341
can i respond to that? %$* 338
we can unravel %$* 341
it’s a bunch of nonsense. %$* 338
thank you, mark krikorian. %$* 135
who is “they”? %$* 338
dan griswold. %$* 135
who is “they”? %$* 338
they were born and raised right here %$* 338
dan %$* 135
and we’ll get a response from dan griswold. %$* 135
and then you, enrique. %$* 135
the last time i checked, not one of those 48 terrorists was a mexican. %$* 338
they weren’t from central america, they were from a particular part of the world, for historical reasons %$* 338
oh, so we discovered the arabs first. %$* 341
ok. %$* 341
and for historical reasons. %$* 338
uh, they were not from central america. %$* 338
none of them snuck across the mexican border to get into the united states, and yet that was where we were obsessed with our resources. %$* 338
so we were basically guarding our back door, while the terrorists waltzed in through jfk through the front door. %$* 338
it’s not an immigration problem. %$* 338
you know, every day %$* 338
today was a typical day. %$* 338
one million people entered the united states. %$* 338
about a million foreigners a day enter the united states legally. %$* 338
the vast majority of them turn around and go home within 30 days or 60 days. %$* 338
that’s our vulnerability. %$* 338
and yet, we are sending these resources down there to catch dishwashers and roofers and people who have no criminal intentions, no criminal records. %$* 338
they just want to come here and work. %$* 338
and you talked about “interior enforcement.” uh, again, what in the world are we spending all these resources going after businesses and peaceful, normal workers, when the real vulnerability are bridges and nuclear power plants and other infrastructure? %$* 338
that’ why the raids tailed off so much in 2003, it was because we were trying to guard our critical infrastructure. %$* 338
well, i like mcdonald’s, but it’s not critical infrastructure. %$* 338
if they want to hire a worker, i think they should be able to do, and we should create that legal channel. %$* 338
if we had a sensible legalization program, all these problems would be more manageable. %$* 338
we would be more secure, if our homeland security department was going after the real criminals and terrorists %$* 338
oh, you want to abolish all employer sanctions. %$* 339
that’s all you want to do. %$* 339
and not going after workers. %$* 338
vernon briggs. %$* 135
that’s what %$* 339
that’s what you are saying. %$* 339
uh, uh, uh, the reason we have these, these job sites - and these, these roundups and what have you - is because we have got a law that says they are not supposed to be there. %$* 339
and there are people that it have hurt. %$* 339
there are low wage workers - of all races and ethnic groups. %$* 339
i am not just concerned about mexicans. %$* 339
i am concerned about people of all races - who are both illegal immigrants and those who are hurt in this country by the %$* 339
by illegal immigration. %$* 339
you cannot %$* 340
you cannot %$* 340
it was martin luther king that said, “you cannot legislate morality.” and once again, they are %$* 340
they are using fear tactics - tactics of fear. %$* 340
as, as, uh, it was mentioned by daniel - none of those people were from latin america. %$* 340
timothy mcveigh was born and raised in the united states. %$* 340
and there is countless other people - within this country - that have committed terrorist acts. %$* 340
terrorism doesn’t come from a country; it comes from an ideology. %$* 340
and it comes from the policies that has been exhibited - especially these last few years - in many cases, by this country %$* 340
and people are reacting to it. %$* 340
nobody supports terrorism in general. %$* 340
nobody. %$* 340
we want to stop it. %$* 340
it’s horrible. %$* 340
we want to stop it coming. %$* 341
is that it, enrique? %$* 341
it’s horrible what’s going on. %$* 340
but look at what happened with the canadian border - with the, uh, the people that %$* 340
the millennium bomber. %$* 340
people that %$* 340
toronto, a terrorist cell. %$* 340
these types of situations %$* 340
we should be working with our neighboring countries, and intelligence - gathering an intelligence, working together. %$* 340
that’s the way that we solve these issues. %$* 340
just stop blaming %$* 340
continuously they are blaming one country - mexico. %$* 340
it’s not mexico. %$* 340
it’s, it’s, it’s, it’s an ideology. %$* 340
and let’s start working together. %$* 340
it’s very important that we don’t succumb to these scare tactics %$* 340
the reason %$* 339
and that’s why you won’t address the question of undocumented workers. %$* 339
and, and, and, and, and %$* 340
what they are trying to do, is use the politics of fear. %$* 340
no. %$* 339
if, if you want %$* 339
and many people in this audience are familiar with the politics of fear. %$* 340
if you look back in your history, the politics of, of fear was, uh, uh, one of the horriblest, uh, times in our history; with the annihilation of so many different people %$* 340
all right, enrique. %$* 135
i want to move to one, because we are running %$* 135
and i think that right now %$* 340
and we are running short on time here, and i want to get at least another %$* 135
but i %$* 342
actually, i wouldn’t mind, but i %$* 342
ok.go ahead, karen. %$* 135
go ahead. %$* 135
karen narasaki. %$* 135
and i actually want to, uh, respond to the professor’s question and your earlier question, and that is, uh %$* 342
in fact, there are some enforcement that we support. %$* 342
we just want it to work. %$* 342
and so, for example %$* 342
which? %$* 93
if i could finish. %$* 342
for example, uh, you know, it %$* 342
if we are going to have an employer system, uh, of checking - that’s great. %$* 342
but we need to have the database then be accurate. %$* 342
because it’s a big thing not to be able to get a job, because somebody has fingered you. %$* 342
and if anybody has tried to go straighten out something with the government, you know it’s not an easy task. %$* 342
so we just want to have a system that’s gonna work, where people have the right to challenge. %$* 342
where the government has an obligation to fix its database. %$* 342
where employers %$* 342
where the sanctions are not so high, that employers are just going to randomly start to racial profile as a way to avoid the problem. %$* 342
and let me say. %$* 342
i mean, one of the things about driver’s licenses. %$* 342
california passed a law a while ago, saying we are not gonna give, uh, driver’s licenses to undocumented. %$* 342
well, they started denying licenses to puerto ricans, because the people working at the dmv didn’t understand who the puerto ricans were. %$* 342
they thought - since they couldn’t produce a, um, a green card - that they were illegally here. %$* 342
we cannot put those kinds of decisions %$* 342
at that level. %$* 342
we need to have a more professional border enforcement. %$* 342
and we need more people. %$* 342
we need better training. %$* 342
border enforcement is great, and let’s have a citizens commission to make sure it’s done humanely, and to make sure that, that, uh, people are being held accountable for how they act. %$* 342
all right. %$* 135
but the bottom line, illegal immigrants don’t work. %$* 339
that’s, that’s %$* 339
that should be the principle. %$* 339
and if you would say that, i would go along with everything you said. %$* 339
but the bottom line of employer sanctions must be %$* 339
what we are saying is %$* 339
that illegal immigrants %$* 339
do not work in the united states. %$* 339
that’s the law of the united states %$* 339
since 1986 %$* 339
but can i tell you? %$* 342
because they don’t work. %$* 339
you, you were right %$* 342
and you were right, that employer sanctions did not work in the ‘90s. %$* 342
because there was a wink and a nod about really employers wanting them, and issues. %$* 342
well, you know, the immigrant community has come to grips with that. %$* 342
and there was very hard negotiations between %$* 342
with labor and chamber of commerce and businesses %$* 342
that was brokered by senator obama %$* 342
to come up with a system that works. %$* 342
that’s all people are asking for. %$* 342
all right. %$* 135
and we are reaching a %$* 135
we are not saying “no enforcement.” %$* 342
we are reaching a passionate point here in the question and answer. %$* 135
and i want to channel some of those passions into the summing up remarks of all of the, uh, panelists, who are going to give their final pitch for and against the resolution. %$* 135
speaking now. %$* 135
and of course, remember, the margin of victory for the resolution in the vote before the debate %$* 135
and we will have a chance to re-visit that vote at the conclusion of the final sum-up. %$* 135
but to conclude in the final rebuttal, against the resolution, daniel griswold will speak first. %$* 135
and those workers who come here illegally are not bad people. %$* 338
they are not “criminals” in the usual sense of the word. %$* 338
they are good, decent, hard-working family people who have run afoul of a very bad law that needs to be changed. %$* 338
you know, the, uh, the proposition here about “welcoming illegal immigrants.” some welcome. %$* 338
if you want to come here, you have to pay a, a smuggler, a coyote, $2,000, risk your life in the desert, and sometimes not make it and die a terrible death. %$* 338
live a shadow existence here. %$* 338
not having full employment opportunities. %$* 338
not being able to go home and visit your family, uh, on holiday, because you may not get back into the country. %$* 338
uh, that isn’t “welcoming” them. %$* 338
and these people may be low skilled, but they are not dumb. %$* 338
they’ll respond to incentives. %$* 338
if we give them an alternative - a legal alternative to the current dysfunctional system - i think they’ll obey the law and enter the country legally, as they did in the 1950s when we offered sufficient number of, uh, the bursaro visas. %$* 338
allow them to come in in a safe, orderly %$* 338
one. %$* 135
legal way, through our normal ports of entry, to assume all the responsibilities and privileges of working in our above ground economy. %$* 338
they love their country. %$* 338
believe it or not, not everybody in the world wants to live in america. %$* 338
in fact, most people don’t. %$* 338
they love their country, they love their culture and their family, and they want to stay home. %$* 338
and traditionally, back when we had a kind of, uh, “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy of immigration for mexico - most of them went back home, because that’s where their family is, and that’s where they want to go. %$* 338
right now, we have a broken law that needs to be changed. %$* 338
i think we should welcome more legal immigrants, and that’s why i urge to vote against this resolution. %$* 338
and those workers who come here illegally are not bad people. %$* 338
they are not “criminals” in the usual sense of the word. %$* 338
they are good, decent, hard-working family people who have run afoul of a very bad law that needs to be changed. %$* 338

daniel griswold, thank you very much, speaking against the resolution. %$* 135
now, to speak for the resolution, in final rebuttal, heather mac donald. %$* 135
well, we have heard, i think, a lot of, uh, sleight of hand by the opposing team, which is to conflate illegal immigration and legal immigration. %$* 93

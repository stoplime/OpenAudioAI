welcome everyone to another debate from intelligence squared us, i’m john donvan of abc news, and once again i have the pleasure and the honor of serving as moderator for the six debaters you see sharing the stage with me at the skirball center for the performing arts at new york university. %$* 13
six debaters, three against three, will be debating this motion, “organic food is marketing hype.” now, this is a debate. %$* 13
this is not a panel discussion or a seminar. %$* 13
it’s a contest. %$* 13
one team will win and the other will lose, and you in our live audience, several hundred of you, will be acting as our judges. %$* 13
by the time the debate has ended, you will have voted twice, once before and once again after you have heard their arguments to tell us where you stand on this issue. %$* 13
the team that has changed the most minds over the course of the debate will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so let’s now go to our preliminary vote. %$* 13
if you go to the keypads on the right arm of your chair, there a bunch of numbers but you only need to pay attention to 1, 2 and 3.our motion again is, “organic food is marketing hype.” if you agree with the motion, please press number 1, if you disagree, press number 2, and if you are undecided at this point, please press number 3.and if you feel that you have made an error, just correct it and the system will lock in the last vote that you recorded. %$* 13
so what we’re going to do is tabulate those votes and after opening remarks i will share with you where the preliminary votes stands at that point. %$* 13
and so on to the debate. %$* 13
round one: opening statements by each of the debaters in turn, seven minutes each. %$* 13
and we begin-- %$* 13
first i’d like to introduce lord john krebs, known just to us as john krebs on this side of the pond, here in the colonies. %$* 13
john krebs-- %$* 13
you can make your way to your lectern. %$* 13
john krebs was chairman of britain’s food standards agency, which is like our food and drug administration, the fda, except it was just the f, not the d. and john, you were not chairman in 2009. you had left the board, but it made a very-- %$* 13
it sent a thunderbolt to the system when it came up with a study of a comparison-- %$* 13
nutritional comparison between conventional and organic food and concluded what? %$* 13
that there was no difference in the health benefits. %$* 560
which rolled like thunder through the movement. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, john krebs. %$* 13
thank you very much, john, for those words of introduction. %$* 560
and i should emphasize to all of you, do feel free to applaud at any time during my seven minutes. %$* 560
i start off with a disadvantage because, as bernard shaw said-- %$* 560
george bernard shaw-- %$* 560
we are two nations divided by a common language. %$* 560
so i hope that you will understand what i am saying even though i am speaking the english that occurs on the other side of the pond. %$* 560
let me explain first of all where i’m coming from in this. %$* 560
as the former head of the food standards agency, i am not anti organic, absolutely not anti organic. %$* 560
but what i am is pro accurate consumer information, i am pro healthy eating, and i am pro scientific dispassionate analysis of the facts. %$* 560
i’ve got no vested interest. %$* 560
it makes no difference to me whether or not you eat organic food, but i do sometimes get angry about the marketing hype. %$* 560
and let me give you a for instance. %$* 560
just last week i was watching a television show about diet and health, and on the show there was a woman who was working for a low income, and she had three children, and she said to the interviewer, “i feel really guilty because i cannot afford the organic food to feed my children a healthy diet.” and that made me really cross, because she didn’t need to buy organic food to feed her children a healthy diet, although-- %$* 560
according to the surveys-- %$* 560
six in ten americans who buy organic food believe they’re getting a healthier option. %$* 560
and they are paying for it, because when you go shopping, if you buy organic food, you spend $1.60 for every dollar you would have to spend buying exactly the equivalent food produced conventionally. %$* 560
so, is it worth paying the extra for health benefits? %$* 560
the answer is a plain, straightforward, simple “no”. %$* 560
why do i say that? %$* 560
i say that because i’ve scrutinized the evidence. %$* 560
now if you look at the evidence, you have to ask yourselves two questions: who is saying it, and why are they saying it? %$* 560
and of course, if you listen to the organic sector that has a vested interest, they will pick and choose the evidence that supports their case, and no doubt we’ll hear that later on this evening. %$* 560
but i prefer to believe those groups of people who are independent, impartial, objective groups of scientists put together by official agencies to study the evidence with no side one way or the other. %$* 560
and it’s not just the u.k.standards agency that john referred, but at the last count, in eight different countries where the federal or national agencies have looked at this issue, in every case they have come to the same conclusion: there is no health benefit of eating organic food when compared with conventional food. %$* 560
furthermore, and this is a really important point, in the u.k. we have an advertizing standards watchdog, and a few years ago they penalized our two major supermarket chains for advertizing and claiming that organic food is healthier, and they were stopped. %$* 560
those supermarket chains were stopped from making that claim. %$* 560
and note this: they did not come back with a legal challenge. %$* 560
why did they not come back with a legal challenge? %$* 560
because there was no case to defend. %$* 560
there was no evident to support their case that would stand up in a court of law. %$* 560
so what are the supposed benefits, health benefits of organic food? %$* 560
some people think that it’s more nutritious, that it may contain more of those essential micronutrients, vitamins, or antioxidants that are supposed to protect us against cancer. %$* 560
but when you look at all the evidence together, sometimes organic food does contain more, sometimes it contains less, but taking the picture in the round, there is no-- %$* 560
absolutely no-- %$* 560
consistent difference. %$* 560
what about safety of food? %$* 560
because some people say, “well maybe i ought not to take the risk. %$* 560
organic food is more natural. %$* 560
it’s safer.” and indeed in britain 70 percent of the baby food sold is organic because parents are worried about what they’re feeding their children. %$* 560
well what are these safety issues? %$* 560
one thing that people are concerned about is pesticide residues. %$* 560
maybe the vegetables or the fruit that’s been sprayed in a conventional farm leave tiny residues on the surface that you may eat when you consume those vegetables. %$* 560
well two things to note. %$* 560
first of all, organic farmers also use pesticides. %$* 560
they just use a different set of pesticides. %$* 560
but secondly, and more important, those residues are they-- %$* 560
when they are present-- %$* 560
in such minute quantities that they are harmless relative to the natural dangerous chemicals that occur in all the food you eat. %$* 560
how many of you have ever drunk a cup of coffee? %$* 560
raise your hands. %$* 560
okay. %$* 560
quite a few of you have drunk a cup of coffee. %$* 560
well let me tell you, in that one cup of coffee there are more carcinogens that you would get in all the pesticide residues in eating conventionally produced or organically produced fruit and vegetables for a whole year. %$* 560
so if you’re worried about potential carcinogens in your food, don’t drink that cup of coffee. %$* 560
but of course, you don’t need to worry, because these chemicals may have the potential to be dangerous, but they are in such a low level in the food that you don’t need to worry about it. %$* 560
but in a way, this is missing the point, because you can argue hither and thither about how much of this chemical is in the food, how much of that pesticide residue is present, how much of this vitamin, and so on. %$* 560
what really counts is looking at the health outcomes. %$* 560
so, are people who eat organic food healthier than people who don’t? %$* 560
and that’s a pretty difficult question to answer, but there is one study that’s looked at it, and it’s an extremely large study. %$* 560
it’s called the million women study. %$* 560
it’s being carried out in the u.k., and it’s called the million women study, because it involves at least one million women who over a long time period record everything about their lifestyle, including what they eat, and subject themselves to a variety of health measures, including suffering from diseases. %$* 560
and that study shows that there is no difference in the health outcomes for women that eat organic food and women that don’t eat organic food. %$* 560
it doesn’t really matter to me whether you eat organic food or not. %$* 560
it’s your lifestyle choice. %$* 560
it doesn’t bring you any benefit. %$* 560
but what does matter to me is when poor people, like that woman i saw on television, feel guilty because they’re not feeding their kids organic food. %$* 560
just because of the marketing hype, they feel guilty, and that, to me, is an outrage. %$* 560
so, i urge you to vote for the motion at the end of this evening. %$* 560
thank you, john krebs. %$* 13
our motion is “organic food is marketing hype.” and now to open arguments against this motion, i’d like to introduce urvashi rangan, who is director of technical policy for the consumer’s union. %$* 13
that is the organization that puts out “consumer reports.” and, urvashi, your specialty there is labeling, and in particular when it comes to organic, you tell the rest of us whether if it’s organic on the label if it’s really organic in the jar. %$* 13
that’s right. %$* 561
it’s been part of my job for 10 years there, educating consumers about what organic means and what it doesn’t, and allow them to make informed choices about the foods they buy. %$* 561
ladies and gentlemen, urvashi rangan. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 561
good evening everyone. %$* 561
i’d like to address a few things that john brought up in this resolution, and the first thing is the resolution is not about whether organic is healthier or not. %$* 561
that’s not what we’re debating today. %$* 561
we’re also not debating whether it’s more nutritious. %$* 561
what we’re debating is whether it’s marketing hype or not, and that is what we’re trying to judge by the end of this debate. %$* 561
john brought up a few things that i’m going to address, including pesticide residues and sort of dismissing any level of harm whatsoever. %$* 561
and if you’re eating carcinogens in one thing, why not eat it in everything? %$* 561
that is simply a dangerous-- %$* 561
dangerous theory. %$* 561
and as a toxicologist for “consumer reports,” i have to say that we barely understand what one chemical does at one point in time. %$* 561
we have no idea what the multiple exposures to low-level pesticides-- %$* 561
chemicals, drugs, heavy metals does to anybody, and so, as a mother of two, and as many people are, if you have the health of somebody else’s hands in your hands and you’re responsible for them, you want to take extra measures to figure out what you’re putting in their bodies, too. %$* 561
i’ll leave that now and i’m going to launch into our side of the case, which is that “consumer reports” has been deciphering labels since 1936.our sole mission is to educate consumers about marketing hype, what it is, what it isn’t. %$* 561
and for many years, i have to say in my last 10 years rating labels we’ve come across a lot of labels that are marketing hype. %$* 561
natural: very few standards, no verification. %$* 561
hypoallergenic: also marketing hype, no standards. %$* 561
fragrance-free, free range. %$* 561
all of those labels are marketing hype. %$* 561
they have no standards. %$* 561
they have no verification. %$* 561
those are our two most important criteria when we’re rating labels, and those don’t meet any of them. %$* 561
on the other hand, organic food meets those criteria. %$* 561
it does have a comprehensive set of standards behind them, and it is verified. %$* 561
we don’t consider that to be marketing hype, and therefore we think you should vote against this resolution. %$* 561
so, let me give you some more examples of marketing hype. %$* 561
wonder bread, wonder brains. %$* 561
they had that out for a while. %$* 561
ftc took action against that, that they can’t call it that. %$* 561
maybe some of you recall the smart choices label program, a big green check mark that was industry sponsored, conagra, pepsi. %$* 561
you found it all over, including fruit loops, full fat mayonnaise, a couple other things. %$* 561
that’s also marketing hype. %$* 561
not such a smart choice. %$* 561
and one other one: the united egg producers used to have a claim called animal care certified. %$* 561
sounds really lovely like the animals were cared for, but it could have been used on eggs that came from chickens stuffed in the battery cages where they couldn’t stand up, put into towers of battery cages where all their poop and excrement basically rained down through the cages onto the floor, contaminating the ground, moving into the ground water: could be labeled animal care certified. %$* 561
they stopped doing that, but, again, that’s another example of what’s marketing hype. %$* 561
incidentally, organic production doesn’t allow chickens to be stuffed in those battery cages, and it’s just one of the reasons why organic offers a benefit over conventional. %$* 561
let me jump into five other big reasons why organic does carry more value, and first of all just to set the stage, congress passed an act in 1990, the organic food production act. %$* 561
the usda runs the national organic program. %$* 561
we have certifiers and inspectors accredited by the usda. %$* 561
this is a public program. %$* 561
everybody can participate in it. %$* 561
and, it is subject to accountability, it is subject to inspection itself. %$* 561
this is a credible labeling program. %$* 561
i don’t think we’re really wasting this much energy over something that is just simply marketing hype. %$* 561
but let’s get into five big reasons why organic offers benefit over conventional production. %$* 561
first of all, organic animals eat a diet free of poop. %$* 561
can you believe that? %$* 561
why am i saying that? %$* 561
am i a nutball? %$* 561
but no, conventional agriculture and conventional farming in this country actually picks up chicken litter from the bottom of the chicken coop, filled with poop, excrement, whatever that chicken ate-- %$* 561
including mammalian byproducts, cow brain, blood meal-- %$* 561
and guess what? %$* 561
animals eat that in conventional production. %$* 561
it also can include garbage, plastic roughage pellets, and this is the stuff that we freely-- %$* 561
in face, we call it a rich protein supplement. %$* 561
i mean, this is a protein considered useful for animal feeding. %$* 561
it’s not allowed in organic production. %$* 561
it’s just one reason why organic offers a benefit. %$* 561
second, organic is free of antibiotics; they cannot be used. %$* 561
antibiotic resistance is a huge growing public health problem in this country. %$* 561
we feed antibiotics to animals every single day. %$* 561
we wouldn’t do that with humans. %$* 561
we wouldn’t feed humans antibiotics every day. %$* 561
why do we do it in conventional agriculture? %$* 561
number two reason why organic offers a benefit. %$* 561
third, we feed animals-- %$* 561
chicken broilers in this country-- %$* 561
things like arsenic, if you can believe it. %$* 561
these are toxic heavy metals that we actually feed the animals. %$* 561
they act a lot like antibiotics. %$* 561
they help them grow better, they help prevent disease. %$* 561
and yet, the arsenic goes from their poop into the ground, it seeps into the ground, and the problem with conventional ag is people don’t think it moves anywhere. %$* 561
but it does. %$* 561
it moves into the ground, into the groundwater. %$* 561
we create big pits of manure that go up into the air and contaminate it. %$* 561
these things are controlled for in organic production. %$* 561
two last things. %$* 561
organic doesn’t allow the use of most synthetic pesticides. %$* 561
it’s true, as john points out, that some pesticides are allowed, but one report estimates that about 60 percent of the pesticides that are out there are classified as a known, probably, or possible carcinogen. %$* 561
if you can have food that doesn’t have those things, why wouldn’t you want to eat healthier? %$* 561
why wouldn’t that offer a benefit? %$* 561
but remember, this isn’t a debate about whether you would buy it, but rather whether it is truly a measurable difference and whether it offers a credible alternative to consumers who are buying it, and whether or not consumers who buy organic are currently being deceived in the marketplace. %$* 561
we would say no, and therefore we urge you to vote against the resolution. %$* 561
finally, i’d like to talk about synthetic fertilizers. %$* 561
we actually compost human waste in this country and we put it onto conventional crops. %$* 561
that’s right. %$* 561
what you put in your toilet can get composted and get put onto the food that we eat, and that’s how it gets fertilized. %$* 561
that is a prohibited method in organic production. %$* 561
you may not use human sludge as compost. %$* 561
it comes with a number of problems, including heavy metals. %$* 561
and finally, synthetic fertilizers rape the soil. %$* 561
and organic promotes it, and chuck will be talking a little bit more about that. %$* 561
thank you. %$* 561
our motion is “organic food is marketing hype,” and now to speak for the motion, the only actual farmer in the debate tonight. %$* 13
i’d like to introduce blake hurst, who is a farmer in missouri. %$* 13
he raises corn and soybeans and flowers along with his family. %$* 13
he’s done it all of his life. %$* 13
he’s also a writer who is published in the “wall street journal” and the “weekly standard” and other magazines. %$* 13
i’m interested blake, is it harder to farm or harder to write? %$* 13
i can’t make any money at either one. %$* 562
ladies and gentlemen, blake hurst. %$* 13
i’m used to not making much money. %$* 562
only tonight did i learn that i was a rapist. %$* 562
this will come as a surprise to my family and friends, who don’t think much of me, but think more than that. %$* 562
if you’ve ever driven through the midwest on a summer evening, your windshield becomes covered by bazillions of sticky glutinous gobs of insect guts. %$* 562
your windshield wiper can cause a wreck because it just smears the stuff around, making your windshield as opaque as the directions for assembling a christmas present. %$* 562
the bugs are corn borer moths. %$* 562
corn borers cause corn to drop ears, corn stalks to fall over. %$* 562
they also damage the husk of the corn, making it vulnerable to a soil-borne pathogen called aflatoxin, which causes liver cancer in humans. %$* 562
the insecticide bt produced by corn grown from genetically modified seed causes corn borers to swell like a balloon and to explode. %$* 562
i find this very satisfying. %$* 562
i imagine pops, like a string of firecrackers, like popcorn on a hot stove, as all across my fields corn borers explode. %$* 562
bt corn of course disqualifies my crop as organic, even though a nearly identical pesticide is available to organic farmers. %$* 562
and aflatoxin i should point out is completely natural. %$* 562
of course, we’ve on our farm lost our chance to be organic some 50 years ago. %$* 562
we have a picture-- %$* 562
we have a picture of my grandfather standing in front of a corn crib. %$* 562
he’s wearing a faded blue work shirt, overalls turned white from repeated washings, a broad-rim straw hat, and he’s carrying two ears of corn, one the before year and one the after, then after had a nitrogen applied to it, artificial raping nitrogen. %$* 562
the after year was much bigger. %$* 562
grandpa is grinning widely because he’s celebrating a record yield. %$* 562
i should probably point out that our farm has manure as a fertilizer source and at the time planted lots of legumes in long rotations: all practices recommended by the advocates of organic farming, usually writing in a sort of a tone of breathless discovery. %$* 562
yes, virginia, people were thinking about soil fertility long before the “oprah” show covered “food, inc.” when commercial fertilizer became available, yields went up, costs went down, including environmental costs, as we use less resources to produce the same amount of food. %$* 562
when this happens in other industries, it’s generally seen as a good thing. %$* 562
the father of the organic method was sir albert howard, a british agriculture scientist. %$* 562
he taught that disease, whether plant, animal, or human, is caused by unhealthy soil, and the secret to good health is farming organically. %$* 562
according to howard, “the war in the soil is the result of a conflict between the birthright of humanity, fresh food from fertile soil, and the profits of a section of big business.” that sentence could have been written a week ago and would have been just as unrealistic now as it was in 1949 when howard wrote it. %$* 562
you’ll notice then, as now, the farmer is strangely absent from this narrative. %$* 562
tools of big corporations bought off by seed corn caps and glossy advertisements, we’re only practicing industrial agriculture because we’re tools of the man. %$* 562
the truth is better captured by that picture of my grandfather smiling from year to year as he celebrates a record yield. %$* 562
you may find this bloodthirsty battle using chemical warfare, genetic manipulation distasteful. %$* 562
it’s clear that our opponents here tonight do so. %$* 562
they imagine farming as a holistic walk with nature as we reap her bounty with hardly a mark left on the landscape and a utopia as we discover that connection to soil has been lost because of the application of science to food. %$* 562
according to them we can walk back our dependence on petroleum, lose our addiction to chemicals and laboratories and be one again with nature. %$* 562
rarely has so much nonsense received so much attention from so many outstanding minds. %$* 562
organic production requires its own set of environmental trade-offs. %$* 562
organic food takes more land than conventional farming for the same amount of food. %$* 562
organic farming leads directly to more, not less, soil erosion because conventional farmers disturb the soil less. %$* 562
organic rules are arbitrary with some practices clearly forbidden because of political pressure instead of science. %$* 562
some of the most environmentally costly practices conventional farmers use are approved for the organic farmer as well. %$* 562
some of the practices most important for food safety are not available to organic producers. %$* 562
hunger is the darkest factor of all and always closer than we expect, particularly in the parts of the world that are most likely to farm organically, although they don’t call it that. %$* 562
nature doesn’t care whether we’re hungry or well-fed. %$* 562
we wrest what we can from her reluctant arms each year, and in order to have an adequate supply of food, we have to use all the tools available to us. %$* 562
that’s the truth. %$* 562
that’s the truth of this multi-front war we call farming, and as inconvenient as it may be to the critics of the present food system, that’s the way it will always be. %$* 562
eating organically is trendy, edgy, and advocated by all the right people. %$* 562
organics consumers shop as a form of conspicuous self-congratulation, a chance to pat themselves on the back for their social conscience, and to enjoy the superiority over the coupon-clipping bourgeoisie shopping at wal-mart, though organic consumers should know this: her choices have costs, real costs: environmental costs and costs when it comes to world hunger. %$* 562
according to the united nations food and agriculture organization, there are a billion hungry people in the world. %$* 562
every time someone purchases organic food, more water and more land are used to produce that food than to produce the same amount of food on my farm. %$* 562
that’s the reason why you should vote in favor of the motion. %$* 562
organic food is fashionable, cool, an attitude, a chance to identify yourself with beautiful actresses instead of old farmers in overalls. %$* 562
but mostly, organic food is marketing hype. %$* 562
thank you. %$* 562
thank you, blake hurst. %$* 13
so here is where we are. %$* 13
we are halfway through our first round opening statement by each side at this u.s.intelligence squared debate. %$* 13
i’m sorry, i’m going to rephrase that because this needs to be right for the radio broadcast. %$* 13
i said u.s.intelligence squared, and i’m going to reverse that. %$* 13
we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i’m john donvan as moderator. %$* 13
we have six debates, two teams of three, who are fighting it out over this motion: “organic food is marketing hype.” you have heard three of the opening statements, and now on to the fourth. %$* 13
i would like to introduce jeffrey steingarten, who is a bestselling author and food critic for “vogue” magazine. %$* 13
one of his more famous books is “the man who ate everything.” i apologize, jeffrey, i have not read the book. %$* 13
is it autobiographical? %$* 13
i’m referring to a very famous other person. %$* 563
well let me recommend the book and introduce once again. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, jeffrey steingarten. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 563
i started-- %$* 563
well i didn’t start out-- %$* 563
i started out as a lawyer and not as a food critic or a writer, and if this were a court i think i would ask the judge to exclude most of the previous testimony on the grounds that it was totally irrelevant to the proposition. %$* 563
to say that organic food is a marketing hype i guess means that all organic food is a marketing hype, that everything about organic food is a marketing hype. %$* 563
that doesn’t do you any good-- %$* 563
it doesn’t do the other side any good to show that there is an advertisement that shows healthy people by eating organic food, if they actually are. %$* 563
i doubt they’re eating the food on the set-- %$* 563
photographic set. %$* 563
so that’s marketing hype as well. %$* 563
i remember when i was on the fda-approved advisory committee right at the beginning, and we were given advisory powers, and one of the things that we were given was bst, bovine somatotropin, to increase cows’ milk production. %$* 563
and everything we were fed, except from one-- %$* 563
well you know, from the center for science in the public interest, was total hype. %$* 563
monsanto hired the farmers who sat in their offices, working with their computers. %$* 563
monsanto put overalls on them and everything, and they talked about how they knew that their cows were happy, producing all this extra milk. %$* 563
we know that cows overproducing get mastitis and then there is pus, if i can use the word pus, in the milk. %$* 563
no one wanted to use the word pus. %$* 563
and maybe pus is not bad for you, but i thought it was-- %$* 563
the fda was so afraid that we were going to vote against it, so they combined two committees, also the animal husbandry committee, all of whom were supported by the agriculture department or by industry, for example, monsanto. %$* 563
so that was lopsided and have always been lopsided, so much so that the other side was emboldened to move that it should be a crime for a milk producer to announce that there was no bovine somatotropin hormone in his milk because that would be marketing hype since there’s no difference. %$* 563
the forces against good food are very powerful in this country and it’s enough to make you paranoid. %$* 563
with all possible respect, our last speaker-- %$* 563
okay, i’m not going to say that you sounded like dick cheney, okay? %$* 563
but-- %$* 563
but he talked about farming as a multi-front war and that you have to wrest from nature that, you know, these kind of little rewards you, these little, you know, corn cobs. %$* 563
i know four or five farmers, and i’ve spoken to them all in the last few days so that i would be able to learn all about farming. %$* 563
there’s one that i’ll nickname farmer al who grows some of the best peaches in the country. %$* 563
they’re organic and they’re in northern california. %$* 563
and it took a while for al to start switching from non-organic to organic peaches. %$* 563
they’re better now. %$* 563
he was so mellow about it, about how you have to use this in order to avoid that pest. %$* 563
and i asked him whether he used round-up on his weeds. %$* 563
he said, “oh no, we just manage the weeds.” just as long as they’re not-- %$* 563
just as long as they’re not higher than about that, they won’t threaten the plants, the weeds won’t and also scattering eggs of predators to the pests and so on and so forth. %$* 563
al’s peaches are more expensive. %$* 563
there’s no doubt that organic food is on average more expensive, so our next speaker, i believe having read some of what he’s written, are going to say, as the farmer did, that it’s almost a crime with all the people starving to devote any resources to some kind of elite food. %$* 563
now, i know that the best vegetables that i’ve ever tasted were organic, and they were grown on dan barber’s property-- %$* 563
he doesn’t own the property; rockefeller owns the property-- %$* 563
but the property near his restaurant. %$* 563
conventional agriculture is not feeding the world. %$* 563
to say that organic agriculture could never feed the world is sidestepping the fact that organic-- %$* 563
that conventional agriculture is not feeding the world and it’s dependent upon oil selling at $45 a barrel, it’s dependent upon steady climate, and it’s also dependent upon relatively available water. %$* 563
okay. %$* 563
jeffrey steingarten, i’m sorry, you’re time is up. %$* 13
okay. %$* 563
thank you. %$* 13
thank you, jeffrey steingarten. %$* 13
our motion is “organic food is marketing hype.” and now here to speak against the motion-- %$* 13
i’m sorry, i’ve skipped a page. %$* 13
now here to speak for the motion, i’d like to introduce dennis avery, who is director of the hudson institute’s center for global food issues, who was for some time an agricultural economist who worked for the state department and writes extensively on food policy. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, dennis avery. %$* 13
to measure the depths of my sins, i’m holding up a book written by my son, alex avery. %$* 564
it’s entitled “the truth about organic foods” and it traces the history of the movement from germany in the 1920s on to our organic farming today, and the tragedy that organic farming doesn’t live up to the hype. %$* 564
the people who are buying it and consuming it and offering it to their families truly want to do the best possible thing, as speakers tonight have said, and i certainly don’t disagree with that. %$* 564
but this is not just an unfortunate failure to live up to the billing. %$* 564
it is now a serious international concern, because we are about to enter the biggest farming challenge the world has ever seen. %$* 564
we will have, by the year 2050, between 8 and 9 billion people. %$* 564
i expect that instead of 1.5 billion affluent people, science, technology, and trade will give us 7 billion affluent people. %$* 564
and if the chinese reach half of the pet saturation that we have in this country, that will mean another 250 million companion cats and dogs; none of them vegetarian. %$* 564
we will need to double world food production again. %$* 564
we will need to triple the yields on the best farmland, because that not only gives the highest yields and the least erosion, it displaces the fewest wildlife species. %$* 564
the great plains had 60 million bison, 100 million antelope, 3 billion prairie dogs. %$* 564
that’s three species. %$* 564
the poor land has more, far more, species. %$* 564
we are farming 37 percent of the land area now. %$* 564
if we produce for 2050 by simply extending the borders of the fields we’ll be farming 80 percent of the land area. %$* 564
and if you think conventional farming isn’t feeding people now, just wait. %$* 564
and the organic farmers can’t do this. %$* 564
the key is nitrogen. %$* 564
the earth had 1.5 billion people before we got nitrogen fertilizer. %$* 564
we would still be at 1.5 billion people were it not-- %$* 564
that might be better. %$* 564
you might think you prefer that, but you aren’t going to get there with zero population growth movements, and you aren’t going to get there with meatless mondays. %$* 564
you’re going to have to triple the yields again on the best farmland. %$* 564
plowing itself is a danger. %$* 564
summer of ’07, 12-inch rainfall in southeastern minnesota, second- largest concentration of organic farmers in the country. %$* 564
they not only had flooding; they had mudslides. %$* 564
whole hillsides sloughed off. %$* 564
sandy loam hills should not have been in anything but no- till farming. %$* 564
no-till cuts erosion by 65 to 95 percent. %$* 564
it doubles soil moisture. %$* 564
it’s the most sustainable farming system ever developed. %$* 564
and organic farmers can’t use it because you have to have herbicides to kill the cover crops so you can plant what you really want to grow. %$* 564
they can’t kill their cover crops. %$* 564
and the yields over all are about half as high. %$* 564
we had a famous study that came out in the summer of 2007 from the university of michigan, which has no school of agriculture. %$* 564
the lead author was a fully- qualified geologist. %$* 564
and they said organic farming can feed the world and more. %$* 564
you’re entitled to believe that, but they made a fairly serious mistake in the paper. %$* 564
they talked about one study in which green manure crops had put 1,500 milligrams per acre of nitrogen into the soil and that 66 percent of this nitrogen had been delivered to the seedheads of the crops. %$* 564
that doesn’t happen. %$* 564
everybody agrees that nitrogen fertilizer puts a higher percentage of its nitrogen into the crop seeds. %$* 564
thirty-three percent is the accepted figure. %$* 564
on green manure crops it’s 20 percent. %$* 564
the different between 66 percent and 20 percent is starvation for half of the humans, or the destruction of wildlife habitat on a scale never yet seen in this world. %$* 564
this is not truth, and it is not a favor to you or to the population of the rest of the world to tell something about organic farming that is demonstrably false. %$* 564
we will have to turn high-yield farming into higher-yield farming. %$* 564
thank you very much. %$* 564
thank you, dennis avery. %$* 13
finally, with our motion “organic food is marketing hype,” to summarize his position against the motion i’d like to introduce charles benbrook, chief scientist at the organic center, which makes you the only person who has the word organic on your business card. %$* 13
the center produces science with the goal of aiming to persuade all of us to go organic. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, charles benbrook. %$* 13
thank you, john, very much. %$* 58
first of all, i think i need to start with an apology to my esteemed colleagues on the pro side of this debate, because i’m actually going to speak to the motion. %$* 58
tonight we’re debating whether organic food is marketing hype, and the way that i understood this-- %$* 58
and i think probably most of the people on our side-- %$* 58
is that we’re talking about the companies and the farmers that grow organic food and sell it to people. %$* 58
they put claims on the label. %$* 58
there is advertizing, there’s lots of information on websites. %$* 58
i think we all have a pretty good idea on how companies market products and deliver information to consumers. %$* 58
and in the united states, as you know, there is a number of laws and regulations that govern what is marketing hype and what’s not. %$* 58
urvashi spoke to some of that. %$* 58
we’ve all heard the saying one aspirin a day helps prevent heart attacks. %$* 58
that’s kind of amazing that it does, but in large clinical trials, people that take an aspirin a day have a statistically significant lower risk of heart attack, and so the ftc and the fda have allowed that claim on-- %$* 58
in advertising for aspirin. %$* 58
but if you heard an aspirin a day prevents heart attacks, that of course would be marketing hype. %$* 58
to claim that it will prevent goes over the line into marketing hype. %$* 58
so, how do we judge whether the claims that are made or the information that’s passed on by organic food companies crosses this line into misinformation or materially misleading information, which is a standard in the ftc guidelines? %$* 58
what the government says-- %$* 58
now, think about the last time you went to the supermarket. %$* 58
you can’t walk down any aisle without leading labels that say they have reduced this or low that or a good source of this or promotes heart health or promotes eye health or good for your cholesterol, heart healthy, etc. %$* 58
all of these claims that either promote a food product because there’s more of something that’s good or less of something that’s not good for you, like saturated fat or cholesterol or salt, embedded in those claims are at least a 25 percent difference in the level of the nutrient. %$* 58
this is applied fairly universally across the entire food system. %$* 58
so, whenever you see these labels that says it’s, you know, a good source of lycopene-- %$* 58
you’re buying a tomato product; lycopene is a nutrient in tomatoes-- %$* 58
and it says a good source of lycopene, you can trust that the company has done testing that shows that there’s at least 25 percent more in their product compared to others. %$* 58
so, as we go through the evening, keep in mind that if there is solid scientific evidence that one food product, whether it’s conventional or organic, has higher or lower of a particular nutrient that’s good or bad for you buy a good or bad for you, by a 25% margin that the government allows a labeling claim to be associated with that. %$* 58
now, how is organic food marketed? %$* 58
what are the principle claims? %$* 58
and benefits? %$* 58
well, number one, of course, is organic farmers may not apply toxic synthetic pesticides. %$* 58
it's just a blanket prohibition. %$* 58
the products that they can apply encompass all of those that post any risk to humans or the environment. %$* 58
it's true organic farmers request use natural products like copper fungicides, sulfur is used to help protect diseases. %$* 58
natural insecticide, bacilus thuringiensis that blake talked about, it's how monsanto and other biotech companies have found a way to move the capacity to produce this natural insecticide into the corn plants. %$* 58
and so without a doubt the reduction in exposure and risk from pesticides is the most common claim that you read. %$* 58
and there is no question that organic farming reduces pesticide risk. %$* 58
it's laughable for anybody to argue that it doesn't. %$* 58
you know, american agriculture, apply rounds, a billion pounds of pesticides a year. %$* 58
some are not terribly hazardous, including glyfosate which blake will use on some of his genetically engineered crops. %$* 58
but there are several other pesticides, especially insecticides to do pose significant risk. %$* 58
and the fact that we're all exposed to pesticides, even before we're born, does play a role in our public health. %$* 58
do you all know that the average baby born in america has like 200 chemicals in its blood the moment it’s born from the exposures to its mother? %$* 58
about one out of eight babies are born with a diagnosable birth defect? %$* 58
about a quarter of the couples in america are having trouble having babies. %$* 58
they need some help in getting pregnant and carrying a pregnancy to term. %$* 58
the scientific literature is loaded with thousands of papers that demonstrate a connection between exposure to pesticides and these adverse health outcomes. %$* 58
to say that there are no risks for pesticides and no evidence, i mean if you don't-- %$* 58
if you don't believe in science, fine. %$* 58
go ahead and make that statement. %$* 58
but you can't claim that you read the scientific literature. %$* 58
that-- %$* 58
you know, it's just the way it is. %$* 58
another of the major claims that are made, and marketed, if you're shopping in the livestock part of the aisle, in the dairy or eggs or beef, livestock and organic farms have to be given ample space to carry out natural behaviors. %$* 58

i would like you to comment on the status of the dollar today, please? %$* 10
why me— %$* 373
i think it’s off our point too much. %$* 13
gentlemen, two in, three in—? %$* 13
gray jacket. %$* 13
hi, i hope i don’t ramble, i just thought about this, while you’re talking— %$* 9
“obama’s economic polices are working effectively” you better not ramble. %$* 13
i’ll try to make this in two minutes and the past few days— %$* 9
but you’ve already used 19 seconds. %$* 13
okay. %$* 9
we’ve talked about how there’s some systemic issues out there, we’ve talked about, you know, um, the finance instruments out there, the financial sector. %$* 9
we talked peripherally about how the american consumer is consuming too much and i think that’s pretty much a—i think that’s an issue that’s been going on for decades where the— %$* 9
okay, sir, i—please get to a question— %$* 13
my question is that, do you think there is a systematic issue that has been built because of the inequality of wealth out there where the 1 percent, who, basically control the market, there has never been a capitalist market, it’s the 1 percent that controls the market, there’s no transparency, do you think, there’s a big issue because there’s been a massive %$* 9
there’s a massive inequality in wealth distribution in this country and that’s going to create issues. %$* 9
“obama’s economic polices are working effectively” %$* 9
jamie galbraith. %$* 13
it bears very closely to the question of ineffective economic policy. %$* 370
if you try to have the economy recovery by shoring up those few at the top it simply isn’t going to work, it didn’t work in 1929, it’s not going to work now. %$* 370
what you have to do is to have a program which effectively provides employment, income, and security to the entire population of the united states. %$* 370
that’s where you need to begin. %$* 370
going about it the other way is simply going about it backwards, and doomed not to succeed. %$* 370
right, can i weigh in on this? %$* 371
yes, larry mishel. %$* 13
i absolutely think that the massive inequalities in our nation, were the precondition for the crisis that we’re in right now. %$* 371
and i believe that the obama administration’s plans actually do address many of the issues, not all the issues going forward, to try to resolve that. %$* 371
part of it is to develop a productive economy based on a non-carbon-based economy, part of it is to address changes in our basic labor markets, to have enforced labor laws “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” and the basic wage and hours type things, to be able to restore the right to have unions, to raise the minimum wage. %$* 371
we are, they are also pursuing having universal health care, which is a mechanism for distributing income throughout the population, and security, and to try to do they can to try to get unemployment down as fast as they can which i think is in fact what the policy is. %$* 371
so i think that moving forward, building an economy where we’re not having growth based on asset bubbles and consumer debt, is really important, and that the only way to do that is to have wages growing in line with productivity, and to have more economic security, and i think that if mr. %$* 371
mccain had been elected we would be nowhere on that agenda. %$* 371
with mr. %$* 371
obama, i think we’re around 75 percent on the right track towards that agenda— %$* 371
all right. %$* 13
ma’am, i—you used the question about the dollar, and i think i was too abrupt, and i apologize. %$* 13
was your question, looking at the dollar today, is it an indicator of his success, is that what you were getting at— %$* 13
yes, exactly, that’s why i wanted one of the gentlemen on the panel on the left to answer— %$* 10
well you’re back in, and i’m sorry— “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” %$* 13
okay— %$* 10
—about before %$* 13
well, uh— %$* 8
well, let me put in mark zandi, take that. %$* 13
well, i think the decline in the dollar that we’ve observed recently over the last six to nine months is entirely appropriate, and actually it’s been very orderly. %$* 17
entirely appropriate and a net positive for our economy, at least so far, that, yes, it has resulted in somewhat higher commodity prices in the one commodity that matters the most-- %$* 17
is the price of oil for all of us. %$* 17
but that negative has been offset by an increase in exports. %$* 17
a source of growth in our economy. %$* 17
it was a very significant negative back in the free fall, a year ago, nine months ago, but is now growing again in part because of the better global economy, in part because of the weaker dollar. %$* 17
also it’s helped corporate profits, a lot of companies that operate overseas are benefiting from the dollar, so it’s a net positive, now, i do think if you look further out, and the dollar begins to decline in a disorderly way for whatever reason, that would be a problem, but so far, no “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” problem, very good. %$* 17
james galbraith. %$* 13
very briefly, i’m not a deficit cassandra, i’m not a public debt cassandra and i’m not a dollar cassandra. %$* 370
these issues are often used to make the argument that you simply can’t do what needs to be done in order to bring the economy back on track and overcome our unemployment crisis. %$* 370
and i don’t think they are valid objections. %$* 370
so from that point of view actually mark and i don’t have an analytical difference, i would just simply say that the dollar will go where it’s going to go. %$* 370
it’s not going—the international monetary system will probably not collapse, and certainly not as the result of an effective effort to restore the american economy. %$* 370
gentleman in the center? %$* 13
yes. %$* 9
i think very few people here would disagree that there’s more that should be done, in terms of correcting the systemic problems that exist in this country. %$* 9
the question before the group though, is whether obama’s policies are working effectively. %$* 9
which brings us back to the problem of dealing with congress. %$* 9
where you have many people, when you talk about, “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” you know, making more green jobs, you have many people in congress, far too many who deny that global warming is even a problem. %$* 9
we have people who are in congress— %$* 9
i need you get to a question now. %$* 13
the question is, what would the panelists do, to try to implement the change that they’re talking about, dealing with the congress we presently have. %$* 9
steve—steve rattner, you described what passed is almost a miracle because of the congress— because of congress and because of— %$* 13
i’m sorry, what was it— %$* 32
you described the fact that the stimulus package passed as— %$* 13
yeah, it was almost a miracle— %$* 373
—as itself, a rare miracle. %$* 13
i think this is in all seriousness a huge issue for the country to think about, and, you know, there’s this great quote of jefferson’s “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” where he says if i had to choose between a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government, i would choose newspapers without a government. %$* 373
and i say that not because i’m advocating newspapers but, the whole concept when you get to washington of realizing what jefferson had in mind when he designed or was part of designing our system, the capitol’s on the hill, the white house is down at the bottom. %$* 373
article i of the constitution is the congress, it’s not the executive branch. %$* 373
the power that the congress has is formidable and it was created in an era where we weren’t going to be dealing with toxic assets and we weren’t going to be dealing with regulatory reform, and we weren’t going to be dealing with green jobs, and it’s a real problem, i think as i’ve tried to argue that i think president obama has done as effective a job as humanly possible in promoting a responsible agenda through congress. %$* 373
but if you take something like reg reform—financial regulatory reform, not to use the jargon, it is mired in a series of intra-congressional jurisdictional disputes over who would be in charge of this agency or that agency if you happen to pass something. %$* 373
it is a very broken system. %$* 373
eliot spitzer. %$* 13
yeah, see steve, we agree about the merits or demerits of “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” legislative branches, i think we would agree on that point clearly. %$* 374
having said that %$* 374
having said that, the question is what role does the executive play in defining the parameters of the debate. %$* 374
when it comes to regulatory reform as it relates to financial services, the president did not strike a position, did not articulate a position that said very clearly, here’s where we must go, which is what fdr did. %$* 374
fdr rewrote the rulebook, this president unfortunately embraced the existing rule structure, moved jurisdiction around marginally without saying the fundamental predicate of the issue, too big to fail, must shift. %$* 374
he hasn’t yet done. %$* 374
let me switch gears since you raised the metaphor of albany. %$* 374
when we went to albany, i did in fact on health care, fundamentally go to war with the entrenched interests about how health care would be delivered. %$* 374
we had an enormous battle, and we bent that curve in a very significant way. %$* 374
you can do it, it’s a question of articulating, drawing lines in the sand, you won’t win everything. %$* 374
the president has been admirable in many respects, but when it came to financial services in particular, he did not embrace the fundamental change that was needed. %$* 374
there’s a gentle— can you be brief, allan? %$* 13
please. %$* 372
“obama’s economic polices are working effectively” %$* 372
very brief. %$* 13
leadership consists of getting people to do the things that they don’t want to do. %$* 372
it doesn’t consist of blaming the congress, and blaming past administrations, for problems that were there, when you came in. %$* 372
gentleman with the yellow shirt in the dead center of the room. %$* 13
larry touched on this earlier, it would seem to me that, if you’re talking about obama’s policies, you have to talk about not only the legislation that has been passed, but what is proposed. %$* 9
small bus—and that would be including health care which is being debated now. %$* 9
cap-and-trade legislation, the expiration of the tax cuts, the bush tax cuts, and labor law changes including, a card check, and %$* 9
the way you would adjudicate disputes between labor and management. %$* 9
small business is going to— %$* 9
yeah, i need you to ask a question, sir. %$* 13
does anybody think this is going to have any impact, the overhang of these things on the creation of jobs going forward? %$* 9
“obama’s economic polices are working effectively” the uncertainties created and the costs involved? %$* 9
larry mishel. %$* 13
well, i think that these kinds of policies are exactly what’s needed to build the economy we need to come out of this recovery. %$* 371
we need an economy which provides broadly shared prosperity, this is something that we haven’t had in 30 years. %$* 371
prior to 2007 the prior 20 years or so, some 56 percent of all the income gains went to the upper 1 percent. %$* 371
that is not acceptable. %$* 371
it is also the predicate to the kind of crisis that we’ve had, because we can only have a robustly growing economy that’s sustainable if people are able to earn good wages and be able to spend based on those wages without going into debt or relying on asset bubbles. %$* 371
so i do think small business ideology says that these are not going to be good for them, but in fact it will be good for them, because it’s going to create a robust consumer economy that’s going to create a lot of different jobs, and that’s going to start benefiting everybody for once and for all. %$* 371
jamie galbraith. %$* 13
well %$* 370
i support health care reform, i support a strong energy and climate program, i support financial reform considerably stronger “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” than the administration is proposing. %$* 370
i don’t think anybody argues, i don’t think the president argues, that those three things amount to an economic recovery program, sufficient to create let’s say three million jobs a year over five years, that’s not even close. %$* 370
that’s the issue that’s before us, have we done enough, are we doing enough to deal with the problem, that the population of the united states faces, answer to that question is, no. %$* 370
eliott spitzer— %$* 13
i would just add very quickly one footnote to that, it’s perhaps not a footnote, credit to small business is where we are stumbling most dramatically. %$* 374
you cannot get loans if you’re a small business owner or entrepreneur. %$* 374
the reason for that is that all the capital went to the megabanks, and what they’re doing with it does not permit small businesses to grow. %$* 374
that is the egregious macro-error that the administration’s making. %$* 374
and the concludes round 2 of our debate. %$* 13
and here’s where we are, we are about to hear brief closing statements from each debater, two minutes each, and it’s their last chance to change your minds, and as we’ve said all along this is a debate of persuasion, you have been asked to vote “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” before the debate began and you’ll be asked to vote again after the debate, the team that changes the most minds will be declared the winner and to remind you of the results of the preliminary vote, our motion is “obama’s economic policies are working effectively,” 32 percent of you are for this motion, 29 percent of you are against, and 39 percent are undecided. %$* 13
you’ll be asked to vote one more time, and that will decide our winner just a few minutes from now. %$* 13
but first, round 3, closing statements, we’re going to begin with jamie galbraith, james galbraith, economist and professor of government and business relations at the university of texas at austin’s school of public affairs. %$* 13
our side in this debate has presented an emphatic call for action. %$* 370
the other side has asked you to accept excuses. %$* 370
excuses for the inadequacy of action so far. %$* 370
maybe a little unfair but i know that tomorrow morning the economic policy institute is going to issue with a broad coalition a major call for action. %$* 370
it’s exactly what we need, to deal with the gap in action today. %$* 370
yes, the congress is an obstacle. %$* 370
i worked for the congress for 10 years, i know how difficult it can be. %$* 370
i was there though, in 1981 when ronald reagan rolled the congress, and i would like to see once in my professional life, once in my life, for someone on our side to do the same. %$* 370
this is a dangerous moment. %$* 370
“obama’s economic polices are working effectively” the cost of inadequacy is extremely high. %$* 370
if the program falls short, then the political situation, the political momentum, will be lost. %$* 370
if people see results for the bankers, and not for themselves %$* 370
they see recovery in the stock market, but not in the value of their homes, they will turn away from all sensible measures. %$* 370
it will discredit everything the administration is in fact trying to do. %$* 370
can you err by doing too much, the prospect is extremely remote and if you did you could always pull back. %$* 370
it’s exactly the kind of boldness that is needed, to confront the situation that we do not have yet and that we could only hope will develop in the next stage of policy of this administration. %$* 370
thank you, james galbraith. %$* 13
summarizing for our motion, “obama’s economic policies are working effectively,” summarizing for this motion, mark zandi, chief economist and co-founder of moody’s economy.com. %$* 13
yeah, you know, to me, i think people lose sight of the severity of the situation that we’ve been in, the crisis that we’ve just gone through. %$* 17
the panic and the great recession, it truly, it is the longest deepest, broadest-based recession since the great depression, there’s no-- %$* 17
all the statistics are very clear on that. %$* 17
and i think the administration has been thrust into this, in the middle of it, and has been all about trying to bring an end to that “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” crisis, to quell the crisis, to quell the panic, to bring an end to the great recession, and here we are, you know, nine months into this administration, and look. %$* 17
the panic has been quelled. %$* 17
we’re still nervous, we’re still cautious. %$* 17
we haven’t gotten our groove back. %$* 17
but, just think where we were, the great recession is over. %$* 17
the great recession is over, yes, it’s not fully engaged. %$* 17
businesses went through near-death experiences, they’re not going to forget that and step out and start hiring immediately, you know. %$* 17
policy isn’t magic. %$* 17
it’s not magic. %$* 17
but the recession is over and we’re moving in the right direction. %$* 17
now. %$* 17
it’s fair to say that we need to do more. %$* 17
absolutely. %$* 17
you know, but the proposition is, are the obama administration’s economic policies working effectively, working. %$* 17
no one’s saying they’ve worked, that we’re done, that this is a work in progress, that the script hasn’t been written, and the administration as got a range of policies that it’s put forward, tough policies on difficult issues, things that we hadn’t been able to address, health care, financial regulatory reform, energy policy, tax reform, a budget deficit that’s been a problem for many, many years, and look, we’re starting to discuss it and that to me is proof positive that, they are working and we’re working in the right direction. %$* 17
thank you. %$* 17
good—thank you, mark zandi. %$* 13
making his “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” summary statement against the motion, allan meltzer, university professor of political economy at carnegie mellon. %$* 13
the subject is, are we %$* 372
working, is this administration’s program working. %$* 372
the forecasts for the future, this is the 12th i think recession in the post-war years. %$* 372
we recovered from most of them. %$* 372
most forecasts for the future say, the unemployment rate is going to stay up in the 10 to 11 percent range for a couple of years now. %$* 372
that’s not what i call working. %$* 372
the banking system, the financial structure, is unreformed. %$* 372
in addition to that, something we haven’t talked about, the administration has made threatening moves in the trade area. %$* 372
the world trade organization produced the greatest growth in world history, more people, in more countries, had their living standards raised by larger amounts in the post-war years, than at any time in mankind’s recorded history. %$* 372
they did that by reducing tariffs. %$* 372
the administration has increased tariffs on tires, steel pipes, next coming, coated papers, and other items. %$* 372
china is retaliating, by putting restrictions on auto imports. %$* 372
that’s a disaster. %$* 372
a bad policy. %$* 372
not a policy that is going to produce growth in jobs and improvements in the united states. %$* 372
it’s a policy which is going to make the world poorer. %$* 372
“obama’s economic polices are working effectively” and, summarizing for the motion, “obama’s economic policies are working effectively,” larry mishel, president of the economic policy institute. %$* 13
if the future is grim %$* 371
and i agree with allan meltzer that in fact there is going to be persistently high unemployment, that’s unacceptable. %$* 371
is that the obama’s administration fault? %$* 371
is that the fault of the kind of policies that actually allan himself and conservative allies have advocated for many different years. %$* 371
to my liberal friends %$* 371
what— i’ve said that there was an apartment building on fire, and eliot says, well maybe there were some fire trucks in the next county that could’ve actually helped put out the fire, in fact, i can tell you that he hasn’t named any other county which had the fire trucks, and what they would do, or said how they would get around the roadblock of the republican moderates in the senate that actually blocked an even more effective stimulus that was actually on the table. %$* 371
in my view, there’s been, and i have not been an obama supporter from day one of that campaign, i’m far from in the bag for the obama administration, i’m to the left of the obama administration, okay? %$* 371
i’ve been surprisingly pleased, much more pleased than i ever thought i would be by the direction of what they did with the recovery plan, “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” much larger, well-designed in terms of putting out some money early that got things going. %$* 371
some back-end public investments for energy alternatives, infrastructure, science, training, education, et cetera, i think very well-designed and smart. %$* 371
a lot of their other policies are directly on target, they’re trying to do big, bold things. %$* 371
i’m quite surprised and quite pleased, you should be as well. %$* 371
summarizing against the motion, eliot spitzer, former governor and attorney general of new york. %$* 13
well first of all, thank you all, this has been spirited fun and we probably disagree less than some of the rhetoric tonight would suggest but let me say this, i’m tired of hearing blame pushed to republicans in congress. %$* 374
we as democrats have a majority in both houses, it’s about time we used them. %$* 374
it’s about time we stood up and used our majority. %$* 374
it can be done, and we should do it. %$* 374
let me tell you where the fire trucks are, the fire trucks are the billions, hundreds of billions of dollars that were given to the wrong banks for the wrong reasons, that were not used to invest in the infrastructure, to invest in jobs, in mortgage reformation. %$* 374
that could’ve had a fundamental effect on our economy and that’s what we should have done. %$* 374
the fire “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” trucks take the form of not demanding reform of those who received the money. %$* 374
not making them pay for the benefit of receiving tax dollars in return for a reformed regulatory structure, and the fire trucks take the form of not investing in jobs for the future. %$* 374
i am worried, i think mark is exactly right. %$* 374
some of the nervousness is gone. %$* 374
the nervousness is gone primarily because of what the bush administration did, pushing a lot of money to the banks. %$* 374
that wasn’t the obama administration. %$* 374
but precisely because the nervousness is gone, the moment for the fundamental reform we need is passing. %$* 374
and rather than galvanize that urge for reform, rather than push for the fundamental reform that we need in terms of jobs, investing in education, investing in health care, driving up the average wages of workers, the administration is reinvesting in the status quo, primarily a financial services sector, based upon the incorrect but maybe it’s a benign interpretation, the incorrect belief that putting the money there will generate the jobs. %$* 374
as i said, those manufacturing jobs will not come back, general motors today said, they don’t anticipate hiring more workers in the united states. %$* 374
overseas they will. %$* 374
so yes, steve, we agree, we needed a bailout, but that’s not where jobs are coming from, jobs will come from small-medium business, banks should lend to them but the banks that would lend to them don’t have the capital, because all the capital went to the megabanks that are not going to lend to “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” them anyway. %$* 374
that was the critical mistake. %$* 374
thank you all for being here. %$* 374
finally summarizing for the motion, steve rattner, who led the administration’s efforts to restructure the auto industry. %$* 13
so eliot, let me see if i have this right, the mistake we made was quenching the fires of financial crisis which took away the urgency to do anything about it so we should restore the financial crisis so there is some desire to do something about it, is that right? %$* 373
use it properly. %$* 374
a crisis is a terrible thing to waste— %$* 374
my— wait a minute, wait a minute, i— %$* 373
that is really against the rules— %$* 13
this is my chance to— %$* 373
there is two minutes— %$* 13
—to have a last word without you saying anything. %$* 373
so i want to “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” say that the only systemic authority that the federal reserve would’ve had to bail out lehman brothers, would’ve been to bail out lehman brothers exactly what you don’t want to have happen, so there was no authority to deal with lehman brothers. %$* 373
one more comment to you before i leave you alone for a second, this idea that we have—and to jamie as well—the idea we have a majority in congress, yes, we have a majority in congress, it is very much in name only. %$* 373
we created, our political leaders, a big tent in order to have those majorities. %$* 373
that tent spans a lot of ideologies and it is very difficult to marshal majorities let alone the 60 votes you need in the senate where there are two independents, to get something done, and you guys make it sound easy, it is not, it is not easy, you make everything sound easy, you tell us— you know, just wave your magic wand and you’ll have financial regulatory reform, it’s not that easy. %$* 373
you’ve also set up a false dichotomy, you’ve said that, you’ve raised this question of whether or not we should have more action, of course we should have more action, we all agree that we should have more action. %$* 373
the question is, what is responsible, how do you get it done, and what makes good sense. %$* 373
and i would argue what i said before, i won’t repeat it all, that this administration’s put forward responsible policies in every area. %$* 373
is financial regulatory reform is it what i would do or what eliot would do, left to our own designs, no. %$* 373
but is it something “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” that they spent a lot of time vetting with congress people to try to come up with something that had a change of passage so that we would actually get something done as opposed to getting nothing done, it’s back to larry’s don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good. %$* 373
they did, and they have something out there, they have walked the walk, they’ve talked the talk. %$* 373
and what i frankly have heard tonight from the other panel, is, let’s just go do it and let’s pretend we’re at the aspen institute or the brookings institution, it’s just not how it works. %$* 373
this is my chance to— %$* 373
my— wait a minute, wait a minute, i— %$* 373
so eliot, let me see if i have this right, the mistake we made was quenching the fires of financial crisis which took away the urgency to do anything about it so we should restore the financial crisis so there is some desire to do something about it, is that right? %$* 373
and, that concludes closing statements for this debate. %$* 13
and now it’s time to learn which side argued best, who are our winners, we’re going to ask you one final time to go to the keypad on your seat, and vote. %$* 13

goodbye from intelligence squared us. %$* 13

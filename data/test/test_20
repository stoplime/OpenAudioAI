president bush bypasses congress to install his man at the u.n. %$* 116
so today i've used my constitutional authority to appoint john bolton to serve as america's ambassador in the united nations. %$* 161
today's move angers democrats. %$* 116
there will be a cloud over his head. %$* 557
but will there be repercussions? %$* 116
will the bolton appointment affect the supreme battle over john roberts? %$* 116
from cafta to energy to the highway bill, to renewing the patriot act and gun liability, it was a busy week for congress. %$* 116
we'll take a look at the winners and the losers in frantic flurry on capitol hill. %$* 116
and call it the battle of the books, the sequel. %$* 116
senator santorum challenges senator clinton to a war of words. %$* 116
plus, it's a big day for al gore. %$* 116
we'll tell you why. %$* 116
now, live from washington, cnn's inside politics. %$* 116
thanks for joining us. %$* 360
i'm joe johns. %$* 360
president bush today brought an abrupt end to the drawn-out debate over john bolton's nomination to be u.n. ambassador. %$* 360
he gave bolton a recess appointment, which gives bolton the job immediately, but only for a limited time. %$* 360
cnn white house correspondent suzanne malveaux has more on the president's decision and the reaction from bolton's opponents. %$* 360
expressing frustration and defiance, president bush was clear he had run out of patience. %$* 307
after a five-month impasse with senate democrats over his pick for u.n. ambassador, mr. bush sidestepped the senate to put john bolton in place. %$* 307
this post is too important to leave vacant any longer, especially during a war and a vital debate about u.n. reform. %$* 161
so today i have used my constitutional authority to appoint john bolton to serve as america's ambassador to the united nations. %$* 161
the recess appointment allows bolton to serve without the senate's approval until january 2007. %$* 307
the career diplomat made a brief and humble statement before taking the oath of office. %$* 307
and i am prepared to work tirelessly to carry out the agenda and initiatives that you and secretary rice direct. %$* 480
democrats, who accused bolton of abusing subordinates, manipulating intelligence, and browbeating critics, were furious. %$* 307
senator ted kennedy called it a devious maneuver that evades the constitutional requirement of senate consent and only further darkens the cloud over mr. bolton's credibility at the u.n. %$* 307
the democratic leadership called bolton "a seriously flawed and weakened candidate." %$* 307
but the white house insisted the democrats left mr. bush with no choice. %$* 307
it wasn't more documents that they wanted. %$* 314
they just wanted to play politics with his position. %$* 314
democrats and the white house deadlocked over intelligence records, which democrats believed would have shown whether bolton used his position to intimidate others. %$* 307
the chair of the senate foreign relations committee said after two hearings, 35 witnesses, and 1,000 pages of testimony, senators could not break the impasse. %$* 307
"although i would have preferred an up- or-down senate confirmation vote, the president's appointment was necessary." %$* 558
senate majority leader bill frist praised bolton as "a smart, principled and straightforward candidate." %$* 558
now, the battle over bolton, of course, crossed party lines. %$* 307
that is when senator george voinovich of ohio stepped in. %$* 307
that is when he, of course, split ranks with the other gop members, as well as the president. %$* 307
today he released his own statement, saying that he was disappointed in this recess appointment, in his words, saying that it will only add to bolton's baggage and his lack of credibility with the united nations. %$* 307
however, having said that, he said he would do everything in his power to move him forward and support him -- joe? %$* 307
suzanne, how do we expect this to affect the roberts' nomination? %$* 360
well, white house aides say that the president took that into account. %$* 307
the political calculus here was, is that roberts received such a warm reception on the hill that the president perhaps had a little bit more political capital to play with a little bit. %$* 307
they do not think that's it's going to have an impact on the roberts nomination. %$* 307
they believe they have enough support in the votes to push that through, and at the same time, to also push through with the bolton nomination. %$* 307
suzanne malveaux at the white house, thanks. %$* 360
presidents make recess appointments fairly often, but rarely for high-profile posts such as u.n. ambassador. %$* 360
cnn's bruce morton has more on the president's power to go around a sometimes reluctant senate. %$* 360
what is a recess appointment? %$* 321
it's an appointment the president makes while the senate is not in session -- is, in the phrase they use, in recess. %$* 321
they are on their summer break now, gone fishing or fundraising or whatever, but in recess. %$* 321
how long does the recess appointment last? %$* 321
until the end of the next full one-year session of congress. %$* 321
this is the first year of the 109th congress, so bolton's appointment would last until the end of the second session, december of 2006, or january of 2007, whenever they adjourn, or until the senate votes to confirm the recess appointee or a replacement. %$* 321
the constitution gives presidents this power. %$* 321
congressional sessions used to be a lot shorter than they are now, just a month or two each year. %$* 321
and presidents use this power. %$* 321
ronald reagan made 240 recess appointments during his eight years. %$* 321
bill clinton, 140 in his. %$* 321
famous recess appointments -- well, some fairly famous ones. %$* 321
this president named otto reich, assistant secretary of state for the western hemisphere. %$* 321
he was controversial because critics said he'd run a propaganda campaign against nicaragua's sandinista government, and in favor of the contra rebels there. %$* 321
he was never confirmed, and when his recess appointment expired, the president named a replacement. %$* 321
and mr. bush gave recess appointments to two controversial court of appeals judges, charles pickering and william pryor, though pryor was confirmed this past june. %$* 321
earl warren, william brennan, and potter stewart, who all three were subsequently confirmed by the senate. %$* 559
and in 1960, the democratic-controlled senate passed a resolution discouraging presidents from using recess appointments to fill supreme court vacancies. %$* 559
: how long must a recess be for a president to make a recess appointment? %$* 559
the constitution doesn't say. %$* 559
theodore roosevelt made some once, when the senate had been out less than a day. %$* 559
but in the last 20 years, the shortest recess in which a president has made a recess appointment was 10 days. %$* 559
bruce morton, cnn, washington. %$* 559
joining me now to talk more about the appointment -- john bolton's appointment to the u.n. is dan balz of the "washington post." %$* 360
he joins us from the "post" newsroom. %$* 360
dan, thanks for being here. %$* 360
do you see any lasting fallout from what the president did today? %$* 360
it's hard to tell at this point, joe, whether there will be lasting fallout. %$* 237
it certainly inflames an already-inflamed situation between the senate democrats and the white house. %$* 237
how much farther it goes from that, we won't know, but we'll probably get some early indication on how the roberts nomination and confirmation process go forward. %$* 237
is it likely that we will have some type of impact there, at least some hard feelings, some ill-will among certain senators? %$* 360
certainly at a minimum, we've got that. %$* 237
we've already had it. %$* 237
this bolton nomination was so controversial, both sides were so dug in, i think that it was clear what the president was going to do today. %$* 237
the only question was timing. %$* 237
but having done it, it raises the temperature quite a lot. %$* 237
i think the other thing that's important to remember is that part of the strategy that the democrats intend to use, with regard to the roberts nomination, is to ask for a significant number of documents, which they have done. %$* 237
they put out a request on friday for documents relating to his days as deputy solicitor general, covering a number of specific areas. %$* 237
they had asked for documents on the bolton thing; they were denied that. %$* 237
it's likely that the administration will deny them these documents. %$* 237
this could send them into that kind of cycle of retribution. %$* 237
again, how far they're willing to carry it is a different question. %$* 237
do you think the battle over documents is something that reaches out into the country and gets the attention of the voters? %$* 360
it's hard to tell that it does. %$* 237
i don't think that for a lot of people, the debate over documents is the crucial issue. %$* 237
but if it looks as though somebody is trying to hide something, that can play more broadly. %$* 237
so the question is, how the roberts confirmation process may or may not differ from what has happened in the bolton situation. %$* 237
is this something of a warning shot, do you think, from the president of the united states? %$* 360
we saw just a little -- a moment ago, in the bruce morton piece, that dwight eisenhower actually named some supreme court justices this very same way. %$* 360
i don't think there's any intention to name a supreme court justice by recess appointment. %$* 237
i also think that the administration feels confident at this point that they will get roberts through without a filibuster. %$* 237
if that were to change, we would have a different set of stakes. %$* 237
but i think that the idea of a recess appointment for a supreme court justice is very far down the line. %$* 237
johns: is there anything so far that you're seeing in the roberts record that could create a stir, or could create a fight in september? %$* 237
well, there are a number of issues that the democrats want to inquire more deeply on. %$* 237
one, obviously, is abortion. %$* 237
a second is civil rights. %$* 237
a third is the role of the federal government and its power versus the states. %$* 237
there are a bunch of areas that are likely to be the focus of questions and debate. %$* 237
again, it's not clear that there are enough senators on the democratic side who are prepared to vote against him, to block him, at this point. %$* 237
it certainly doesn't appear that way, but there may still be things that we don't know. %$* 237
the more documents that come out, the more we learn about him. %$* 237
the more we learn that he certainly does have a conservative philosophy. %$* 237
whether any of that is likely to stop him from being confirmed, i don't know. %$* 237
dan balz, "washington post," thanks so much for talking with us. %$* 360
thanks, joe. %$* 237
much more on the john bolton nomination ahead on inside politics. %$* 360
i'll talk with a bolton supporter and frequent critic, norm coleman, the republican senator from minnesota. %$* 360
nothing gets congress moving like an impending recess. %$* 360
we'll check the winner's list in the flurry of votes at the end of last week. %$* 360
and later, the next confirmation battle looming in washington, how the showdown over bolton could be just a preview of the battle over john roberts. %$* 360
joining us now with his take on president bush's controversial recess appointment of john bolton as ambassador to the united nations, republican senator norm coleman of minnesota. %$* 360
senator coleman is a member of the senate foreign relations committee. %$* 360
senator, thanks so much for joining us. %$* 360
it's great to be here, joe. %$* 560
what's your take -- what is your take on this recess appointment today? %$* 360
my take, it's another day in washington. %$* 560
but the bottom line is that there'll be a major conference on u.n. reform on september 14th to 16th. %$* 560
the president of the united states will address that conference. %$* 560
we haven't had a permanent ambassador for six months. %$* 560
the president needed to have somebody there. %$* 560
john bolton is his guy. %$* 560
he has got the president's confidence. %$* 560
fifty-six u.s. %$* 560
senators voted to stop the debate on bolton. %$* 560
i think he would have gotten more votes for confirmation. %$* 560
so, the president has got his guy with him. %$* 560
he'll be by his side as they prepare for a major conference on u.n. reform. %$* 560
in the end, things are going to be measured by what happens at the u.n., not the procedural or political machinations that go on before that. %$* 560
a lot of people are saying while the president got his man, it came at a high price and that in fact, mr. bolton will be weak in there simply because he was not confirmed by the united states senate. %$* 360
do you think that's true? %$* 360
not at all. %$* 560
as you -- you had a great piece on the history of recess appointments. %$* 560
supreme court justices -- earl warren being appointed, ambassadors, assistant attorney generals, etc. %$* 560
etc. %$* 560
bolton is going to be, you know, the permanent ambassador to the united nations for the united states of america. %$* 560
the president appointed him. %$* 560
as i said before, this is a guy that did have majority support in the united states senate. %$* 560
in most countries, having majority support would probably get you through -- through the procedural blocks that the other side put up. %$* 560
it didn't happen here, but i don't put any credence into the claim that somehow he'll be less effective or weakened. %$* 560
and john bolton is not a guy to be weakened, by the way. %$* 560
he's a strong voice. %$* 560
that's what the president wanted. %$* 560
that's what the america needs right now. %$* 560
what do you think went wrong on this nomination? %$* 360
why is it that democrats got their back up, so to speak? %$* 360
i don't know, joe, if you can look at it just in terms of the nomination itself. %$* 560
you know, if you look back at where we've been in the last year or two, we've had a number of appellate court justices, starting with miguel estrada and others, who simply couldn't get through. %$* 560
it wasn't until there was threat of employing a constitutional option that there was an agreement to get the judges through. %$* 560
we've reached a point, for whatever reason, where the partisanship is so tough in the united states senate that a minority of folks can block appointments. %$* 560
i think that's unhealthy. %$* 560
hopefully -- we'll see what happens with the roberts nomination, but hopefully we'll understand america doesn't want us to fight. %$* 560
they want us to get things done. %$* 560
as i said before, if bolton is a strong voice for u.s. reform and it happens, i think a majority of americans will be very pleased with what the president has done. %$* 560
how important was it to get this person in this place at this time? %$* 360
you know, there have been people for years who have suggested in washington, that the u.n. is pretty much irrelevant when it comes to the white house, anyway. %$* 360
i think the u.n., at times, has that perspective of irrelevant, but it went from irrelevant to outright mismanaged, perhaps corrupt. %$* 560
you had oil-for-food, you had sexual scandals, child prostitution rings by u.n. peacekeepers in africa, you had sexual harassment by highest-level u.n. officials that wasn't dealt with. %$* 560
so, it went from perhaps people not thinking about it, to being a terrible embarrassment. %$* 560
we fund 22 percent its operating budget, billions of taxpayer dollars at stake. %$* 560
and the president has said we're going to change that. %$* 560
and the u.n. understands. %$* 560
as a result of the oil-for-food investigations, that the world knows it needs to be reformed. %$* 560
so, this is an important moment and that's why it was so critical to have a permanent representative now -- to plan america's strategy, to work with the president, work with the u.n. and to begin to make change in an organization whose present structure, present type of management is simply not acceptable. %$* 560
will there be fallout, do you think, if you try to connect this to the coming confirmation battle over judge roberts? %$* 360
well, i think the fallout would be on the sides of -- on part of those who would try to make that connection. %$* 560
in the end, the president exercised a power that has been exercised 140 times by bill clinton, 240 times by ronald reagan. %$* 560
they have the power to make recess appointments. %$* 560
at the same time, we're going to come back in september and have a supreme court nomination that's going to be heavily scrutinized. %$* 560
but the president has picked someone, john roberts, who on the face of it right now, looks like he's going to get through. %$* 560
there doesn't seem to be a lot of questions about that. %$* 560
highly qualified; there's not an argument about that. %$* 560
and so, i think these will be separate issues. %$* 560
what you're hearing now is news today, this monday. %$* 560
in september, when we're looking at the roberts nomination, i don't think are going to be talking about recess appointments. %$* 560
all right, then. %$* 360
thanks so much, senator coleman, for that. %$* 360
we will talk to you again soon. %$* 360
thank you. %$* 560
later in the show, we will hear the other side of this hot topic when i talk with democratic senator, chris dodd. %$* 360
coming up next, the mad dash on capitol hill. %$* 360
with the august recess in their sights, republican lawmakers delivered big victories to president bush before heading out of town. %$* 360
we'll bring you a scorecard. %$* 360
it was the annual mad dash on capitol hill, a frenzy of voting in the last days before the august recess. %$* 360
this year, president bush was the big winner, but he wasn't the only one. %$* 360
a big victory for the national rifle association rounded out the congressional race to the august recess, with senate approval of a bill to protect gun manufacturers and dealers from lawsuits filed by people injured by their products. %$* 370
if the gun industry is forced into bankruptcy, the right to keep and bear arms will be a right in name only. %$* 507
senator frist is hell-bent on helping the gun industry. %$* 561
and he's got to do it this week. %$* 561
this is his summer gift to a special interest group. %$* 561
the senate also passed a bill that would make permanent many of the government powers to investigate terrorism that are about to expire in the usa patriot act. %$* 360
that bill passed on a voice vote with no debate. %$* 360
civil libertarians claimed they were able to get some new safeguards included. %$* 360
it was the end of a brisk week on capitol hill, a string of victories for the president and the republican-controlled congress. %$* 360
this has been the most productive first session of a congress that we've had in the senate since probably the mid-1990s. %$* 561
as a result of the july rush, two measures that were stalled for years are now headed to the president's desk, an energy bill and a transportation bill. %$* 360
the house also approved cafta, the central american free trade agreement. %$* 360
it was a week that left senate democrats grumbling about what did not get done, and accusing the gop leadership of cramming all the work into a few days because of time squandered in the fight earlier this year over federal judicial nominations. %$* 360
now, i recognize we've wasted a lot of time in the senate, spending one-third -- one-third of the senate's time, on voting on three judges. %$* 298
so i know we're real cramped for time around here because of that. %$* 298
president bush sticking to his guns and defying the democrats. %$* 360
will the recess appointment of john bolton to the united nations affect the nomination of john roberts to the supreme court? %$* 360
bill schneider joins us with that. %$* 360
also ahead, the first anti-roberts tv ad debuts, with his confirmation hearings still a month away. %$* 360
we'll be right back. %$* 360
as the markets get set to close on wall street, i am joined by kitty pilgrim in new york with "the dobbs report" -- kitty. %$* 360
hi, joe. %$* 315
ok, let's start with oil. %$* 315
and today, we have a big day in oil. %$* 315
we actually got above $62 a barrel, backed off a teeny bit, not much, $61.60. %$* 315
that, of course, following the death of saudi arabia's king fahd. %$* 315
saudi arabia controls a quarter of the world's oil supply, so that's why you have that. %$* 315
let's look at wall street. %$* 315
stocks mixed, dow industrials down 13, nasdaq half of 1 percent higher. %$* 315
also, end of gm's bargain basement prices, the so-called employee discount program. %$* 315
however, the company is cutting prices on 30 different models, in some cases by up to $4,800. %$* 315
ford keeping a good thing going, extending its employee discount plan until after labor day. %$* 315
in other news, the company responsible for the atkins diet declared itself bankrupt, says stiff competition is to blame. %$* 315
low-carb business diet never won over the experts. %$* 315
and it focused on fatty foods, and not fruits and vegetables. %$* 315
not going to make any points on that. %$* 315
00 p.m. eastern, lou dobbs tonight, iran says it will restart its nuclear processing unless europe sweetens the offer of incentives. %$* 483
tactically, hope burns eternal when it comes to diplomacy. %$* 562
there's always some wrinkle that hasn't been thought through. %$* 562
strategically, in the long run, though, we're in big trouble. %$* 562
and whether they break the seals this week or not, we had better start talking about what we're going to do when and if iran breaks this pledge not to make nuclear fuel. %$* 562
also tonight, a special report on the president's recess appointment of john bolton to the united nations. %$* 315
jed babbin, author of "inside the asylum," on why the u.n. and old europe are worse than you think. %$* 315
he thinks the president's appointment was the right thing to do. %$* 315
he'll be our guest. %$* 315
senator chris dodd of connecticut, vocal opponent of the bolton nomination, also joins us to discuss the move. %$* 315
plus, is global warming leading to powerful hurricanes? %$* 315
kerry emmanuel of m.i.t. %$* 315
-- he studies the ferocity of hurricanes. %$* 315
doctor chris landsea from noaa -- he questions the methodology. %$* 315
both of those men will be our guests and they'll debate it. %$* 315
00 eastern. %$* 501
please join us on lou dobbs tonight. %$* 501
for now, back to joe -- joe. %$* 501
thanks, kitty. %$* 360
now back to inside politics. %$* 360
the president's decision to give john bolton a recess appointment as u.n. ambassador has ended a big political standoff here in washington, but it may have increased the odds of an even bigger partisan showdown with much more at stake for both the president and his political opponents. %$* 360
our senior political analyst bill schneider has more on that. %$* 360
the political arms race in washington has just escalated. %$* 317
it was an in-your-face move by the president. %$* 563
president bush claims it was justified by democratic stalling. %$* 317
yet because of partisan delaying tactics by a handful of senators, john was unfairly denied the up-or-down vote that he deserves. %$* 161
for the time being, the bolton appointment will poison the political atmosphere. %$* 317
there will be unhappiness, anger. %$* 557
this democrat believes it may not last too long. %$* 317
ultimately, here in congress, we'll go on to the next topic. %$* 557
that's the problem. %$* 317
the next topic is john roberts' nomination to the supreme court, a parallel not lost on democrats. %$* 317
john bolton was nominated to be ambassador to the united nations. %$* 324
we requested documents to determine if he acted appropriately in his previous job, and we have been repeatedly denied. %$* 324
now john roberts has been nominated to a lifetime seat on the supreme court. %$* 324
we hope this nomination will be different, but press accounts suggest otherwise. %$* 324
roberts looked like a de-escalation of the political arms race, less of an in-your-face choice than others might have been, but recently released documents have heightened democrats' concerns over roberts. %$* 317
they want to see more documents from roberts' work in the administration of the first president bush, which the current white house has refused to turn over. %$* 317
democrats could dare to use the filibuster to block roberts' confirmation. %$* 317
republicans could then double-dare to use the dreaded nuclear option, which would end judicial filibusters. %$* 317
could president bush's recess appointment of bolton actually spin out of control like that? %$* 317
it's a very puzzling move, reflecting more, i think, the stubbornness of the chief executive, than any clear calculation of political benefits and costs. %$* 563
that's the way wars have sometimes started. %$* 317
thank goodness the cold war never reached the nuclear option. %$* 317
the political wars in washington may not either, if somebody can come up with an arms control plan. %$* 317
but do you have some sense that perhaps he's getting a little bit of extra wiggle room here, because this is foreign policy? %$* 360
yes, because this is international policy, where the president has always enjoyed a certain supremacy. %$* 317
i think there may be some tendency to say the president should get his man at the united nations. %$* 317
and, you know, another argument i've heard from democrats, some democrats have said, they said, you know, the u.n. needs some shaking up, and if john bolton can do it, even if we don't agree with him, maybe that will be a good thing. %$* 317
the question, though, is whether that shaking up is going to really be shaking up, given the fact that he doesn't have the support, the full support of the united states senate. %$* 360
well, that's the issue that a lot of democrats are raising, credibility. %$* 317
they say, how much credibility can he have if he is not confirmed by the united states senate? %$* 317
he'll go off to the u.n. and say, do this and do this and we demand reform. %$* 317
and perhaps some others in the u.n. will say, well, wait a minute. %$* 317
he may be the president's man, but he doesn't have the united states government authority behind him. %$* 317
thanks so much, bill schneider. %$* 360
sure. %$* 317
a short while ago, i discussed the bolton nomination and the appointment with one of bolton's toughest senate critics, democrat chris dodd of connecticut. %$* 360
i started by asking him for his reaction to the president's decision to sidestep senate confirmation. %$* 360
well, i'm not surprised. %$* 516
we had heard rumors for several days that the president would make a recess appointment of mr. bolton. %$* 516
i'm disappointed by it, i must tell you. %$* 516
this was more than just a small group in the senate that was opposed to this nomination. %$* 516
we had 45 votes against even extending -- limiting the debate, rather, on the bolton nomination, so this wasn't just a small number of people. %$* 516
and you compare that with over the last almost 50 years of nominations going to the united nations. %$* 516
there have been only been 19 votes against all former nominees to go to the u.n. %$* 516
here we have a nomination that had significant opposition to it going forward. %$* 516
now, you've called bolton damaged goods. %$* 360
how will his failure to get confirmation before the senate affect his ability to do his job at the united nations? %$* 360
well, we have a number of huge issues that need to be resolved. %$* 516
the top of the list is reform at the u.n. %$* 516
that means the united states has to build coalitions of member states to support the u.n. reform efforts that we're in favor of. %$* 516
i think it's very difficult to do that if you're coming out with only the endorsement of the president of the united states, you've been rejected by the senate of the united states. %$* 516
it almost appears that way. %$* 516
and i think that hurts your credibility. %$* 516
and, of course, there's serious questions that have been raised about mr. bolton and how he handled intelligence analysts, tried to fire two of them because he disagreed with their conclusions. %$* 516
he didn't like the recommendations they were making. %$* 516
you had -- the most damaging evidence against him came from 15 of the bush administration employees; 102 ambassadors, republicans and democrats, recommended against this nomination. %$* 516
the chief of staff of colin powell said this would be a terrible choice to the send to the u.n. %$* 516
this is a person who has serious credibility problems. %$* 516
you're sending him up at a critical time, iran, iraq, north korea, the middle east, afghanistan, reform issues. %$* 516
i think you're going to have an awfully difficult time with mr. bolton building the kind of support the united states needs today at the united nations. %$* 516
mr. bolton has been confirmed before as well, and many in the senate have suggested, particularly the republicans, that all of this is about politics. %$* 360
why did you personally push so hard to try to keep him from being confirmed? %$* 360
well, he did one thing particularly which i think disqualified him. %$* 516
and that was when he decided -- tried to fire two intelligence analysts because they made recommendations he disagreed with. %$* 516
he wanted to hear something else from the intelligence analysts. %$* 516
they wouldn't give him that information. %$* 516
they disagreed with it. %$* 516
now, you've said before on this program that you don't think a recess appointment would affect the calculation on the roberts nomination and his confirmation hearings coming up. %$* 249
do you want to amend that? %$* 249
are you certain of that? %$* 249
some of your democratic colleagues are suggesting there might be a link. %$* 249
well, there may be in some people's minds. %$* 516
and there's a pattern developing here, unfortunately, and that is where the white house is withholding important information to important senate committees considering these nominations. %$* 516
judge roberts seems like a good nominee, certainly credible. %$* 516
there is information the judiciary committee would like to have. %$* 516
remember, this is a lifetime appointment to the supreme court, the highest court of our land. %$* 516
they need some documentation to confirm or to question mr. -- judge roberts about. %$* 516
i think the white house ought to be helpful in that regard. %$* 516
that certainly was the problem here in the bolton nomination. %$* 516
senator biden wanted information about the allegation regarding weapon of mass destruction in syria. %$* 516
i wanted to see or have senior members of the senate see some of the intercepts that mr. bolton saw, the 19 names. %$* 516
the white house refused to share that information. %$* 516
and that was the reason why many people voted against the motion on cloture -- that is to limit debate on the bolton nomination. %$* 516
senator chris dodd. %$* 360
checking the "political bytes" this monday, a spokesman for new york governor pataki says pataki plans to veto legislation that would provide access to the so-called morning-after pill without a prescription. %$* 360
aides say the bill does not contain provisions that would keep the bill out of the hands of minors. %$* 360
critics accuse pataki of trying to appeal to his party's conservative wing as he considers a possible run for the white house. %$* 360
voters in ohio's heavily republican 2nd district head to the polls tomorrow for a special election. %$* 360
democrat paul hackett is trying to become the first iraq war veteran elected to congress. %$* 360
over the weekend, hackett campaigned with former senator john glenn, while the "cincinnati enquirer" endorsed his gop opponent, jean schmidt. %$* 360
baltimore orioles slugger rafael palmeiro has been suspended for 10 days by major league baseball for violating the league's steroid policy. %$* 360
palmeiro, you may recall, was among the most outspoken critics of steroid use when he appeared at a congressional hearing in march. %$* 360
a spokesman for the government reform committee, which held the steroid hearings, called today's news disheartening for those who consider palmeiro an ally in the battle against performance-enhancing drugs. %$* 360
several hours ago, palmeiro apologized and insisted he's never intentionally taken a banned substance. %$* 360
at the white house, the president's spokesman told cnn -- quote -- "the president considers him a friend and he believes him when he says he didn't use steroids." %$* 360
taking aim at president bush's pick for the supreme court. %$* 360
coming up, critics of john roberts take to the air in a bid to stop him from sitting on the nation's highest court. %$* 360
republican senator rick santorum challenges democratic colleague hillary clinton to a debate. %$* 360
that's just one of our hot topics in "strategy session" with donna brazile and rich galen. %$* 360
and our blog reporters are standing by with a look at how people online view president bush's recess appointment of john bolton as ambassador to the united nations. %$* 360
the fight over supreme court nominee john roberts is heating up, even before the start of his senate confirmation hearings next month. %$* 360
the first anti-roberts television ad kicked off yesterday, airing on national cable networks, with an initial buy of seven days, paid for by independentcourt.org. %$* 360
the ad calls on the white house to stop withholding important documents from senators on roberts' record. %$* 360
it also says americans have a right to know if roberts will protect their rights and freedoms. %$* 360
joining us now with their take on the ad and roberts' nomination, nan aron. %$* 360
she's in san francisco. %$* 360
and, in new york, wendy long of the judicial confirmation network. %$* 360
thanks so much, both of you, being here on opposite coasts. %$* 360
kicking it off here, i guess we're all talking here in washington about the bolton nomination, also his recess appointment now. %$* 360
do you think this changes the calculation in any way as we go into the confirmation hearings for judge roberts in september? %$* 360
i'm sorry. %$* 360
go ahead, wendy, first. %$* 360
i think, if anything, joe, it just -- it just strengthens the republicans' position and the president's position, shows that he's not going to back down and he's going to stand up for the people he believes in that the american people elected him to appoint. %$* 564
nan? %$* 360
well, it certainly is a bad signal, i think. %$* 565
john roberts is up for a supreme court seat, and he could be there, arguably, for decades to come. %$* 565
we're hoping and counting on this president to be forthcoming and to do what he wasn't willing to do in the bolton nomination, which is share information about roberts' record, so that the senate and american people can know where he stands on important issues. %$* 565
nan, do you think that gets through, that notion of documents and whether they were delivered or whether they were not? %$* 360
do the voters really care about that at the end? %$* 360
oh, you know, polls that we have conducted show that americans want the senate to take an independent role in the confirmation process. %$* 565
they don't want the senate to be a rubber stamp. %$* 565
and there's really no way for the senate to fulfill this important constitutional task ahead of it unless it's got the records and the documentation and relevant materials that tell the senate and us as americans who john roberts is and what he believes. %$* 565
you know, the white house knows... %$* 565
wendy, do you agree? %$* 360
it's incumbent on all of us to know. %$* 565
wendy, do you agree with that notion... %$* 360
no. %$* 564
well... %$* 564
... that these documents are going to really matter to voters? %$* 360
i don't agree that the contents of the 70,000 pages that have been released by the white house -- an unprecedented number of documents, by the way, that's never been released before for any other nominee -- no, i don't think americans care about what is in those documents, because you know what? %$* 564
it really isn't all that relevant. %$* 564
the most relevant thing about judge roberts are the rulings that he's made from the bench as a judge on the d.c. %$* 564
circuit, what's called the second highest court in the land. %$* 564
and i think those are the really important writings that show how he would behave as a judge or a justice on the supreme court. %$* 564
these documents that were released by the white house give a fuller picture of who he is. %$* 564
they certainly give lots of helpful background and senators and their staff are free to look at those and, i'm sure, ask questions about that. %$* 564
and, as i say, it's more information than has ever been released before about any nominee in the past. %$* 564
well... %$* 565
nan, one thing... %$* 360
this is just a fraction of the documents that exist about roberts' record. %$* 565
and they tell us what he thought when he was 26 years old. %$* 565
i think it's important for the nation to know what he believed when he worked for the bush administration after that. %$* 565
so, i think it's critically important for not just a small number of documents, but the full picture. %$* 565
each day brings... %$* 565
wendy, let me come back to you now. %$* 360
the one thing we got in the newspaper today was a question about how the judge, in his past life, of course, has handled civil rights issues. %$* 360
from your point of view, do you think that's something that sticks to him as a nominee? %$* 360
i sure hope it sticks, because his record on civil rights issue, principally, two things emerge. %$* 564
one is that he's a very principled person, a principled conservative, who believes in the idea of judicial restraint -- that is, not inventing things that are not in the constitution, but defending very strongly the rights and freedoms that are in the constitution. %$* 564
and the second thing is that he believes in the very core bedrock principle of equality for all americans. %$* 564
and that's what emerges from these papers. %$* 564
and so, i think that it is a wonderful thing to come out. %$* 564
and i think it is a reflection of what his views are. %$* 564
nan aron, what's your view on that? %$* 360
well, these documents show that he was at the very center of efforts during the reagan administration to revamp civil rights laws, our fair housing law, our voting rights law, seeking to overturn or weaken laws that people of color and women have taken for granted for decades. %$* 565
so, each day brings very disturbing revelations about his work in trying to turn the clock back on americans' protections, worker protections, women's protections. %$* 565
i think it's important for the american people and the senate to know more about this record, particularly given the concerns that have already been raised. %$* 565
i think what's clear from the record is that he opposed and laid bare the fallacy of failed policies, like bussing and racial quotas and racial preferences. %$* 564
that's what we're talking about. %$* 564
when nan refers to these nonspecific rights, it's really just a liberal policy agenda of those kinds of policies. %$* 564
now... %$* 360
no. %$* 565
one other thing that's interesting is, we all said before the nominee was even named that there would be this huge fight between groups such as yours. %$* 360
so far, that fight has not materialized. %$* 360
do you think it's still coming down the road, or do you think it's pretty much defused? %$* 360
well, i... %$* 566
sorry. %$* 564
go ahead. %$* 360
i think, at this point, his record on the d.c. %$* 565
circuit is very sparse, very scanty. %$* 565
we're not able to make a judgment overall about his entire record, but we continue to look at documents. %$* 565
and i should say that our concerns are only increasing about roberts' commitment to individual rights and freedoms. %$* 565
wendy? %$* 360
i think that it's very hard to attack somebody of unquestioned legal brilliance, personal integrity and judicial temperament. %$* 564
and when it's that hard to do, you start doing things like playing the race card and talking about your concerns about civil rights. %$* 564
and i think that that's what's happening now. %$* 564
thanks so much to both of you. %$* 360
and we will be in touch in the days ahead. %$* 360
thank you. %$* 565
thank you. %$* 564
kicking up a hornets' nest. %$* 360
bloggers are going wild over john bolton's end-run around democratic lawmakers to the united nations. %$* 360
we'll check in with our blog reporters next. %$* 360
as you may have guessed, john bolton's recess appointment as ambassador to the united nations is getting a lot of attention in the blogosphere. %$* 360
joining us with that, cnn political producer abbi tatton and jacki schechner, our blog reporter -- jacki. %$* 360
hi, joe. %$* 325
truly a mixed bag of reaction online. %$* 325
we start over on the right, the conservatives, powerlineblog.com. %$* 325
this is one of the biggies. %$* 325
they say that this is actually a good thing, that this was the right thing to do by president bush, that the senate democrats, through their overuse of the filibuster -- that being paul's words at powerlineblog -- have acted abusively. %$* 325
so, that's one reaction. %$* 325
we went over to captain's quarters, also another big conservative blog, saying they noticed that president bush didn't waste any time with the hiatus of putting bolton -- elevating bolton to this position, also noticing that president bush wanted two things, the fact that he doesn't have the confidence of congress, no big deal, that president bush wanted someone who was going to speak for him. %$* 325
he got that in bolton, and somebody who was going to be tough and really put up a fight. %$* 325
right. %$* 384
and there are other bloggers on the right looking ahead to what bolton might do at the united nations. %$* 384
roger l. simon, rogerlsimon.com, this is a screenwriter out in california who's also a political blogger and has written extensively about the united nations, focusing on the oil-for- food scandal that happened earlier this year that people were looking at. %$* 384
what he says is, people he knows that know bolton have told him that he's a nice guy. %$* 384
roger l. simon saying: "well, i hope he's not a nice guy. %$* 384
that's not what need at the united nations right now. %$* 384
what the united nations need is a solid blast of big-time rudeness," hoping that bolton can provide that. %$* 384
when we were talking about this last week, we noted that there were some conservative bloggers out there who really thought that this nominee was damaged, that it was time for the nominee to be withdrawn, not looking forward to a recess appointment. %$* 384
outside the beltway, james joyner in virginia wrote about that today. %$* 384
he calls it a big mistake. %$* 384
another one, dr. steven taylor, who writes at poliblogger.com, looking at this and saying, what we're hearing from the left as well, that bolton now goes to the united nations as damaged goods. %$* 384
will he be able to shake it up now that the world knows he didn't have the support of congress? %$* 384
maybe not. %$* 384
over at uncorrelated.com, another theme that we're seeing emanating from the right, how much does this really matter? %$* 325
is it the u.n. at the strength it needs to be? %$* 325
and is bolton really going to make any difference? %$* 325
that was greg's  particular point of view, that this is really not a big deal, going on to say the u.n. is not what it once was. %$* 325
now, over on the left, some of the opinion that we're seeing is something you might expect. %$* 325
peskyapostrophe.com calls this a sinking ship, saying they can't get all that worked up about it. %$* 325
this is exactly what they expected. %$* 325
it is going to be funny to see how it goes down, and funny in a sad way. %$* 325
and there wasn't a lot of support at all on the left for this nominee, but some on the left are saying, don't get -- this -- we haven't lost here. %$* 384
we shouldn't be giving up. %$* 384
we actually put up a good fight. %$* 384
thewashingtonnote.com, this is steve clemons' site. %$* 384
there are other people blogging here while steve is away. %$* 384
they have looked extensively at bolton through -- through this entire period. %$* 384
and what they're saying is, activists, senators and bloggers all got together to really fight against this nominee. %$* 384
and, in doing so, they thwarted what the white house thought was their omnipotence. %$* 384
don't give up, this is -- this bodes well for the future, is what they're saying. %$* 384
now, talking about the future of blogging, wanted to give a quick mention to a conference that took place out in california over the weekend. %$* 325
it was called blogher con -- h-e-r con -- and it was a conference of female bloggers. %$* 325
it was organized by three particular female bloggers and it drew a crowd, we're now hearing, of about 300 or so. %$* 325
and it wasn't primarily -- it was primarily women, rather, but not exclusively women, a great roundup, actually, at a male blog over at washingtonmonthly.com. %$* 325
this is kevin drumm's blog. %$* 325
also, you can get information through blogher.org, a lot of photographers, a lot of live links, a lot of chat transcripts, everything you can possibly do in a one-day conference -- joe, we'll send it back to you. %$* 325
abbi and jacki, thank you very much. %$* 360
the "strategy session" is straight ahead on inside politics. %$* 360
today, donna brazile and rich galen will be here to talk about president bush's recess appointment of john bolton and other big topics of the day. %$* 360
stay with us. %$* 360
welcome back to inside politics and our "strategy session" on today's hottest political topics. %$* 360
with us now, democratic strategist donna brazile and republican strategist rich galen. %$* 360
today, in a controversial move, president bush appoints john bolton as u.n. -- u.s. ambassador to the united nations. %$* 360
senator rick santorum challenges senate colleague hillary clinton to a debate. %$* 360
and al gore launches his new tv channel. %$* 360
first up, a move by the president that democrats are calling a devious maneuver, john bolton headed to the united nations after mr. bush appointed him ambassador earlier today. %$* 360
the united states senate held thorough confirmation hearings and a majority of the united states senators agree that he is the right man for the job. %$* 161
yet because of partisan delaying tactics by a handful of senators, john was unfairly denied the up-or-down vote that he deserves. %$* 161
rich galen, donna brazile, was this good strategy by the president? %$* 360
no, i don't think so. %$* 567
look, the president could have had an up-or-down vote had he cooperated with the senate and given democrats the documents that they requested. %$* 567
some democrats even believed that mr. bolton misled them on his form that he submitted earlier this year in terms of being investigated by the internal a.g. %$* 567
look, i think this was a bad move. %$* 567
yes, the president has every right. %$* 567
that's the power of the presidency to make recess appointments, but mr. bolton now arrives in new york with serious credibility weakened and damaged. %$* 567
rich? %$* 360
bill clinton did this a lot, too? %$* 360
yes, bill clinton in fact, did 140 -- 140 recess appointments. %$* 388
so, this isn't exactly odd. %$* 388
and he wasn't frankly out of line. %$* 388
this is what presidents do. %$* 388
but let me tell you something that i learned when i was overseas in iraq, from the senior state department guys. %$* 388
we have a -- we sort of -- here in washington sort of laugh and giggle at ambassadorial appointments that go to big fundraisers and what have you. %$* 388
but here's what a senior state department guy told me, that the receiving country really would rather have a political appointee than a, in most cases, than a state department senior foreign service officer. %$* 388
why? %$* 388
because if you're the country of upper uganda and you get a state department guy, then your -- his best friend is the upper ugandan desk officer. %$* 388
the fundraiser's best friend is the president of the united states. %$* 388
so, when bolton goes to the united nations, everybody else in that body knows that he is the president's guy, that in fact, the president went out on a limb for him and that he's going to be able to -- that when he speaks, he's speaking for the president. %$* 388
yes. %$* 567
but you need someone who can help, you know, the united states retain its good diplomatic relations. %$* 567
and from all reports, i mean, john bolton is not the guy to help restore america's credibility in the world, at a time when the u.n. is trying to reform itself? %$* 567
i mean, what is he bringing to the table? %$* 567
well, i don't think the u.n. is doing a good enough job in trying to reform itself, which i think is the basic problem. %$* 388
i mean, having john bolton there wagging his finger at -- here's -- and i think the administration made a mistake here. %$* 388
i think if the administration would have made it a choice between kofi annan and john bolton, this thing would have sailed through, but they never quite got to that point. %$* 388
now, we have a quote from senator kennedy. %$* 360
he's calling it "devious." %$* 360
that's where we got it from. %$* 360
can you show that quote? %$* 360
he says, "this further darkens the cloud over mr. bolton's credibility at the u.n." essentially, you know, he's saying there's no way this guy is going to be able to do well simply because of the way he got the job. %$* 360
well, the nature of recess appointments, as we all know, is that they last until the end of the congress, not until the beginning of the next one, but to the end of this coming -- this congress and it's not renewable. %$* 388
so either he does a good enough job to warrant confirmation, or he doesn't. %$* 388
the other question, of course, is how is this going to affect the roberts nomination? %$* 360
in just a month now, we're going to have the first supreme court nominee in 11 years to go before the senate judiciary committee. %$* 360
why make democratic senators mad at a time like this? %$* 360
well once again, i'm sure the democrats on capitol hill and some republicans, because after all, mr. voinovich and others had concerns about mr. bolton, they're requesting documents that should be in the public domain. %$* 567
i mean, the senate should have the opportunity to review all of mr. roberts' writings, those under president reagan as well as the documents under president george herbert walker bush. %$* 567
so, i would hope that the white house stops stonewalling the senate and gives up these documents so that  -- %$* 567
well... %$* 388
well, rich, that's what's happening. %$* 567
no, it's not. %$* 388
because they're requesting documents -- these are senators. %$* 567
this a co-equal branch of government. %$* 567
and they're requesting documents. %$* 567
this is not a witch hunt. %$* 567
there's not a single -- no. %$* 388
there's not a single lawyer in this town, republican or democrat, that i've spoken to that thinks that attorney work product is a -- is something that ought to be in the public domain. %$* 388
not a single attorney thinks that. %$* 388
when the client is... %$* 567
other than charles schumer, assuming that he's an attorney. %$* 388
... the united states government and the citizens of the united states, those documents should be turned over or give senators an opportunity to review the documents just to assess, you know, his views. %$* 567
look, what we've learned already based on the limited number of documents that's been released from the reagan archives and library is that he held very, very controversial views on one of the most important issues during reagan's tenure. %$* 567
that was the reauthorization of the voting rights act. %$* 567
so, i think it's important to see all of those documents, so that we get a full view of john roberts' thinking. %$* 567
it's an interesting thing that this is a little bit different than your side -- than the executive privilege argument that your side was making during the lewinsky scandal? %$* 388
i seem to remember you sort of liked the whole executive privilege...      johns: was he pushing a position as a lawyer would advocate a position, or were these his own personal beliefs? %$* 388
well, we haven't read the documents, as donna properly points out. %$* 388
but i will say, having read -- there was a piece in the "washington post" this morning that we all read here, but it seemed to me as i was reading that, that the argument he appeared to have been making -- and i might be wrong about this, but i -- it seemed to me the argument he was making was that the legal structure was in place for these things to be going forward. %$* 388
that now it's up to the legislative branch to do its job, that it was time to -- it wasn't like it was 1956. %$* 388
this is 1881, '82, '83. %$* 388
so, his position was that the legal structure had been put in place and it was time for the legislative branch to step up to the plate. %$* 388
donna, is there anything out there that democrats can lay a glove on him now with? %$* 360
i think there's a lot there already. %$* 567
but look, i think that first of all, the senate should do its homework. %$* 567
i mean, the president had time, four-and-half years, to review a host of candidates and he came up with this one and the most qualified. %$* 567
what democrats and republicans alike should do is to review his entire record. %$* 567
but from what i've seen on the environment, on civil rights, on workers rights on women, reproductive rights, i would be troubled by this nominee. %$* 567
and his current views on these issues... %$* 567
you're troubled by anyone other than ruth bader ginsburg. %$* 388
come on. %$* 388
all right. %$* 360
no, i have a mixed -- mixed emotion about sandra day o'connor. %$* 567
all right. %$* 360
let's  while we take a break. %$* 360
senator rick santorum lashes out at senator hilly clinton over the issue of children's rights, coming up. %$* 360
we'll focus on the pennsylvania republican's comments about the democratic senator from new york. %$* 360
the "strategy session" continues on inside politics. %$* 360
with us today, democratic strategist donna brazile and republican strategist rich galen. %$* 360
the john bolton appointment isn't the only thing that has democrats stirred up. %$* 360
on abc news this week, republican senator rick santorum challenged his democratic colleague, senator hillary clinton, to a debate on the issue of raising children. %$* 360
and he said she was a radical feminist. %$* 360
i mean, if you read her work and what she's done on children's rights, i mean, that's radical. %$* 550
i mean, you're talking about giving children the same -- that children have rights equal to adults. %$* 550
i mean, that is not a nurturing atmosphere of mothers and fathers taking responsibility for shaping the moral vision of their children. %$* 550
responding to santorum's comments, phil singer, with the democratic senatorial campaign committee, says, quote, "every time rick santorum opens his mouth, he shows he would've been one of the century's 13 greatest senators . %$* 360
over the last few weeks, he has, among other things, blamed an entire city for the crimes of pedophiles; published a book that is offensive to women everywhere, and panned the goals of diversity. %$* 360
this is not a person whose words should be taken very seriously." %$* 360
so, rick santorum in a tight race, of course, for reelection. %$* 360
is this good strategy for him? %$* 360
well, first of all, he should not be picking a fight with hillary. %$* 567
the last one that picked a fight with hillary, rick lazio, well, ended up you know where. %$* 567
so i think it would be a better idea to pick a fight with someone in pennsylvania, and that's mr. casey. %$* 567
look, hillary clinton, when she was a law student, wrote an article about children's rights, and that was a sentence in a law article that she wrote. %$* 567
there's nothing in her book -- i read it. %$* 567
you know, i read her book back in 1996. %$* 567
there's nothing in her book that suggests that children and adults should have equal rights. %$* 567
she wrote a great book about media culture and of course raising children in these times. %$* 567
and i also read rick santorum's book. %$* 567
i read the dailies . %$* 567
he sent me a copy. %$* 567
we're fellow catholics, so we do a lot of sharing of books and information. %$* 567
and in his book, he makes a case, as a conservative, that there are other approaches that should be taken to solving problems facing families in this century. %$* 567
so it's two different views of what it takes to raise children in this culture. %$* 567
let me tell you something. %$* 388
if you're going to sell a book -- you can go to borders or crown or wherever, and you go to the political section, you will not see a title that says, "you know, everything is going pretty well and i'm sort of happy about it." %$* 388
that ain't the way you sell a book in this country. %$* 388
you've got to get to an edge. %$* 388
and i think you're wrong. %$* 388
in terms of selling a book and making his case, you know, we're talking about him today. %$* 388
picking a fight with senator clinton i think is exactly the right thing to do. %$* 388
he's picking a fight with a big best-seller author. %$* 567
but, look, bill clinton didn't pick a fight, and he went out and sold millions of copies. %$* 567
i would think that he would find another way to sell his book. %$* 567
it also seems like he continues to really sort of massage the right, to massage conservative voters there in the state of pennsylvania. %$* 360
but the question is, doesn't he need to move more to the middle as we get closer to the election? %$* 360
well, it doesn't look that way. %$* 388
i mean, as donna said, you look at casey, the guy that's going to run again him, he's pro-life. %$* 388
you're going to have -- if he should win -- which i don't think he will -- the democrats would go out of their way to elect a senator that won't be allowed to speak at their convention, but that's another story. %$* 388
but i think what we have learned in pennsylvania, it is a very conservative. %$* 388
i mean, arlen specter almost got knocked off in a primary by a very conservative member of congress. %$* 388
so i think santorum is a pretty crafty guy. %$* 388
and he's probably going about this the right way for his reasons. %$* 388
and how does this bode for his possible presidential ambitions, which still aren't certain? %$* 360
well, first of all, i do believe santorum will have to appeal to the middle in pennsylvania. %$* 567
i mean, there's a lot of, you know, swing counties in the state of pennsylvania. %$* 567
i'm familiar with that blue state. %$* 567
but there's no question that in picking the fight with hillary, what he's trying to do is to draw a bigger name into the fight so he doesn't have to really challenge mr. casey. %$* 567
and mr. casey has done a great job in reaching out. %$* 567
i don't think mr. santorum will run for president in 2008. %$* 567
i think he's going to focus on the senate and let the, you know, the chips fall where they may, so to speak. %$* 567
yes, i think i agree with that. %$* 388
he's on a pretty good leadership track in the senate. %$* 388
i think he likes -- he's comfortable there. %$* 388
i think he's got -- despite these sorts of flare-ups, he's got a great deal of respect from both sides. %$* 388
i think you're right. %$* 388
it does look like he has some problems. %$* 360
if you can show me the graphic. %$* 360
we have a graphic from a quinnipiac university poll, 2006. %$* 360
this was done july 6 through the 10th, shows bob casey 50 percent to rick santorum, 39 percent. %$* 360
now, that is a high-rankings member of the senate leadership, very well known, great name recognition obviously in his own state, and he doesn't look real strong right now. %$* 360
it goes back to some of the remarks he's made. %$* 567
i mean, the recent statements about pedophiles in boston. %$* 567
i mean, he's picking a lot of fights. %$* 567
he's picked a fight now with kerry, with senator kerry, senator kennedy, and now senator clinton. %$* 567
i mean, at some point, he needs to pick a fight with mr. casey, because that's where the opposition is coming from. %$* 567
well, i haven't seen the poll, so i don't know whether -- we don't know whether that was likely voters, i mean, who was involved in the poll; what the question was; whether it's a reelect question or whether it's a "who would you vote for?" %$* 388
question. %$* 388
but he's in trouble no matter what the methodology. %$* 567
well, you'd rather be ahead. %$* 388
there's no question about that. %$* 388
but the election's not today. %$* 388
i mean, the election's a long way off. %$* 388
and i think he's laying the groundwork to be able to what? %$* 388
solidify his base, and then you go back to the middle. %$* 388
yes, well, a lot of other things have to be considered here as well. %$* 360
and number one, i mean, what is going to happen in this state when we do get around to another presidential election, too? %$* 360
you know, last time it was pretty interesting in pennsylvania. %$* 360
well, i think it's going to be another interesting race in 2006. %$* 567
and that is, governor rendell is up for reelection, and he has an opponent. %$* 567
but i must tell you this: senator santorum's book, when women read that book, i would say head to the hills or head to get a glass of something cold, because it really -- there are some comments about women's role in the family as well as women should not have to work, and public schools that would make some women pretty upset in pennsylvania and other places. %$* 567
all right, let's take a break. %$* 360
a name you know very well, donna -- al gore launches a new television network. %$* 360
will it be a hit? %$* 360
and will it be a platform for a new political career for the former vice president? %$* 360
that's our focus when we return to the "strategy session." %$* 360
i'm wolf blitzer in washington. %$* 142
we're getting this just in to cnn. %$* 142
british police have said they've arrested two more individuals in connection with the botched july 21 bombings of the london transportation system. %$* 142
the statement says they were arrested on suspicion of the commission, preparation, or instigation of acts of terrorism. %$* 142
much more on this coming up at the top of the hour. %$* 142
also at the top of the hour, president bush uses a recess appointment to make john bolton the new u.s. ambassador to united nations. %$* 142
we'll talk with former presidential adviser david gergen. %$* 142
a new era in oil-rich saudi arabia. %$* 142
the former crown prince abdullah is now king following the death of his half-brother king fahd. %$* 142
we'll have details. %$* 142
and baltimore orioles superstar rafael palmeiro is suspended for failing a steroids test. %$* 142
we'll have reaction and charlie steiner, standing by to help us better understand what's going on. %$* 142
all those stories, much more only minutes away on wolf blitzer reports. %$* 142
now back to inside politics. %$* 142
the "strategy session" continues on inside politics. %$* 360
with me today, democratic strategist donna brazile and republican strategist rich galen. %$* 360
we turn or attention now, to a new venture by former vice president al gore. %$* 360
he's just launched a television network: "current tv." %$* 360
it's considered a hipper tv-newsmagazine network targeted at 18- to-34-year-olds. %$* 360
so donna brazile, you know al gore very well. %$* 360
what's he up to with this? %$* 360
well, first of all, he's one of the co-founders of this great new concept to allow young people to really have not just their voice, but also their image, their views and of course their values on tv. %$* 567
this is a great venture, along with other people. %$* 567
gore has been, you know, developing this idea for over two years and he's quite excited about it. %$* 567
the roll-out began today and of course, you can go on the web and view it. %$* 567
you don't have to sit in your living room or your boob-a-toir . %$* 567
you can watch it on tv at www.currenttv.com. %$* 567
that's my plug for al gore. %$* 567
and what's your take? %$* 360
naomi wolf will be doing the costuming. %$* 388
it'll be terrific, i think. %$* 388
don't you? %$* 388
here, this has been going on for two years. %$* 388
let me read you what adage said two years ago, "this will be a combination of mtv and cnn." %$* 388
do you think this is a good combination with cnn? %$* 388
well, now donna, have you gotten any inside scoop on this thing though? %$* 360
i mean, is this beginning of yet another run for the white house perhaps? %$* 360
well, you know, al gore said that he's a recovering politician. %$* 567
in fact, he's on step nine, i guess, of his 12-step program. %$* 567
well, that's the apology step. %$* 388
and he is stepping over... %$* 567
i just saw on that on "seinfeld." %$* 388
no, this is stepping away from politics, washing your hands and -- look, and really creating a new forum for young people. %$* 567
al gore has always been committed, as you know, to technology, to the sciences, to art, and to politics. %$* 567
and what he's doing is giving young people their own platform and i'm very excited about it. %$* 567
i hope it works. %$* 388
i mean i -- one of the problems that we are facing as a society, is that a huge proportion of young people 18 to 24, get most of their news from david letterman and from jay leno and from the late-night shows. %$* 388
they don't understand this. %$* 388
so, anything anybody can do to bring whatever, however -- i don't care if it's slanted, not slanted, at least get people thinking and talking about current events, i'm for -- discuss current events. %$* 388
i don't understand the business model, but you know, i've been poor most of my life. %$* 388
so, what would i know? %$* 388
but it is true, though, isn't it, that al gore's sort of changing his old persona? %$* 360
he's sort of remaking himself, once again. %$* 360
no, i don't think so. %$* 567
i think this is an extension of what al gore tried to create years ago when he created the internet. %$* 567
he's bringing it all together now. %$* 567
now we have tv, the internet. %$* 567
we have everything working together and look, what he's doing is giving young people an opportunity to create their own noise and to put their own content on there. %$* 567
eighty percent of the content on this network will be original content by and for young people and those young at heart, of course, like us. %$* 567
it'll be dreadful and nobody will watch it, but that's ok. %$* 388
come on. %$* 567
it's going to be hip. %$* 567
you're probably going to tune in tonight. %$* 567
that's right. %$* 388
i've got two words for you, tucker carlson. %$* 388
the -- but here -- this is a much better venture than his first idea, which was to have a satellite in space focused on the earth 24 hours a day. %$* 388
remember that great idea, when he was vice president. %$* 388
that didn't go anywhere, either. %$* 388
so, we'll see how this one goes. %$* 388
thank you, both. %$* 360
donna brazile, rich galen, it's been a pleasure and talk to you again soon. %$* 360
i'll give him the original "current" t-shirt. %$* 567
i'll wear it. %$* 388
all right. %$* 360
thank you. %$* 567
potential internet gold mine or boondoggle? %$* 360
up next, our blog reporters on how some bloggers hope to cash in on the things they do. %$* 360
political blogs may be the rage of the blogosphere, but can they make money? %$* 360
joining us again, cnn political producer abbi tatton and jacki schechner, our blog reporter - jacki? %$* 360
hi, joe. %$* 325
well, can you make money off your blog and if so, what's the best way to do it? %$* 325
as the medium continues to grow, this is a question that keeps coming up over and over again. %$* 325
and ann althouse , who is a law professor in wisconsin and a popular conservative blogger, did a comparison over the weekend, a compare and contrast of two services, one of them being the leader in the market and the other being an upstart on the horizon. %$* 325
and this brought the discussion up once again. %$* 325
the medium still is very young and people are trying to work out these sites that are getting some tens of thousands hits a day. %$* 384
how can we make money off them? %$* 384
well, there's a couple of advertising services out there linking advertisers to blogs. %$* 384
right now, blogads.com, which was started in 2002, they get advertisers, place the ads on a blog-by-blog basis. %$* 384
and challenging them for another service that's going to be out there soon, is roger l. simon and a couple of his fellow bloggers, who want this pajamas media, hoping to aggregate blogs into one big group so corporate sponsors can place their ads over the whole group at once. %$* 384
john amato is at crooksandliars.com. %$* 384
he's one of the people that uses blog ads right now. %$* 384
you can see them when the site loads down the side of the page and john amato is currently ranked at crooksandliars.com -- he's currently ranked about 12th in the hits. %$* 384
he gets about 67,000 clicks a day. %$* 384
his is a video blog. %$* 384
sometimes it takes a little bit longer to load. %$* 384
there you go, there. %$* 384
you can see the blog ads down the side. %$* 384
but event though he gets all these hits, he has all these ads, what he tells us, he's certainly not making a living through this, although it is getting better as time goes on. %$* 384
same theme of "it's getting better" from john aravosis at americablog.com. %$* 325
you might remember john was the blogger who was contacted by the white house last week, to clarify a story -- says his ad revenue is growing, but still not enough to fully compensate his staff and still not enough to make him as much money as his consulting business does. %$* 325
and he is one of the top liberal bloggers. %$* 325
so, no matter how big you are at this point, there are very, very small few making money. %$* 325
we saw the same thing over at aceofspace  headquarters. %$* 325
it's says that "the long story short for him, you can't make money unless you're one of the top ten. %$* 325
so, probably best not to try at all." %$* 325
ace says, by the way, joe, he is going to go back to his side business, which is making sequined throw pillows. %$* 325
we'll send it back to you. %$* 325
jacki and abbi, thanks, much. %$* 360
that's it for inside politics. %$* 360
i'm joe johns. %$* 360

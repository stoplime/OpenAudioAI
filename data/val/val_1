the first debate -- %$* 53
whew! %$* 149
ok. %$* 149
-- made her happy. %$* 53
one down, two to go. %$* 149
and him grumpy. %$* 53
what a rigged deal. %$* 5
i'll tell you, we're in such a rigged -- it is terrible. %$* 5
now, donald trump hints the rematch might be bruising. %$* 53
the clintons are the sordid past. %$* 5
he can run his campaign however he chooses. %$* 149
one week to round two. %$* 53
but first, the running mates get their debate test. %$* 53
when donald trump becomes president, the days of the rigged system for the favored few are over. %$* 125
hillary and i have a plan. %$* 215
if we're out there and we see somebody who needs a hand, we're kind of a people that want to just roll out our sleeves and do what we can. %$* 215
inside politics, the biggest stories sourced by the best reporters, now. %$* 53
welcome to inside politics. %$* 53
i'm john king. %$* 53
thanks for sharing your sunday morning. %$* 53
three big questions as we countdown to one week to the second presidential debate, and just two days until the vice president running mates square off. %$* 53
does donald trump have no choice to release his tax returns? %$* 151
he says he would run a government just like his business. %$* 151
the 1990s tax returns obtained by "the new york times" show nearly $1 billion in losses in just one year and the possibility he could have avoided paying federal taxes for nearly two decades. %$* 151
but you have paid federal taxes? %$* 208
of course, i paid federal taxes. %$* 5
question two: what, if anything, can trump do now to recover from a horrible stretch that includes overnight tweets about sex tapes, more disparaging comments about women, and fresh questions about his temperament and judgment? %$* 53
hillary clinton's only loyalty is to her financial contributors and to herself. %$* 5
i don't think she's loyal to bill, if you want to know the truth. %$* 5
and really, folks -- really, why should she be, right? %$* 5
and question three, will hillary clinton return the favor? %$* 53
she got a bounce out of debate one. %$* 53
but a new recording of her take on bernie sanders supporters reminds us there's plenty of time left for missteps and momentum swings. %$* 53
and on the other side, there's a deep desire to believe that, you know, we can have free college, free health care, that what we've done hasn't gone far enough and we just need to go as far as, you know, scandinavia, whatever that means. %$* 149
whatever that means. %$* 53
abby phillip of "the washington post", cnn's manu raju, matt viser of "the boston globe", and jackie kucinich of "the daily beast." %$* 177
it is choosing time for donald trump and his chances of becoming president just may hang in the balance. %$* 177
for starters, we've said this here before, there's no excuse for any candidate for president not to release his or her tax returns. %$* 177
but now, we have a glimpse into just what donald trump might not want you to know. %$* 177
"the new york times" obtained summaries to state front pages of %$* 177
trump's 1995 taxes. %$* 177
they show that in one year, trump claimed more than $916 million in losses. %$* 177
his casinos were losing money. %$* 177
his airline was a failure. %$* 177
and he made some bad real estate buys. %$* 177
plus, tax expert consulted by "the times" said such a big loss and the way trump takes legal advantage of loopholes and tax credits could have allowed him to avoid paying federal income taxes up to 18 years. %$* 177
excuse me. %$* 177
hillary clinton made a big issue, you remember of trump's secrecy of the first debate. %$* 177
and remember, this is what he told cnn's dana bash after. %$* 177
it sounds like you admitted that you hadn't paid federal taxes and that that was smart. %$* 32
is that what you meant to say? %$* 32
no, i didn't say that at all. %$* 5
i mean, if they say i didn't, i mean, it doesn't matter. %$* 5
i will say this, i hate the way our government spends our taxes. %$* 5
what now? %$* 53
what now? %$* 53
and i want to say, donald trump is up early this morning tweeting about this story. %$* 53
he says at 7:22, "i know our complex tax laws better than anyone who has run for president and i'm the only one to fix that." %$* 53
does not give us any more information. %$* 53
doesn't say "the times" account is absolutely right. %$* 53
they found his old accountant who said, yes, those of them -- those are legit. %$* 53
you know this was a debate a week from now and between now and then, the vice presidential candidates' debate. %$* 53
the pressure on trump to show us more, especially more recent, is going to be huge. %$* 53
well, i mean, i think he probably was very unlikely to release his tax returns at all had this not come out. %$* 153
i mean, i actually kind of think it makes it harder for him because right now, there's an insinuation he didn't pay taxes for 18 years. %$* 153
if he releases more documentation, we will know for sure, and it's likely to show he didn't or potentially worse. %$* 153
so, he's in a bind right now and they are doing, think, probably the best they can by spinning it a case of him doing what's legally allowed to him. %$* 153
but i think voters are going to look at this situation and ask themselves, $900 million in losses? %$* 153
and the first thing that you did was essentially not paid taxes. %$* 153
you are not like us. %$* 153
so, it's real liability. %$* 153
it goes to the heart of the attack of donald trump and the centerpiece of his campaign that he's a good businessman. %$* 146
and that's one of the biggest things that the clinton campaign is seizing on right now, saying that look, he once lost a billion dollars in one year that undermines his entire candidacy. %$* 146
so, tax questions aside, which, frankly, they're actually not even denying that he may not have paid taxes for this long. %$* 146
they are not confirming or denying. %$* 146
and you can assume that if this was wrong, they'd be furiously denying this account. %$* 146
but it does, i think the bigger issue is on his business record, which is, of course, what he's running for president -- %$* 146
it's also how he talks about it. %$* 189
i think there is a -- "the washington post" story last week, right after the debate from north carolina, where donald trump bragged about not paying taxes because he was smart. %$* 189
there was a gasp in the room. %$* 189
i think people look at that and look at their balance sheets and makes him look less relatable, and it makes him look like he's getting away with something that average every day americans have to do every april, whether they like it or not. %$* 189
there's a record of trump, you know, just a year ago he tweeted about how hedge fund managers pay almost nothing on their taxes and they need to be held to account. %$* 216
so trump now, you know, we know, was not paying taxes for a long period of time. %$* 216
and i agree. %$* 216
i mean, i think the business record is another thing that the clinton campaign will seize upon. %$* 216
a billion dollars is the gdp of some small countries, you know, and trump was saying that he lost that amount in1995 and that's going to be a huge issue i think for him going forward. %$* 216
and the little guy is his base of support. %$* 53
the white working class, he has other support, not just that, but it's the base of his support and look at this, look there's no indication donald trump did anything illegal. %$* 53
there's every indication that he took advantage of carry over loss, you carry over loss as you go forward. %$* 53
there's all these things set up. %$* 53
they have lobbyists to help them for rich real estate investments so that they can write things off and carry over losses. %$* 53
but if you're the little guy, you don't get to keep your private jet. %$* 53
you don't get to keep your penthouse. %$* 53
you don't get to keep your lifestyle of the rich and famous if you're having a bad year. %$* 53
so, that i think is one of the openings here. %$* 53
and to the point about the business acumen, hillary clinton knows from the republican primaries and she did in the first debate that's what gets under his skin. %$* 53
and their company is said when they said, now the gig is up. %$* 53
why doesn't he go ahead and release his tax return to show how smart he really is. %$* 53
they are trying to poke him. %$* 53
they're trying to poke him. %$* 146
whether -- he's not going to release his tax returns and that's one reason why. %$* 146
there' a lot of ammunition there potentially. %$* 146
he'd rather take the hit from shielding the release and not being transparent than by providing more information that could lead to damaging revelations, like this. %$* 146
potentially interesting math here, where 18 years would expire in 2013. %$* 216
mitt romney released two years of his taxes. %$* 216
so, if donald trump is going to follow mitt romney's model, he would release 2014 and 2015 when presumably this tax advantage that he was taking advantage of 18 years would have expired. %$* 216
so, i mean, i think trump, there's going to be increasing pressure on him to show us some of those tax returns. %$* 216
increasing pressure. %$* 53
but does the answer -- the original reaction from the campaign the "new york times" had this story, "new york times" has been work on this story for a bit. %$* 53
and the delicious part of it they said they were mailed these copies his new york, connecticut and new jersey state tax returns and they say the return address was trump tower. %$* 53
so, presumably, you can infer from that, somebody within the trump organization decided to send these to "the new york times". %$* 53
the trump statement, was, "the only news here is that more than 20-year-old alleged tax document was illegally obtained, a further demonstration that 'the new york times', like establishment media in general," i think he means us, "is an extension of the clinton campaign, the democratic party and their global special interest." %$* 53
predictable, but forgive me, laughable. %$* 53
if you're a trump supporter out there, just go on the internet right now, while we're having this conversation. %$* 53
"the new york times" has had some groundbreaking reporting on hillary clinton's problems. %$* 53
her transparency issues, the clinton foundation, her e-mail server. %$* 53
that dog just doesn't hunt. %$* 53
i mean, donald trump is glaringly out of step here with just about every bit of precedent that we have about how presidential nominees run, and so it's very hard for them to make an argument asking for tax returns is something that's beyond the pale for a presidential nominee. %$* 153
and what's interesting about the way "the times" this sort of glimpse of trump from "the times" is that it actually comes at a time when he was dealing with a lot of losses related to his management of atlantic city casinos. %$* 153
and that's something for the clinton folks is pure gold. %$* 153
i mean, they want to talk about that as much as possible. %$* 153
who did he pay? %$* 153
who did he not pay? %$* 153
and how did he walk out of that r& place with so much in losses and manage to potentially make money at the end of the day by not paying taxes? %$* 153
let's go back to the first debate as we continue the conversation because this was a ripe issue in the first debate. %$* 53
and we know hillary clinton benefitted from that debate. %$* 53
so, we know -- now especially now that this is out there, she wants to make it a big issue in the second debate. %$* 53
let's listen. %$* 53
maybe he doesn't want the american people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes because the only years that anybody has ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax. %$* 149
so -- %$* 149
that makes me smart. %$* 5
you mentioned that. %$* 53
that makes me smart. %$* 53
at another point, he said when she was criticizing for filing bankruptcy and not paying the little guys who work on those casinos, the people who put the carpets, and the people who put the cabinets and the people who put the drapes in, he said that's good business. %$* 53
that's what a good businessman does. %$* 53
this is where we're going here because trump's whole thing is populism, that i'm for the little guy. %$* 53
yes. %$* 146
to the extent that it goes there. %$* 216
i mean, the clinton campaign, some of her better moments when she was talking about the contractor or sort of these little guys and you can imagine the trump campaign now bringing some of those people out front like we saw alicia machado last week and having them use those people as surrogates, people who've been stiffed by trump now at a time when we know that trump was not paying his federal income tax. %$* 216
it's going to be fascinating to hear how donald trump response to this story, when he's asked directly now, did you pay your federal taxes because as we played in the opening, he told dana bash that he did pay his federal taxes. %$* 146
when he said right now, it was smart during the debate, perhaps not to pay his taxes. %$* 146
so, has he paid his taxes or not? %$* 146
and what does mike pence say on tuesday? %$* 146
and for the trump supporters out there saying, you know, why are we focusing just on this, why not on hillary clinton's troubles? %$* 53
there are legitimate questions about the clinton foundation, legitimate questions about hillary clinton. %$* 53
but we know about those donors because the records are public. %$* 53
we know about her taxes and how wealthy they got on paid speeches because their taxes for 30 years are public. %$* 53
donald trump's are not. %$* 53
not exactly equal footing when it comes to transparency in this debate. %$* 53
ahead, trump's taxes aren't the only trouble at this critical moment. %$* 53
overnight, tweets and fresh questions about his temperament and his judgment. %$* 53
first, though, politicians say the darndest things with the little help from alec baldwin. %$* 53
he hasn't released his tax returns which means he's either not that rich. %$* 217
alec baldwin as donald trump:  wrong. %$* 217
not that charitable. %$* 218
wrong. %$* 219
or he's never played taxes in his life. %$* 218
wronger. %$* 219
welcome back. %$* 53
the latest tax controversy hardly donald trump's only rough patch this past week. %$* 53
more on that in a moment. %$* 53
but to hillary clinton and her campaign now. %$* 53
she knows trump spent the day since the first presidential debate promising to be more aggressive in the second and perhaps more personal, raising the monica lewinsky scandal and bill clinton's impeachment. %$* 53
he can run his campaign however he chooses. %$* 149
that's up to him. %$* 149
i'm going to keep talking about the stakes in this election. %$* 149
i'm going to keep talking about my agenda. %$* 149
looking back of the past week is interesting. %$* 53
she has been talking about her agenda and methodically checking the boxes. %$* 53
stops in new hampshire and florida, targeting millennials and a visit to iowa, want to gin up early voting. %$* 53
a new spanish language ad, excuse me, aimed at latinos in key swing states. %$* 53
i'm building a wall. %$* 5
he's a mexican. %$* 5
they're bringing crime, they are rapists. %$* 5
it's a disciplined strategy but there was a weekend hiccup. %$* 53
an audio obtained by a hacker in which she's speaking at a campaign fundraiser and discussing bernie sanders supporters. %$* 53
some are new to politics completely. %$* 149
they're children of the great recession. %$* 149
and they are living in their parents' basement. %$* 149
oh, well. %$* 53
if you listen to the whole audio and go online and find it, folks, this was leaked to the "free beacon", a conservative publication here in d.c., if you listen to the whole audio, she does say, we need to understand this. %$* 53
she's trying to say to her fundraisers, we need to understand the discontent and disenchantment. %$* 53
but if you take snippets of this, it seems at times condescending. %$* 53
yes. %$* 153
i mean, this is an extension of something that she used to kind of do on the trail in the primaries, especially as things started getting really hairy with bernie towards the end. %$* 153
she would say things like, you know, sanders supporters need to read the fine print. %$* 153
nothing in life is free. %$* 153
you can't get free college, free health care, free this, free that -- and that's kind of where she was going with this. %$* 153
but i have to say, i mean, living in your parents' basement thing sounds like, you know, older folks say about younger folks when they are trying to be basically like, you don't do anything for what you have. %$* 153
and that's probably the place she shouldn't have gone. %$* 153
but it does sort of like speak of where they were, you know, six months ago when she was trying to convince a lot of democrats, hey, like i get why you want this stuff but it just can't be free. %$* 153
but it comes at a really difficult time because she's struggling with the millennial vote right now. %$* 146
you see poll after poll showing that a lot of those voters are going to gary johnson and not coming to her. %$* 146
these are people who do support bernie sanders and probably the same people that she's putting down there, they are living in their parents' basement. %$* 146
so, even if it's a snippet, it gives the ammunition that the trump campaign needs. %$* 146
and also this idea that she's saying this to her friends behind closed doors to donors, just like basket of deplorables, like she's putting one face forward to bernie sanders supporters saying, "please come vote for me," and then behind closed doors, saying, look at these kids. %$* 189
so, that two-faced appearance also is just -- that's hurtful. %$* 189
basket of deplorables, fundraiser, this, fundraiser, 47 percent for mitt romney, fundraiser. %$* 53
politicians, take note, study your history. %$* 53
donald trump jumping in immediately -- you know, donald trump wants some of these voters. %$* 53
if they don't vote for him they will be happy in some states if they go vote for gary johnson or jill stein. %$* 53
so, listen to donald trump on the trail kind of trying to make hay. %$* 53
hillary clinton thinks bernie sanders supporters are hopeless and ignorant basement dwellers. %$* 5
then, of course, she thinks people who vote for and follow us are deplorable and irredeemable. %$* 5
i don't think so. %$* 5
what trump said is not exactly what she said. %$* 53
not exactly, not close. %$* 53
but you don't blame him, right? %$* 53
that's what you do in politics. %$* 53
you use a little hyperbole to take advantage of what they perceive as an opening. %$* 53
matt, the clinton campaign put out a statement saying, "as hillary clinton said in those remarks, she wants young people to be idealistic and set big goals. %$* 53
she is fighting for exactly what the millennial generation cares most about -- a fairer, more equal, just world." %$* 53
this is not the way she put it at the fundraiser. %$* 53
she said none of those words. %$* 216
here's what she really meant. %$* 216
yes, i mean, i think this is a problem for hillary clinton. %$* 216
you know, she has had problems, you know, sort of uniting the party. %$* 216
you know, but just sort of the context on the campaign is whoever we're talking about is losing almost. %$* 216
i mean, both of these candidates are deeply unliked by the american public. %$* 216
and so, hillary clinton has kind of won the past week mostly in the context that we've been talking a lot about donald trump, you know? %$* 216
and so, i think if she can sort of quickly move past this and get back on trump which the taxes give her sort of an easy opening to do. %$* 216
and it's not like donald trump hasn't said nasty things about big groups of people. %$* 189
i mean, probably every minority group has a trump insult they can throw back at him. %$* 189
so, no one has the market cornered on being nice to everyone. %$* 189
so, that should be said. %$* 189
i mean, mexican rapist, muslims shouldn't come in to this country, go on and on and on. %$* 189
if you go state by state and look at the polling, this is one of her glaring weaknesses. %$* 53
we saw her this past week. %$* 53
it's a very methodical disciplined campaign. %$* 53
they are trying to reassemble the obama coalition. %$* 53
they look at 2008, they look at 2012, they say, if the electorate looks like that, we win, especially if people turn out and vote early. %$* 53
one of the groups you try to get to vote early is the millennials, because they're not the most reliable. %$* 53
they haven't been part of the system. %$* 53
they're not as invested in the parties. %$* 53
how does she make sure that you -- does she have to come back to the %$* 53
back of the plane this is what i meant to say and maybe they take offense. %$* 53
yes, i think she'll probably have to answer for this one, one way or another, both taking those words that were written by her spokesman and just actually saying them this time. %$* 153
but i also think that they have a lot of other work to do. %$* 153
i mean, some of this same stuff she was saying in the primaries and the reason why there's so many hard feelings left over. %$* 153
so, the challenge isn't different, it's just continuing on. %$* 153
and for donald trump, i mean, this -- any vote for gary johnson at the moment is helping him because it's preventing hillary clinton from rising higher. %$* 153
but it's not helping him get any higher either and he has to do both. %$* 153
he has to bring her down and raise himself up and i don't think really that this is enough to do it. %$* 153
but as we also see, democrats make a more concerted effort targeting gary johnson, not attacking him personally but making that argument a vote for gary johnson effectively is helping donald trump. %$* 146
it will be interesting to see bernie sanders start to make that argument, if he does more aggressively. %$* 146
because he is going to be a bigger presence on the campaign trail going forward. %$* 146
and interesting to see if bernie sanders in his events this next week calm down, folks, here's what she meant. %$* 53
here's the context she meant. %$* 53
don't worry about hillary clinton because i'm sure bernie sanders looks at part of these remarks, again, she did say at one point, we need to understand this, telling her donors, you know, there's frustration that's out there. %$* 53
but bernie sanders is going to look at this and maybe have some issues. %$* 53
we'll see. %$* 53
everybody, sit tight. %$* 53
up next, overnight tweets, more controversial comments about women. %$* 53
what happened to donald trump's repeated promises to be more presidential? %$* 53
and please take our inside politics quiz. %$* 53
which of the running mates do you think has been most effective so far? %$* 53
mike pence, tim kaine, bill weld, or haven't you been paying enoughj attention? %$* 53
have an opinion on that question. %$* 53
vote at cnn.com/vote. %$* 53
welcome back. %$* 53
there are a lot of reasons, how much time you got, to explain that our campaigns are too long. %$* 53
but one upside is that a year or more of grueling campaigning and intense pressure reveals a lot about a person. %$* 53
we were told, for example, and told repeatedly that donald trump understood the responsibilities of being a republican nominee and of being a possible president. %$* 53
yet, he refused to rigorously prepare for the first debate. %$* 53
we were told repeatedly, past disparaging comments about women were meant as jokes or entertainment, and that trump, the presidential candidate would be different from trump the reality tv star. %$* 53
but here's trump the presidential just the other day explaining his dealings with the former miss universe. %$* 53
she was the worst we ever had, the worst, the absolute worst. %$* 5
she was impossible. %$* 5
she gained a massive amount of weight and it was -- it was a real problem. %$* 5
we had a real problem. %$* 5
not only that, her attitude. %$* 5
and forget what donald trump's staff tells reporter. %$* 53
donald trump himself has repeatedly promised top campaign aides and the top leaders of the republican party, he knows he needs to be presidential and to dial it back on social media. %$* 53
yet this past week, another overnight tweet storm attacking critics and urging people, yes, to watch a sex tape. %$* 53
so, if there's one undisputable lesson of the past week, it is that donald trump is who he is and i don't think anyone at the table would disagree unlikely he'll change. %$* 53
they get him to read the teleprompter for a day or two. %$* 53
but even last night, he had prepared remarks and then he wanders off. %$* 53
heading to the second debate and especially this critical week before the second debate, we'll get to t polls in a minute. %$* 53
and hillary clinton came out of the first debate with some momentum. %$* 53
what do they do? %$* 53
they do what he did in the run-up to the first debate which is to deliver a succinct message on the campaign trail. %$* 146
he made that argument he's the candidate of change and she's been in washington for 30 plus years and hope that mike pence on tuesday can reset the narrative. %$* 146
the problem is that donald trump is still digging up, bringing up issues like hillary clinton's past,  bill clinton's past sex scandals -- issues that make a lot of republicans frankly that they deal into this territory. %$* 146
they want him to get back at that message that he did in the run-up to the debate. %$* 146
before you jump in, they put him on a teleprompter. %$* 220
and again, trump has promised the speaker of the house, the senate majority leader, the chairman of the republican national committee. %$* 220
i get it. %$* 220
i understand house and senate and dog catcher candidates depend on me. %$* 220
and yet -- so they put him on a teleprompter. %$* 220
and they said, see, we have donald trump disciplined. %$* 220
and that's why he was rising in the polls. %$* 220
but yesterday, yesterday, he had a prompter but educationally decided to deviate. %$* 220
now she's got bad temperament. %$* 5
she's got -- she could be crazy. %$* 5
she could actually be crazy. %$* 5
you were saying? %$* 53
you know, it actually still applies. %$* 189
he should take a cue from his running mate. %$* 189
i covered mike pence when he was in the house and mike pence -- it's hard to knock him off his talking points, it's hard to knock him off message. %$* 189
and he just keeps going back to his talking points no matter what the -- no matter what the topic is. %$* 189
donald trump needs to learn how to do that. %$* 189
and manu's right. %$* 189
we started to see that a little bit. %$* 189
but then when you get under his skin, when you get a little far afield he just -- he takes it and runs with it. %$* 189
so maybe he and mike pence should be locked in a room together. %$* 189
mike pence could teach him the secret sauce to that. %$* 189
but trump did -- he did a good job for a couple of weeks because he was on message. %$* 216
but it's almost like he's sort of a jack in the box. %$* 216
you know what i mean? %$* 216
you wind him up and you can keep him down there for a while but his true self pops back up, you know, again and again after you wind him up. %$* 216
and he's done that over and over again where i think it's not just in his dna to sort of be quiet and not sort of go off message. %$* 216
the problem for him last week was that he got under the skin with the alicia machado stuff and he was focused on her and not hillary clinton. %$* 216
a good politician can somehow pivot from talking about machado to redirecting the attack at hillary clinton which donald trump failed at over and over again. %$* 216
right. %$* 53
and again, you know, trump supporters will say, there they go again in the media, you know, saying donald trump shouldn't do this, donald trump shouldn't do that. %$* 53
ok.  give us a break for second. %$* 53
here's the former speaker of the house and a trump adviser, newt gingrich, on whether trump should be tweeting at 3:00 in the morning. %$* 53
you can't tweet at 3:00 in the morning. %$* 158
period. %$* 158
there's no excuse ever. %$* 158
not if you're going to be president of the united states. %$* 158
what trump has got to understand is he's either got to say, i got to be me or he's got to own a new song, i got to be president. %$* 158
they're not the same song. %$* 158
he's got to become much more disciplined. %$* 158
little late in the campaign to learn a new song as the former house speaker put it, isn't it? %$* 53
i mean, trump actually said that -- it was at the primary season that he was going to be so boring as a general election candidate we wouldn't even want to talk about him or cover him. %$* 146
but clearly that's not been the case. %$* 146
interesting to hear that come from newt gingrich who could have been his running mate. %$* 146
he was very close to being his running mate. %$* 146
but it just shows the level of concern there is within the republican party by donald trump doing things like this. %$* 146
i mean, to start with, i mean, somebody just needs to take his phone away. %$* 153
i mean, this is really the core of the problem. %$* 153
he cannot be left to his own devices on the internet because then he starts doing what he did last night. %$* 153
and -- %$* 153
left to his own devices. %$* 53
that's good. %$* 53
and you know, on top of that it just -- it does raise the question whether there's anyone around trump who can really tell him what to expect in a debate context when hillary clinton is trying to get under his skin. %$* 153
like is he willing to be prepared in the sense that people have to say mean things about him? %$* 153
and he has to be prepared to take it and internalize it and move on. %$* 153
and that's the kind of debate prep and sort of campaign prep that he needs to engage in really seriously because lord knows hillary clinton is engaging in that sort of thing. %$* 153
she has people saying mean things to her, knowing that that's what donald trump would do to her. %$* 153
but to your point about can anybody get to him, and again it has worked in short spurts. %$* 53
it has worked in short spurts. %$* 53
this is one of the reasons he's had three campaign managers. %$* 53
they said that they need -- you know, they brought in -- paul manafort was supposed to be the adult. %$* 53
that didn't work out. %$* 53
they brought in kellyanne conway, who said, forgive me, one of i think the most hilarious things of this past week she went on "the view" and she said of donald trump i don't think he gets credit for restraint. %$* 53
and restraint is a virtue, in fact a presidential virtue. %$* 53
you don't get cookies when you're running for president. %$* 153
maybe with a couple of hours later when the restraint -- %$* 216
you can restrain him for only so long. %$* 216
and hillary clinton wants to jump in on this. %$* 53
to your point, they think -- she thinks this is a temperament issue, she thinks this is a judgment issue. %$* 53
she also thinks the more she gets under his skin the more of the same she's going to get. %$* 53
who gets up at 3:00 in the morning to engage in a twitter attack against a former miss universe? %$* 149
i mean, he hurled as many insults as he could. %$* 149
really why does he do things like that? %$* 149
his latest twitter meltdown is unhinged even for him. %$* 149
it proves yet again that he's temperamentally unfit to be president and commander-in-chief. %$* 149
a lot of people, including the current president of the united states, have rebounded from bad first debates. %$* 53
plenty of time left in this race. %$* 53
but i do think that because of the combination of events, now the controversy about the taxes, this past week about the 3:00 a.m., 5:00 a.m. tweets, this is a very important week to 10 days for donald trump. %$* 53
it is and that's why -- how important it is for mike pence to have a good night on tuesday that could -- sort of to reset the narrative. %$* 146
i mean, in a lot of ways he delivers that argument against hillary clinton better than donald trump does. %$* 146
and to jackie's point earlier because he is relentlessly on message watch for him to do that. %$* 146
but -- %$* 53
but we are going to see how he -- the number of issues that he's different with donald. %$* 146
right. %$* 53
but what happens when either the moderator or tim kaine says, governor, have you ever tweeted at 3:00 a.m.? %$* 53
or governor, you released your taxes. %$* 53
what are the answers? %$* 53
well, mike pence is going to have to be himself. %$* 153
i mean, this is the point -- the part where mike pence is sort of like his own man. %$* 153
he's an island. %$* 153
you know, he'll release his taxes. %$* 153
he'll talk about things that donald trump won't. %$* 153
he'll just say, i don't know what donald trump will do, but here's what i'm going to do. %$* 153
he's going to have to. %$* 153
he doesn't have many options in this. %$* 153
mike pence 2020. %$* 189
yes. %$* 153
but he's got to have to worry about his own political hide, too. %$* 146
right. %$* 53
he does. %$* 53
it's a very -- it's a fascinating moment. %$* 53
now, everybody, sit tight. %$* 53
we know donald trump obsesses about polls and we know he isn't happy with the latest wave of data. %$* 53
next, the map heading into the second debate and the vice presidential debate is trending clinton's way. %$* 53
let me help you with the difference, miss ferraro, between iran and the embassy in lebanon. %$* 161
i almost resent, vice president bush, your patronizing attitude that you have to teach me about foreign policy. %$* 221
senator, i served with jack kennedy. %$* 222
i knew jack kennedy. %$* 222
jack kennedy was a friend of mine. %$* 222
senator, you're no jack kennedy. %$* 222
who am i? %$* 223
why am i here? %$* 223
hey, can i call you joe? %$* 224
i think the vice president very well knows that sometimes the words don't come out of your mouth the right way. %$* 225
but i always say what i mean. %$* 226
a little history there to get you excited about the faceoff in farmville as the vice presidential debate tuesday night between democrat tim kaine and republican mike pence. %$* 53
as they go into that debate the state of the race is moving in hillary clinton-tim kaine's direction. %$* 53
simple math. %$* 53
look at this from 2012. %$* 53
for donald trump to win he has to turn some of these blues red. %$* 53
he had momentum going into the first debate. %$* 53
but look at this. %$* 53
brand new poll just the other day, up in new hampshire, a seven-point clinton lead in a four- way race. %$* 53
small, only four electoral college votes but could be key in a very close race. %$* 53
michigan, donald trump has talked about reagan democrats becoming trump democrats, a seven-point lead for clinton. %$* 53
in one of those states donald trump has targeted, one of the blues, he wants to turn red. %$* 53
out in nevada, donald trump has been ahead consistently out here. %$* 53
surprising us. %$* 53
but a suffolk university poll at the end of the week shows clinton ahead in the state of nevada. %$* 53
the latino vote critical for her. %$* 53
the rural white vote critical for him. %$* 53
and in the biggest battleground states, still on the table as a tossup, donald trump's second home in florida, clinton ahead, even though trump had momentum going into the first debate. %$* 53
donald trump could not afford to lose that one. %$* 53
quickly, why does that matter? %$* 53
as of now, if you can't turn any of these light blues to red and win the tossup states, donald trump can't win. %$* 53
if hillary clinton can win florida, we just showed you that poll, and win nevada, game over. %$* 53
so the pressure is on mike pence, the pressure is also on donald trump who's enlisting his daughter now for a little help. %$* 53
my father will change outdated labor laws so that they support women and american families. %$* 5
he will provide tax credits for child care, paid maternity leave and dependent care savings accounts. %$* 5
this will allow women to support their families and further their careers. %$* 5
what are your expectations for the fracas in the farmville, the faceoff in farmville? %$* 53
what are we going to call it? %$* 53
i mean, this is both -- these are two seasoned politicians, who are going to go to bat for their candidates. %$* 189
we actually might see some policy. %$* 189
but we're also going to have see -- %$* 189
is that allowed? %$* 53
right. %$* 189
i know. %$* 189
it's shocking but i do think these two have a lot to defend for -- %$* 189
right. %$* 53
for their -- you know, the top of the ticket and we'll see a lot of that. %$* 189
they're almost the inverse of the top of the ticket where these two are relatively unknown to the public. %$* 216
they're fairly substantive, both of them. %$* 216
and they're not disliked like the people on the top of the ticket. %$* 216
so you do have a chance for maybe some policy, although i think both sides are just trying to pin the unpopular top of the ticket of each other. %$* 216
right. %$* 53
it becomes a proxy war. %$* 53
right? %$* 53
yes. %$* 216
mike pence wants to make the point that hillary clinton is corrupt and can't be trusted. %$* 53
tim kaine wants to make the point that donald trump is secretive, can't be trusted and is a loose cannon. %$* 53
one of the interesting things about tim kaine is his ability to actually sort of tell a good narrative story about his candidacy and hillary clinton's candidacy in a way that she actually struggles with. %$* 153
and so he's going to be out there actually on home turf in virginia, his home state, in a part of virginia that allows him to tell the story of, like, racial reconciliation and sort of tell a disorient diversity in america. %$* 153
i think we can expect to see more of that from tim kaine which kind of elevates the conversation, takes it a little bit out of the gutter and into a place that's a little bit more aspirational and hopeful. %$* 153
well, let's take you out to the campaign trail a little bit. %$* 53
you've probably spent and have given us plenty of reasons to spend most of our time looking at what donald trump say and what hillary clinton says. %$* 53
so sometimes the number twos, even in this race, maybe getting less attention than even normal because the number ones are so -- let's call it provocative or interesting to be polite. %$* 53
tim kaine, though, to abby's point, makes the case on the campaign trail that donald trump should not be in the situation room on big nights and that hillary clinton is ready. %$* 53
hillary showed she's prepared to be president and she's prepared be commander-in-chief. %$* 215
she offered the details of her plans. %$* 215
she gave us the stronger together vision. %$* 215
and on the other side, you have a guy who is, look, if you're that rattled in a debate tried to -- %$* 215
he's not exactly a dynamo, is likeable, he's a nice guy. %$* 53
both of these guys. %$* 53
i've known them both or covered both of them for a long time. %$* 53
they've very likeable guys, very approachable guys, low- key guys in their basic demeanor. %$* 53
that's not exactly scintillating. %$* 53
yes. %$* 146
he's kind of an awe-shucks guy. %$* 146
you know, they joke, everybody's uncle or something. %$* 146
not quite like uncle joe, joe biden, but he does know how to attack. %$* 146
he's a seasoned politician. %$* 146
he knows how to go on the offensive. %$* 146
kaine's job is to do is help continue donald trump's bleeding, if you will, because what we saw from that poll just now is that hillary clinton is ahead but not by a very comfortable margin. %$* 146
right. %$* 53
still a very, very tight race. %$* 146
what that first debate did is essentially halt donald trump's momentum, give hillary clinton some momentum but tim kaine needs to keep that momentum going forward because this race can easily shift, especially if tim kaine slips and mike pence has a good night. %$* 146
and one of the ways for it to swing back is if mike pence can get -- shift the conversation away from tweets about a former beauty queen at 3:00, 4:00, 5:00 in the morning. %$* 53
away from should donald trump release his taxes and did he really write-off $916 million in just one year, to you had a democratic president for eight years, how are you feeling about the economy, it's time for change. %$* 53
if you want change, if you want a stronger american at home and abroad that stands by our constitution and the highest standards in public life we have to decide here and now in the hosier state that hillary clinton will never be elected president of the united states of america. %$* 125
-- as well and during this debate, but i think at the end of the day i do wonder how many people are going to watch this debate and be like, man, i wish those guys were at the top of the ticket. %$* 189
good luck. %$* 53
but the change argument is absolutely essential because if you can convince people it's time for change then some of the other stuff doesn't matter as much. %$* 53
yes. %$* 146
what is this about? %$* 53
is this a referendum on obama and clinton and do we want four more years on democrats or is it a referendum on donald trump and is he fit to be president? %$* 53
and those are the best parts about donald trump's argument. %$* 216
you know? %$* 216
and mike pence doesn't have all the baggage that trump brings to the campaign and he's more practiced at debates. %$* 216
so you can imagine mike pence prosecuting the case against hillary clinton far better than donald trump can. %$* 216
and that was the worst part of hillary clinton's first debate performance, that first 30 minutes when donald trump was effectively making that argument. %$* 146
right. %$* 53
so watch for trump to try to do that on the campaign trail and mike pence as well. %$* 146
right. %$* 153
i mean, i think mike pence is going to be trump without trump, right? %$* 153
so take everything about him except donald, those other stuff. %$* 153
but i also think that in some ways pence and kaine are kind of well matched on that front. %$* 153
it's all of the message but without the candidates themselves. %$* 153
the baggage is the term some of the consultants could use there. %$* 53
everybody, sit tight, our reporters will give you a sneak peek into their notebook nest, including a big state maybe back in play. %$* 53
also, the results of our quiz question this morning. %$* 53
we asked you who has been the most effective running mate so far. %$* 53
most of you say tim kaine. %$* 53
let's head around the inside politics table, and ask our great reporters to give you a sneak peek into their notebooks. %$* 53
a little bit of ahead of the curve move on the big political news. %$* 53
abby phillip? %$* 53
well, ohio is back on the map this week. %$* 153
it's been a state that's kind of slipping from hillary clinton for the last couple of weeks but she's headed back there this week, tomorrow and bill clinton is going to do two days on the ground there, busting it around in eastern ohio. %$* 153
and they have an opportunity right now between the first and the second debate to take advantage of whatever momentum she has going into the second debate and turn things around. %$* 153
the key here, especially for hillary clinton, will be working class women in the suburbs and some of those women are going to be paying close attention to what's been going on with donald trump these last few days especially with some of his meltdowns around miss universe, alicia machado, and other things. %$* 153
let's see if she can put ohio back on the map. %$* 53
it's always good to have good battleground states. %$* 53
manu? %$* 53
john, this is north carolina that's become a major presidential battleground, that's now becoming central to the fight for the senate majority. %$* 146
senator richard burr, the republican incumbent, now in a really tough fight against a little known democrat named deborah ross. %$* 146
republicans, when you talk to them around town, they're very worried that this seat could slip if a lot more money does not start to go into this state. %$* 146
donald trump, for one, is not spending as nearly as much as hillary clinton that's helping the democrats at large. %$* 146
and watch for republicans to really go after deborah ross's record as an aclu attorney. %$* 146
this is a state that actually was the most expensive state in the 2014 midterms. %$* 146
tens and tens of millions of dollars are going there because they know we need to save richard burr, if they want to keep the senate majority. %$* 146
right. %$* 53
we hear a lot of republicans complain he hasn't taken this one seriously enough. %$* 53
matt? %$* 53
the baseball playoffs are starting. %$* 216
and those from red sox nation are looking to david ortiz to deliver another championship. %$* 216
but it's another red sox player that we're seeing on the political attention. %$* 216
curt schilling is -- continues to make waves and discuss possibly running in 2018 against elizabeth warren as a senator in massachusetts. %$* 216
there are a lot of reasons to be skeptical about this. %$* 216
curt schilling has talked in the past about running and he didn't. %$* 216
he's made some controversial statements that got him fired at espn. %$* 216
and recent poll that he's serious enough he's included in polls it showed him down 19 percent to elizabeth warren. %$* 216
and proud member of the nation, in the sports box, he's forever %$* 227
a hero because of the 2004 bloody sock game. %$* 227
in politics, let's see about that one. %$* 227
jackie? %$* 227
donald trump has gotten closer and closer to putting his full attack on hillary clinton's marriage. %$* 189
and so far hillary clinton has really taken a step back and has said she's going to take the high ground. %$* 189
but don't expect her super pacs to be as gentle. %$* 189
one of them has told me that they're ready for anything. %$* 189
they're not tipping their hands yet. %$* 189
but i would look to them to do her dirty work should donald trump decide to go after her on that issue. %$* 189
personal versus personal. %$* 53
great. %$* 53
just how we want to end the issues. %$* 53
basic campaign we've been living through here. %$* 53
i'll close with more on the giant questions facing trump and his campaign in this very big week ahead. %$* 53
now the operation has been a mess since the beginning and there are huge tensions now as this giant second debate looms. %$* 53
trump was described as beyond annoyed to hear his campaign manager kellyanne conway said on national television that she had reprimanded trump for criticizing that former miss universe who says trump called her miss piggy and miss housekeeping. %$* 53
then there was another edict from the top campaign staff, the top campaign aides telling him to stop providing source accounts to news organizations about trump's refusal to take debate prep seriously. %$* 53
the promise now is ratchet it all up for the second debate and as the debate session prep -- prep session, excuse me, planned for today even. %$* 53
but several trump allies well aware how important this next week is are worried about two big things. %$* 53
a frustrated and angry candidate and an organization still rich with dysfunctional relationships. %$* 53
let's see how this all turns out. %$* 53
that's it for inside politics. %$* 53
again, thanks for sharing your sunday morning. %$* 53
hope to see you noon eastern each week day for our new daily edition of inside politics and back here live from the debate side of st. louis next sunday. %$* 53
up next, "state of the union" with jake tapper. %$* 53

all right. %$* 141
and make some good memories today. %$* 141
thanks for being with us. %$* 141
inside politics with john king starts right now. %$* 168
donald trump goes birther again, this time on ted cruz. %$* 53
he's got this cloud over his head. %$* 5
cruz calls it silly. %$* 53
the son of a u.s. citizen born abroad is a natural born citizen. %$* 228
three weeks until iowa votes, the trump-cruz bromance is wilting. %$* 53
plus hillary clinton questions whether bernie sanders is up to the challenge. %$* 53
i don't need a tour. %$* 149
i know right where the oval office is. %$* 149
and the president readies his final state of the union address with gun control front and center. %$* 53
every time i think about those kids, it gets me mad. %$* 40
is the obama effect on 2016 a plus or minus for democrats? %$* 53
inside politics -- the biggest stories sourced by the best reporters now. %$* 53
welcome to inside politics. %$* 53
i'm john king. %$* 53
thanks for sharing your sunday morning and it is a busy one. %$* 53
now, just three weeks away from the iowa caucuses in 2016's first official test. %$* 53
here are three big dynamics to watch this week. %$* 53
there's a republican debate thursday night and a showdown between trump and cruz now seems inevitable. %$* 53
trump worried about losing iowa is aggressively stirring talk cruz isn't even eligible to be president because he was born in canada. %$* 53
he was born in canada. %$* 5
whether we like it, don't like it, he lived there. %$* 5
he was there. %$* 5
he was born in canada. %$* 5
you have to be born in the land. %$* 5
that's what i always thought before. %$* 5
ted is very glib and he goes out and he says well, i'm a natural born citizen. %$* 5
the point is you're not. %$* 5
truth is better than fiction. %$* 53
also a democratic race that has been, for the most part, polite is turning more pointed and personal as hillary clinton confronts a strong challenge from bernie sanders. %$* 53
and when it really mattered senator sanders voted with the gun lobby and i voted against the gun lobby. %$* 149
also this week, president obama delivers his final state of the union address -- that's tuesday night. %$* 53
he's looking to shape both his final year in office and the campaign to replace it. %$* 53
issues like licensing registration -- that's an area where there's just not enough national consensus at this stage to even consider it. %$* 40
and part of it is that people's concern that that becomes a prelude to taking people's guns away. %$* 40
i mean part of the challenge in this is that the gun debate gets wrapped up in broader debates about whether the federal government is oppressive. %$* 40
with us this sunday morning to share their reporting and their insights: maggie haberman of the "new york times"; cnn's manu raju; jonathan martin of the "new york times"; and julie pace of the associated press. %$* 53
so trump and cruz -- they say they like each other. %$* 53
donald trump says -- this is my favorite part for the "with friends like these" file at home -- he says he's doing this because he like ted cruz. %$* 53
so the reason he's saying well, he was born in canada, maybe he's not eligible is he likes. %$* 53
no, no. %$* 144
he loves him and they're friends. %$* 144
it's essentially a version of that's a nice citizenship you got there. %$* 144
shame if somebody keeps bringing it up over and over again. %$* 144
trump did four minutes on this in clear lake, iowa last night. %$* 144
clearly donald trump sees movement in iowa. %$* 144
he has seen polls that show him behind cruz, he needs to gain ground. %$* 144
and once again -- this is the brilliance of trump -- he has set the agenda on this for a week. %$* 144
cruz has been on the defensive for a week. %$* 144
cruz tried making a joke about it. %$* 144
he talks about how he was making a joke about it. %$* 144
i posted on twitter about jumping the shark. %$* 144
and then he found himself having to release his mother's birth certificate. %$* 144
so this is not going away. %$* 144
it is sinking in the question. %$* 144
it remains whether trump, i think, is going to go after him in the debate on thursday night. %$* 144
and that's a big open question. %$* 144
trump has often telegraphed punches before him and then not swung through. %$* 144
so we'll see. %$* 144
pulled back in debates and left it out to the campaign trail. %$* 53
it's been an interesting dynamic throughout the campaign. %$* 53
you mentioned the polls. %$* 53
there's no question donald trump is also going after ted cruz on ethanol. %$* 53
if you look at the speech yesterday, he went after cruz consistently and over and over again. %$* 53
the polls tell you why. %$* 53
cruz 27, trump 23, rubio at 15, carson at 9, jeb bush at 7. %$* 1081
but if you're donald trump and your brand is winning -- number one cruz is starting to move in iowa. %$* 1081
we've talked about this for a while. %$* 1081
but number two, if you're trump, you're close enough still. %$* 1081
the idea is keep cruz from growing. %$* 1081
is trump looking for a win or just to keep it close? %$* 1081
he said very plainly himself that he wants to win iowa. %$* 52
he's in battle for trying to win there. %$* 52
i think that's why he's going after cruz so aggressively. %$* 52
if he was playing for second place, i don't think he would have shown up yesterday in iowa and taking on a meat cleaver to ted cruz about ethanol and the issue about his birthplace. %$* 52
the fact is that ted cruz is now facing a real threat from donald trump and these two are going to go at it this week. %$* 52
i think trump -- looking at those poll numbers is going to -- finally have to bring himself to confronting ted cruz in person which he has not done yet. %$* 52
keep in mind at the last debate in december maggie had the story about ted cruz behind closed doors talking about trump. %$* 52
and trump was tempted but he couldn't bring himself to do it. %$* 52
trump has finally found %$* 238
something to go after ted cruz. %$* 238
remember he tried to, you know, raise questions about his being evangelical. %$* 238
there are not many evangelicals who came from cuba -- kind of a questionable attack. %$* 238
he also said that he acted kind of crazy in the senate. %$* 238
when he did that he got blowback, yes, he got blowback from conservative talk radio. %$* 238
rush limbaugh said what are you doing? %$* 238
of course, that's great, you should be doing it. %$* 238
and now, finally on the ethanol and the canada thing you see it's getting some traction -- i'm sure he's going to continue to push that this week. %$* 238
to maggie's point this is the brilliance of donald trump. %$* 170
he actually throws a lot of things against the wall. %$* 170
he gives these long speeches and there are tons of things he says about his rivals that don't always get a lot of attention. %$* 170
but he waits to find the one thing that does. %$* 170
and once it connects he'll hit it over and over again. %$* 170
and because cruz -- i was joking before the show, he's the meghan trainor of this race. %$* 53
he's all about the base. %$* 53
and when he gives things like "i'll investigate planned parenthood on day one" -- you know, everything he does is to drive out the conservative evangelical and tea party base in iowa. %$* 53
now trump has him talking about something else. %$* 53
trump is at least taking part of cruz's every day to deal with this issue. %$* 53
although cruz did gently -- again he'll say he was asked a question -- but he did go after trump on immigration this past week where he said donald trump says those who came into the country illegally can leave and then come back. %$* 53
ted cruz says "i won't let them back in." %$* 53
so we do see that both men understand who the biggest threat in iowa is. %$* 53
cruz is starting to draw those subtle distinctions. %$* 146
he said that well, look i'm not, you know -- to run a campaign in iowa you need to actually do a lot of campaigning, grassroots campaigning. %$* 146
you can't do this from a tv studio in manhattan -- trying to draw that subtle distinction. %$* 146
now, on immigration cruz has actually shifted to the right of trump. %$* 146
i mean cruz actually had a much more moderate line, particularly on legal immigration during that 2013 debate in the senate. %$* 146
trump has tried to take a hard line on immigration, cruz moving to the right -- clearly obviously sees an opportunity to expose just a little bit of vulnerability on trump's right. %$* 146
the risk, i think, is more in style as opposed to substance on this. %$* 144
i mean the risk is both. %$* 144
but if you're cruz not going with a meat cleaver back at trump will help you in iowa. %$* 144
the question is what happens after iowa? %$* 144
if trump keeps this close in iowa and trump then wins new hampshire, this election, a lot of it right now is about strength. %$* 144
we don't know what is going to be happening with national security in the coming months. %$* 144
and so if you're cruz there's a risk of looking like you're not punching back hard enough and defending yourself. %$* 144
and i don't know how that's going to go. %$* 144
i think that's a great point because that has been part of what people say is a christie movement in new hampshire, too where he realizes voters aren't looking for ideology yet, at least in the republican primary. %$* 53
they're looking for strength. %$* 53
they're looking for toughness. %$* 53
they're looking for tough talk. %$* 53
i'll beat hillary clinton. %$* 53
i'll be tough against terrorism. %$* 53
the fascinating part, we're talking about cruz and trump -- no question they're at the top of the pack right now for republicans. %$* 53
and the establishment is a little -- more than a little nervous about this. %$* 53
in your piece today you said that even michael bloomberg is thinking "this is all going to fracture and maybe i'll poll  and jump in as an independent." %$* 53
the subplot is who, if anyone emerges as the establishment candidate? %$* 53
and here's just a little bit. %$* 53
you have john kasich in this lane. %$* 53
you have jeb bush in this lane. %$* 53
but chris christie and marco rubio having a little "hello". %$* 53
this guy has been spoon-fed every victory he's ever had in his life. %$* 192
that's the kind of person that we want to put on the stage against hillary clinton? %$* 192
i don't think so. %$* 192
so pat him on the head and then cut his heart out. %$* 192
chris has a very liberal record for a republican. %$* 195
he personally gave a contribution to planned parenthood. %$* 195
so i'm sure he doesn't really want to have a conversation about the issues. %$* 195
if trump-cruz is the heavyweight fight, the undercard is kind of interesting. %$* 53
yes. %$* 170
it's a great debate between the two of them in new hampshire, in particular because i think voters in new hampshire want to like marco rubio. %$* 170
they really do. %$* 170
they just haven't made the decision that they're going to go in his direction. %$* 170
and christie has seized on that opening. %$* 170
and i was in iowa last week, and i have to tell you, christie is benefitting there from the free media he's getting in new hampshire. %$* 170
he's not going to win iowa by any means. %$* 170
but there's something happening where christie is getting a second look from a lot of voters who maybe had wanted to move toward rubio and just didn't see the opportunity to do so. %$* 170
and if you're marco rubio, you need to end up having a good third place in iowa to take you into new hampshire. %$* 146
if you lose to chris christie in new hampshire come third or fourth then that is detrimental to his campaign going into south carolina. %$* 146
martin:  there's no question that rubio needs to be the sort of top %$* 146
establishment candidate in iowa and then probably new hampshire, too to have a case to make going into south carolina after you've got cruz and trump, potentially one of the first  to say guys, it's my turn. %$* 146
come on board. %$* 146
but just real fast on christie's comment about rubio. %$* 146
it's actually not fair to rubio because he did have a really tough campaign in 2010. %$* 146
he has had a real race. %$* 146
he beat a sitting governor of a state. %$* 146
so it's not totally right about rubio. %$* 146
but listen to rubio. %$* 146
he's turning his  into campaigns. %$* 53
listen to rubio's comments there where he's having to invoke a chris christie contribution to planned parenthood -- classic oppo drop at a presser. %$* 52
i think back to the debate in boulder, colorado in october and rubio saying to jeb bush you're saying that because somebody told you it would help your campaign. %$* 52
i'm not in this campaign to attack somebody else. %$* 52
i mean how far have we come from that moment? %$* 52
right. %$* 53
survival. %$* 53
christie's now using that line against rubio -- %$* 144
right. %$* 52
-- i mean it is true -- i mean i think that you're seeing christie and you're seeing cruz have both -- and rubio has wandered into fights with both of them now. %$* 144
and both are trying to sort of move in for the kill and suggest that rubio is not strong enough -- not able to have this kind of a fight. %$* 144
and to jonathan's point rubio did have a tough fight in 2010. %$* 144
i think it's going to be interesting to see how this plays out again at the debate. %$* 144
both of them have been telegraphing punches to rubio for two weeks now, three weeks now. %$* 144
when jeb bush did that, rubio knew exactly how to throw up a block. %$* 144
and so i think there is a real chance. %$* 144
i'm assuming christie is just going to lunge for rubio on thursday but i think that there is -- i'm sorry -- but i think that there is a more than good chance that rubio is going to have a pretty good response. %$* 144
well that's, i mean in this reality tv campaign we've had among those establish candidates this is survivor -- who gets to stay as we go on? %$* 53
yes, right. %$* 52
everybody sit tight. %$* 53
up next: some 2008 deja vu including bill clinton on the trail trying to help his wife close the sale. %$* 53
first though, politicians say the darnedest things. %$* 53
remember how barney-cam made the first dog seem so cute and lovable back in the george w. bush days? %$* 53
well, jeb bush says it was all an act. %$* 53
can i tell you the truth about barney? %$* 161
no, i want to know. %$* 22
he's a mean little dog. %$* 161
barney loves the president. %$* 161
barney loved w.  he just didn't love me or anybody else. %$* 161
welcome back. %$* 53
the democratic race is testy, too as hillary clinton and bernie sanders engage in what you might call a little point, counter point. %$* 53
think hard about the people who are presenting themselves to you -- their experience, their qualifications, their positions. %$* 149
and particularly for those of us who are democrats, their electability. %$* 149
any objective person would assess that the new energy in this campaign from young people, from working class people is with our campaign not secretary clinton's campaign. %$* 128
i'm a progressive who likes to get things done. %$* 149
and i will get into that white house. %$* 149
i don't need a tour. %$* 149
i know where the oval office is. %$* 149
we're going to need a candidate who can bring out millions and millions of people who in many cases have given up on the political process. %$* 128
and frankly, i think our campaign is the campaign to do that. %$* 128
interesting -- and we were talking about this before the show, i mean "i don't need a tour. %$* 53
i'm more electable." %$* 53
she tried that against a guy named barack obama in 2008 and it didn't work. %$* 53
is this just her dna and this is what she wants to say or do think somehow because sanders is not a young guy like obama then it's more effective? %$* 53
i think yes to all of that. %$* 144
i think it's some combination. %$* 144
but as i was listening to that i was thinking my time machine is working and i'm in 2008. %$* 144
raju:  you're going to rewrite the same stories you did in '08. %$* 144
exactly. %$* 144
look, i mean again, to that point of sort reading the stage directions. %$* 144
you can talk about electability without saying i don't need a tour of the white house. %$* 144
and that is a clear way to remind voters that you have been there before, all of your experience and then all of the accompanying baggage. %$* 144
my take away -- i don't know exactly what is going on -- but my clear take away is that the clinton campaign is concerned about a tightening either in new hampshire, or in iowa or both. %$* 144
i mean new hampshire, sanders has had a lead there for awhile. %$* 144
so i have to assume it's iowa. %$* 144
she called in to a cable show on friday -- on a friday evening by phone to criticize sanders on guns. %$* 144
it was trumpesque to do the phoning in. %$* 144
it was trumpesque to do the sort of responding and seizing in for the kill. %$* 144
they're all frankly imitating trump in one way or another. %$* 144
sanders is, too to a large extent -- or to a medium extent. %$* 144
but there is clear concern that sanders is on the move. %$* 144
i think that a couple of weeks ago when you had that dnc data breach that was supposed to blow back on sanders' campaign terrible and sanders campaign folks did do something wrong. %$* 144
i think at the end of the day, that ended up, they so successfully flipped the script that i think that they have so energized their supporters and again in a trump way. %$* 144
the establishment is trying to hurt me. %$* 144
facts be damned. %$* 144
you come rally to my side -- and i think that is a lot of what's going on. %$* 144
another sign team clinton is nervous is that bill clinton is out on the campaign trail. %$* 53
they understand this. %$* 53
they understand he's an asset in many ways but he also is a potential liability in many other ways. %$* 53
and so they know if you let him out you have to deal with both. %$* 53
and so he's out which means they understand they need him. %$* 53
they need him to try to close the sale. %$* 53
he was asked about it, because republicans are stirring from trump on down, stirring up bill clinton -- she can't criticize on women's issues if bill clinton's is out there. %$* 53
they want to talk about more sordid things in his past. %$* 53
he didn't want to answer it directly when he's in new hampshire. %$* 53
but a voter asked bernie sanders about it at a rally. %$* 53
listen. %$* 53
hillary clinton is not bill clinton. %$* 128
what bill clinton did, i think, we can all acknowledge was totally, totally, totally disgraceful and unacceptable. %$* 128
but i'm running against hillary clinton. %$* 128
i'm not running against bill clinton. %$* 128
it's -- now it's in the -- that's the democratic race. %$* 53
pace:  i was out at bill clinton's events in iowa last week and you %$* 53
saw both the good and the not so good of bill clinton. %$* 53
he had 500 people each at his events which is more than you get at some republican candidates' events in iowa. %$* 53
he had the crowd going. %$* 53
he had the great applause lines. %$* 53
but also he got confronted by reporters about the trump criticism and it's going to trail him everywhere that he goes. %$* 53
but you know that the clinton campaign at this point sees it as more of a positive than a negative because of what i think maggie is saying that there's something they going on that they feel like whatever he can bring to the table to help her at this point they need. %$* 53
in a lot of ways it feels a lot like '08, right after obama won in iowa. %$* 52
and it looked like he was going to run away with the nomination and then hillary clinton comes and wins in new hampshire and kept the campaign alive for months. %$* 52
i think the real concern for the hillary campaign is if bernie does really well in those first two states he will have -- he will be in a pretty strong position for the rest of the campaign. %$* 52
and it will reinforce the narrative that the democratic base is just not excited about her headed into a general. %$* 52
and that's the issue. %$* 52
look, there's no question that the clinton campaign is concerned about iowa tightening. %$* 52
new hampshire is clearly now favoring bernie sanders. %$* 52
the question is only how much. %$* 52
it's the calendar. %$* 52
it's january 10th, and she has every conceivable advantage at her side. %$* 52
she's struggling to fend off somebody who is a 74-year-old, you know, self-avowed socialist who is largely seen by most democrats as a kind of message candidate. %$* 52
and she can't fend him off in the first two states? %$* 52
that's troubling for them. %$* 52
i think that's why you're seeing her turning the guns much more aggressively now. %$* 52
lastly and quickly -- what about the obama effect. %$* 53
the president gives his last state of the union address tuesday night. %$* 53
he is the incumbent president. %$* 53
the democratic base is still a fan of barack obama even if some of the rest of the country may have tuned out. %$* 53
how much of this speech tuesday night is here is what i've done. %$* 53
look at me. %$* 53
here is my legacy. %$* 53
and how much of this is as you replace me, think about this? %$* 53
i think it's much more the latter. %$* 170
i mean the fact that the speech is happening earlier than a state of the union normally would is part of the president trying to put his stamp on this caucus and new hampshire primary process. %$* 170
he's going to frame the speech around where the country should go after his presidency. %$* 170
he may not say directly you should vote for a democrat -- certainly he won't say a specific democrat. %$* 170
didn't he almost say at his town hall you should vote for hillary clinton because i'm not going to campaign for anyone who's been against me on guns? %$* 53
that's what the clinton campaign wants you to say -- for sure. %$* 170
and bernie has been against that. %$* 53
i think that's -- to your point that the sanders can play the "if the fix is in" part of it. %$* 53
and the focus by itself on the issue by obama while she's hitting bernie. %$* 52
it's actually great politics for her, too because he draws media attention to it, at the same time. %$* 52
look, real fast the question is if she loses iowa and new hampshire, does she need the obama endorsement to come in the primaries? %$* 52
we got a few weeks before we may be posing that question. %$* 53
everybody -- thank you. %$* 53
up next our reporters share from their notebooks including a date that senator rand paul and the rest of us, well, we better mark on our calendars. %$* 53
let's head around the inside politics table so our great reporters can get you out ahead of the big stories just around the corner. %$* 53
maggie haberman. %$* 53
bernie sanders team and their allies were very taken aback by how hard they got hit by the white house and by hillary clinton on guns last week. %$* 144
they believe this could provide them a moment where their supporters are going to get angry at the establishment again, just like we saw with this data breach and provide them something of a lift. %$* 144
and it's possible it could cauterize some of the wounds that you might be seeing otherwise. %$* 144
hillary clinton has telegraphed very clearly she is going to keep hitting him hard on this. %$* 144
this is going to be an issue in the debate. %$* 144
they believe they can get some kind of support from their followers that will inoculate them. %$* 144
fascinating to watch and she's clearly nervous. %$* 53
manu. %$* 53
rand paul -- remember him, john? %$* 146
i do. %$* 53
january 26 is a big deadline for rand and it's not because there's a primary that night. %$* 146
it's because that is the filing deadline in kentucky for candidates to run against him in the senate race this year. %$* 146
now, democrats will have a hard time winning that seat given how red kentucky has gotten. %$* 146
but they believe they can mount a challenge to him because rand, has of course, focused on his the national ambitions and sort of ignored kentucky over the last year or so. %$* 146
jim grey the lexington mayor is publicly considering a run. %$* 146
and it will be interesting to see who else gets in that race. %$* 146
that will be very instructive in telling us when rand will get out of the presidential race. %$* 146
if he has a tough race back home for senate, maybe he gets out earlier than anticipated. %$* 146
march 6 is the big day for rand paul -- that's when the kentucky caucus is to choose a presidential nominee in that state and of course, he was instrumental in changing that from a primary to a caucus so he could run for both of offices at the same time. %$* 146
this really shows you john just how much things have changed for rand in the past year. %$* 146
as they say and say and say "all politics is local". %$* 53
jonathan. %$* 53
john -- ted cruz is entering a phase of the campaign that he has not been in yet, which is one with a big target on his back. %$* 52
now he rolls just being the sort of whipping boy of the washington establishment. %$* 52
but now the person going after him is far from the establishment. %$* 52
in fact, it's the only person in the campaign who's more anti-establishment than him. %$* 52
it's donald trump. %$* 52
trump is going after cruz with the most personal of reasons questioning cruz's birthplace. %$* 52
watch this week to see how cruz responds. %$* 52
his campaign does have a kind of one-page talking point document that they're circulating now amongst some other allies that explains exactly why he is, in fact, eligible for the presidency. %$* 52
his mom, of course, was born and raised in delaware. %$* 52
so the fact that she was in canada when he was born he argues is not relevant. %$* 52
this is a real fascinating test for cruz. %$* 52
i'm curious to see if those kind of talking points wind up either in some kind of a paid media mail piece in iowa here in the next week or so. %$* 52
a good question of how bad is the bleeding, i guess. %$* 53
julie. %$* 53
one of the ways that people are trying to discern if donald trump has a ground game in iowa is through new voter registrations in the state, the theory being that some of his support is from coming from people who haven't caucused before. %$* 170
but rival campaigns that i talked to last week in iowa say that's a faulty metric at this point. %$* 170
they're operating under the assumption that if cruz does have -- or if trump does have a ground game what they're doing is recommending that people register the night of the caucus. %$* 170
after all it's a lot easier to get people who haven't participated before to participate once as opposed to taking two different steps. %$* 170
fascinating item to watch. %$* 1082
i'll close with a nostalgic and i think a telling trip down memory lane. %$* 1082

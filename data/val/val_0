change is coming to the u.s. supreme court. %$* 116
justice sandra day o'connor announces her retirement. %$* 116
and the battle over her successor officially begins. %$* 116
the nation deserves and i will select a supreme court justice that americans can be proud of. %$* 161
i hope the president will select someone who meets the high standards that she set. %$* 324
and that can bring the nation together. %$* 324
the war rooms, the ad makers and the attack lines are ready. %$* 116
we'll hear from both sides of the unfolding fight. %$* 116
and we'll review possible contenders for o'connor's job and the baggage they might bring with them. %$* 116
a voice of moderation and at times modesty. %$* 579
i've never looked upon myself or the role of the court as being all powerful. %$* 580
we'll look back at justice o'connor's remarkable career. %$* 116
and her one on one interview with judy woodruff. %$* 116
now live from washington, cnn's inside politics. %$* 116
well thanks for joining us. %$* 307
i'm suzanne malveaux. %$* 307
in some ways, justice sandra day o'connor's retirement is even more pivotal and potentially polarizing than if chief justice william rehnquist had made the announcement today. %$* 307
she is not only the first woman to serve on the high court, but she's also something of a wild card, a moderate conservative who sometimes unpredictable votes have been the deciding factor in major court rulings. %$* 307
that may raise the stakes for political figure on the left and on the right who have been preparing for a supreme court battle for months. %$* 307
well, suzanne, as you well know, president bush has had his aides preparing for this very day for four-and-a-half years since day one of this administration. %$* 581
associates in the legal council's office have been digging through old writings and rulings of any potential nominee that could be put up to replace any retiring justice. %$* 581
but, of course, today came and president bush did come into the rose garden for the moment that he was waiting for. %$* 581
and he did try to make today, though, only about justice o'connor. %$* 581
the white house made it very clear early that he was not going to name a potential replacement now. %$* 581
in fact, we are told he's not going to do so until he returns from a trip to europe. %$* 581
that is -- that means we won't see anything until at least a week from today. %$* 581
but mr. bush did come out and explain his process in the rose garden. %$* 581
under the constitution, i am responsible for nominating a successor to justice o'connor. %$* 161
i take this responsibility seriously. %$* 161
i will be deliberate and thorough in this process. %$* 161
now, mr. bush also did try to explain, or at least send word to congress, that he very much understands the atmosphere that we are in right now, the partisan atmosphere that we are in. %$* 32
and he made clear that he wants this process to be a calm, and he said whatever nominee he puts up, to be treated with dignity. %$* 32
the nation deserves and i will select a supreme court justice that americans can be proud of. %$* 161
the nation also deserves a dignified process of confirmation in the united states senate, characterized by fair treatment, a fair hearing and a fair vote. %$* 161
i will choose a nominee in a timely manner so that the hearing and the vote can be completed before the new supreme court term begins. %$* 161
now, the president there talking about working with the senate. %$* 32
the white house says that president bush did call the majority leader bill frist shortly after talking with sandra day o'connor to talk about the process moving forward. %$* 32
they also said that mr. bush did talk to the democratic leader harry reid when he was here at the white house earlier this week for a breakfast and the white house is promising that the president will reach out to the leading democrat as well as republican in the near future on the judiciary committee, of course, the committee that will be leading up the confirmation process of whatever nominee he puts up. %$* 32
and dana, i know this was really an extraordinary exciting day for both of us, of course, being in washington and covering politics so closely. %$* 307
i was driving into work as you know about 9:30 in the morning. %$* 307
and i got a call on my cell phone from an insider at the supreme court an inside source, who said that sandra day o'connor had just distributed letters to her fellow justices announcing her retirement at 9:15 in the morning. %$* 307
it was just 15 minutes after that had happen. %$* 307
of course, all of us were scrambling at that point. %$* 307
we were getting hundreds of e-mails and phone calls. %$* 307
what was it like for you and for the president as it all unfolded this morning? %$* 307
well, suzanne, you are right. %$* 32
when we got that phone call, we immediately were calling sources here. %$* 32
and as you know, when you don't get calls back and there is sort of the sound of silence something is definitely going on. %$* 32
and some folks here said they had heard the rumors as well. %$* 32
here outside the press office, we were sort of waiting to see what would happen. %$* 32
and then, suddenly the door closed towards the oval office. %$* 32
we saw the white house photographer come running up the stairs. %$* 32
clear that he wanted to capture a moment in history. %$* 32
and that's exactly what happened. %$* 32
and i'll give you the brief ticktock from the white house of how they learned about it. %$* 32
it was yesterday, actually, just before lunchtime that the head marshal at the supreme court sent word, actually called the white house counsel here, harriet myers, and said that there was going to be a letter coming to the white house today. %$* 32
didn't say from whom, but just asked if the timing would be ok.  and harriet myers it was clear there was going to be some kind of retirement today, but they didn't know who. %$* 32
00 a.m. that they got word here at the white house from the supreme court that it actually was a letter from justice o'connor that president bush was going to be getting. %$* 582
so the president then did talk to justice o'connor on the phone shortly after getting her letter. %$* 582
we are told that he -- it was a very emotional phone call. %$* 582
he even said that he wished he could hug her. %$* 582
justice o'connor is from texas. %$* 582
he had a line saying that for an old ranching girl, you turned out pretty good. %$* 582
that's pretty good. %$* 307
and dana, of course, i know this is probably going to ruin your weekend, my holiday weekend, many other people as well. %$* 307
it's going to be a very busy summer. %$* 307
thank you so much, dana, for your report. %$* 307
now, like president bush, of course, many senators stepped forward today to praise justice o'connor and to lay down markers for the confirmation hearings ahead. %$* 307
now, let's go to capitol hill and our congressional correspondent ed henry -- ed. %$* 307
good afternoon, suzanne. %$* 308
that's right, talk about canceled weekend plans. %$* 308
the senate on friday afternoon usually is very, very quiet, especially on the eve of the 4th much july holiday, but a lot of those plans are being canceled. %$* 308
very high level meetings going on. %$* 308
both sides drawing the battle lines. %$* 308
you can just feel the electricity in the air up here. %$* 308
that in fact, they are -- both sides now preparing for the mother of all confirmation battles. %$* 308
the kind of battle that both sides think could actually make the clarence thomas or robert bork confirmation hearings look like child's play. %$* 308
in fact, senate majority leader bill frist as you just heard dana mention, got that call from president bush and moved quickly today to say that he and senate judiciary chairman arlen specter will in fact have a very speedy, quick process, as soon as they get the word from the white house as early as late next week, about who their pick will be. %$* 308
on the democratic side, they are also moving very quickly. %$* 308
senate democratic leader harry reid today demanding that the president in fact take the advise and consent provisions of the constitution seriously, reach out and consult with democrats. %$* 308
and what you are seeing democrats do as well is very quickly unveil a strategy of endless praise of sandra day o'connor saying over and over she's a moderate, she's mainstream, moderate, mainstream. %$* 308
again and again at one press conference after another. %$* 308
what they are trying to hammer home is their belief that in fact her seat on the court should stay in the center. %$* 308
they are trying to box the president in and force him to pick someone who is moderate. %$* 308
here is senator christopher dodd. %$* 308
this is a conservative president. %$* 516
what we're suggesting, i hope we are, is that this president ought to use the reagan standard in choosing a nominee. %$* 516
someone who would enjoy the kind of support that sandra day o'connor did in the early days of the reagan administration. %$* 516
now, both sides also say that while the battle would have been fierce if chief justice william rehnquist had stepped down as a lot of speculation had been in recent days, they say it will be an even more bitter fight with sandra day o'connor stepping down because it's such a swing seat. %$* 308
and this could be the tipping point on a lot of those 5-4 decisions on issues like affirmative action, abortion. %$* 308
and the man in the middle who will have to deal with trying to calm both sides down is senator arlen specter, the judiciary chairman. %$* 308
this is a very polarized country when it comes to the issues which will come to the supreme court of the united states. %$* 309
and i would expect people to want their choice. %$* 309
everybody can't have their own way. %$* 309
that's why we have a president. %$* 309
and that's why we have a senate. %$* 309
now, arlen specter today said he hopes to provide that kind of balance with his confirmation hearings. %$* 308
he says he does not expect a filibuster of this nomination. %$* 308
in fact, he believes it will be some sort of a consensus choice that will not be filibustered on the senate floor. %$* 308
but while the judiciary committee will be holding these confirmation hearings, a lot of people on both sides noting that the real power in this process, instead, could be the so-called gang of 14 moderates who averted that nuclear showdown last week on lower court judicial nominations and now may exert a lot of power. %$* 308
seven moderate democrats, even moderate republicans, as well. %$* 308
one of them, john warner of virginia, who just came out a short while ago and told reporters he thinks the president has a real opportunity here to be a uniter and not a divider. %$* 308
and people are saying that perhaps this gang of 14 could be prodding the president, maybe be almost a shadow judiciary committee -- suzanne. %$* 308
ed, it will be very interesting to see how all of that plays out. %$* 307
thank you very much, ed henry, for your report. %$* 307
now, the politics of nominating and confirming a new supreme court justice is not entirely clear cut. %$* 307
new poll numbers out today make that point. %$* 307
65 percent of those surveyed say they want a new supreme justice who would uphold the roe v.  wade decision legalizing abortion. %$* 307
but at the same time, 41 percent of those polls say they want a new justice who would make the court more conservative. %$* 307
and that is a new sign that americans are thinking about more than abortion when they consider the makeup of the high court. %$* 307
now senator ed kennedy is urging the president to choose a supreme court nominee who will bring the nation together. %$* 307
as a member of the judiciary committee, the massachusetts democrat will play an important role in the confirmation hearings. %$* 307
i spoke with him today in an exclusive interview and asked him more about what kind of justice he is looking for to replace o'connor. %$* 307
well, when you mention her name, a number of thoughts come to mind. %$* 324
first of all of her extraordinary contribution to the court and to our country. %$* 324
and i think all americans take their hat off to sandra day o'connor for really a brilliant service. %$* 324
i didn't always agree with every opinion, but it was a remarkable career. %$* 324
i think of that. %$* 324
secondly, i also think of how she came to the court and what the reaction to the united states senate. %$* 324
i think of really the extraordinary conservative leader that ronald reagan was. %$* 324
he is mr. conservative, and yet he nominated someone to the court that brought the senate of the united states together. %$* 324
she was approved unanimously. %$* 324
here was someone that really understood the importance of right after the 1980 elections to bring the nation together on consensus candidate who turned about to be an outstanding leader. %$* 324
and i'm very hopeful that this president will consult with the leaders, republican and democrats, as president clinton did with his nominees, and that we would have a positive experience in the senate. %$* 324
now, you've already written a letter. %$* 307
you sent a letter to president bush asking for consultation on this process. %$* 307
what have you heard back from the white house? %$* 307
do you expect that the president will consult with democrats? %$* 307
are you satisfied with what you've heard so far? %$* 307
no, there's been no indication or willingness to do that. %$* 324
i think in the letter that was signed by all but one member of the minority -- and senator byrd sent his own letter to the president, was asking for a consultation. %$* 324
different presidents have used different ways of consulting. %$* 324
but i think, as people know, president clinton had a very formal sort of process and talked with orrin hatch, who was chairman of the judiciary. %$* 324
in senator hatch's book, he describes in great detail the consultation and how he valued it. %$* 324
we'd like a similar kind of experience with republican leaders and democratic leaders. %$* 324
now senator harry reid has already offered some names, republican names, as possible nominees to the white house. %$* 307
are you willing to actually offer some names to the president? %$* 307
and do you expect that he will reciprocate that, as well? %$* 307
i think there are scores of well-qualified republican, both judges, members of the bar, academicians... %$* 324
now,  with the supreme court battle lines drawn, we'll get a republican take on who president bush should nominate from senator john cornyn. %$* 307
also ahead, the interest groups ready for an all-out war. %$* 307
we'll hear from advocates on the left and right and see if they can find any common ground. %$* 307
plus, the court of public opinion. %$* 307
our bill schneider will have more on our new supreme court polls and the possibility of a litmus test for the president's nominee. %$* 307
now, even before today's announcements, interest groups on both the right and left were mobilizing for battles over potential supreme court vacancies. %$* 307
with me now to talk about the confirmation showdowns that could lie head are ralph neas, the president of people for the american way and ben ginsberg, legal adviser to the group progress for america. %$* 307
i assume that your vacations have been ruined at this point. %$* 307
we have all very, very busy summers right here. %$* 307
but let's get right down to it. %$* 307
of course, sandra day o'connor ruled on some issues that both conservatives, as well as liberals, did not like. %$* 307
of course, we are going to continue to see some of that, as well. %$* 307
now, is it likely that there is going to be a consensus nominee here? %$* 307
is the president likely to go ahead and reach out and consult? %$* 307
is there any benefit to that? %$* 307
we'll start with you. %$* 307
i hope and pray that president bush will sit down with democratic senators and republican senators and consult, but not just consult, work out a bipartisan consensus so that we can have a unity nominee, someone who would bring the country together. %$* 415
especially now when we're at a time of war, when we have so many domestic and international challenges. %$* 415
this is the time to get someone democrats and republicans and can support. %$* 415
in fact, someone that every american can support. %$* 415
ben, are you hearing anything from the white house, from advisers that are close to the president, that, in fact, that is what he intends to do? %$* 307
well, the president said today in his address in the rose garden that he was going to consult and seek the advice of members of the senate, both democrat and republicans alike. %$* 583
it's an important thing to do and the president will do that. %$* 583
how important is that, however, you have -- he has a choice here where he can either build consensus or he can basically serve his base, his conservative base. %$* 307
and there's some people who are watching this process and say, he really doesn't need to reach out to democrats. %$* 307
that this is the time, really, to change the ideological bent of the supreme court. %$* 307
that is a critical moment for the administration. %$* 307
this is a watershed moment for the country and for the constitution. %$* 415
i wish i was confident that president bush would reach out. %$* 415
i don't think he is. %$* 415
he's always chosen confrontation over collaboration. %$* 415
he always has stuck his finger in the eyes of the democrats. %$* 415
i'm afraid that he will choose someone in the mode of thomas and scalia. %$* 415
if he does that, he replaces a moderate conservative like sandra day o'connor with a right-wing justice. %$* 415
at stake would be supreme court precedents going back 70 years, protecting the environment, protecting reproductive right and privacy, protecting civil rights, protecting what has really been a second american revolution over the last 70 years. %$* 415
now, today has been a very unique day, because in a way, we have heard from both liberal and conservative groups, both quick to praise his supreme court nominee. %$* 307
of course, sandra o'connor, the retirement, but then, with the fight over president bush's judicial nominees being so incredibly bitter, some saying that this was really just a dress rehearsal for what we are going to see this summer. %$* 307
what do we anticipate here? %$* 307
well, what we anticipate is that the president is going to go through a process in which he's going to judge the merits of the nominee. %$* 583
and he will pick of somebody of the highest judicial qualities to fulfill that role. %$* 583
this is really a day to give praise and credit to justice o'connor and the remarkable career that she had and the impact that she made on this country. %$* 583
i'm not sure, ralph, that it's the time to be hyping up the rhetoric already. %$* 583
although it's true that if you go back and notice what the left and ralph and his allies have done in the thomas and bork nominations 11 years ago, that sort of rhetoric is part and parcel of it. %$* 583
and we hope that this nominee who i'm confident is going to be of the highest judicial qualities will not be tar and feathered as nominees in the past have by the left. %$* 583
that's the way you reach consensus. %$* 583
what about that rhetoric, ben? %$* 415
no, i think that the confirmation battles in the past have been fought in the main over the judicial philosophy of the nominee. %$* 415
obviously, the clarence thomas nomination was an exception to the rule, but that had nothing to do with the advocacy organizations on either side of the issue. %$* 415
we all want, i hope, a consensus choice. %$* 415
i think i started out saying i hope and pray that we can all work together. %$* 415
but i think the past is prologue. %$* 415
and i think we have to take seriously george w. bush's record. %$* 415
and if he does appoint someone in the mode of thomas and scalia, it would be a constitutional catastrophe. %$* 415
it's one thing to look at the past here -- i'll let you respond to that. %$* 307
but it's one thing to look at the past, but if we look at the present here and the future this is going to be a very different process. %$* 307
we are talking about 24-hour cable which did not exist the last time around. %$* 307
we're talking about the internet, about the blogs. %$* 307
i mean this is extraordinary, even just the pace of information. %$* 307
we have all been getting hundreds of e-mails today. %$* 307
how is that going to impact the pace of the pace of the administration moving forward with a nomination. %$* 307
and just how bitter this battle is going to be between your two groups? %$* 307
well, the administration is going to move forward at a pace in which they are confident they have a nominee who will be supported by the american public and the united states senate. %$* 583
now, the pace that you talk about with cable tv is absolutely true. %$* 583
the direct mail fundraising and the e-mails that are going out in massive quantities already with some of that over heated rhetoric, ralph, has already started. %$* 583
and you guys did a great job of hitting the button. %$* 583
we certainly have communicated with over a million of our members and supporters across the country asking them to remember what is at stake. %$* 415
but most importantly, to contact the president and the their two senators and say let's work this out in a bipartisan way. %$* 415
let's get a consensus candidate before the senate. %$* 415
the senate, i think, will be balanced in terms of making sure that the processes are fair. %$* 415
ok. %$* 307
thank you very much. %$* 307
ralph neas and ben ginsberg. %$* 307
i'm sure we'll hear from both of you plenty this summer. %$* 307
thanks again. %$* 307
appreciate it. %$* 307
much more ahead on the debate over who should replace sandra day o'connor. %$* 307
our bill schneider has been checking the polls. %$* 307
and he'll tell us where the american people stand on contentious issues that often come before the court. %$* 307
there's really only one big story in washington today. %$* 307
and we have just begun to tell it. %$* 307
much more ahead on justice sandra day o'connor's retirement and the unfolding battle over her successor. %$* 307
will public opinion figure into president bush's high court choice? %$* 307
with the future tilt of the court on the line, we'll examine the polls, get more partisan reaction on the hill, on the blogs and in our "strategy session." %$* 307
stay with us. %$* 307
as the markets get set to close on wall street, i am joined by kitty pilgrim in new york with "the dobbs report" -- kitty? %$* 307
hi, suzanne, thanks. %$* 315
we'll take a look at the dow to start. %$* 315
the dow industrials are up. %$* 315
they're up not much, though, 34 points. %$* 315
nasdaq virtually unchanged. %$* 315
oil jumped $2 a barrel, back above $59 a barrel. %$* 315
and by the way, the market is closed monday for the holiday. %$* 315
gm's employee discount incentive program really paid off for the carmaker. %$* 315
last month sales soared by 41 percent. %$* 315
but ford sales fell 2.5 percent in june. %$* 315
and that is despite strong demand for the new mustang. %$* 315
and chrysler sales edged up 1 percent. %$* 315
now, microsoft and ibm have settled a long running anti-trust case. %$* 315
microsoft agreed to pay $775 million in cash, $75 million in credit for software to ibm. %$* 315
microsoft has spent more than $4 billion in recent years settling lawsuits, and there are still other suits pending. %$* 315
00 p.m. eastern on "lou dobbs tonight," lots more on the resignation of supreme court justice sandra day o'connor and the potential fight over her successor. %$* 584
also, red star rising. %$* 584
china declares new solidarity with russia, warning other nations not to dominate global affairs. %$* 584
00 p.m. eastern on "lou dobbs tonight." %$* 316
but for now, back to suzanne. %$* 316
well, thanks, kitty. %$* 307
and now back to inside politics. %$* 307
all the kind words we're hearing today about justice sandra day o'connor could offer a stark contrast to the partisan reviews of her successor, whomever that may be. %$* 307
the first woman on the supreme court, a frequent swing vote in major decisions, today revealed her plans to retire. %$* 307
the 75-year-old o'connor spoke with president bush on the phone after sending him a letter saying, "this is to inform you of my decision to retire from my position as an associate justice of the supreme court of the united states, effective upon the nomination and confirmation of my successor." %$* 307
now it's up to the president to name a high court nominee, the first in over a decade, knowing his choice could face fierce attacks from the right or the left. %$* 307
the nation deserves, and i will select, a supreme court justice that americans can be proud of. %$* 161
the nation also deserves a dignified process of confirmation in the united states senate characterized by fair treatment, a fair hearing, and a fair vote. %$* 161
i will choose a nominee in a timely manner so that the hearing and the vote can be completed before the new supreme court term begins. %$* 161
as senate minority leader harry reid says he has talked with the president on the phone since word broke of o'connor's retirement. %$* 307
he says mr. bush expects to name a new supreme court nominee in a week or so. %$* 307
speaking in his home state of nevada, reid urged the president to avoid a partisan battle by choosing someone like o'connor. %$* 307
i am convinced that we have -- this is an opportunity for the president to bring the country together. %$* 298
we need not a lot of acrimony. %$* 298
i think the model that president reagan used in selecting someone just like her is excellent and something i'm sure the president is looking at. %$* 298
and senator ted kennedy also is speaking out about o'connor's retirement and who may replace her. %$* 307
now, let's return to my interview with the senior senator from massachusetts. %$* 307
senator harry reid has already offered some names, republican names, as possible nominees to the white house. %$* 307
are you willing to actually offer some names to the president? %$* 307
and do you expect that he'll reciprocate that, as well? %$* 307
sen. ted kennedy , massachusetts:  i think there are scores of well-qualified republicans, both judges, members of the bar, academicians that would bring the senate together and would be a consensus candidate. %$* 307
i think it's just especially important now. %$* 307
we know that the country is divided, has gone through a very decisive political campaign. %$* 307
there is a lot of division in the country on other issues. %$* 307
this is the extraordinary opportunity for this president to really bring the country together. %$* 307
i would hope that whoever the president nominates is also going to be reflective of the country. %$* 307
can you give us any names? %$* 307
really, it is not wise to do that. %$* 324
but there's a range of different candidates that would obviously gather that kind of support. %$* 324
senator specter today said that he does not believe there are certain seats that should be reserved either for women or minorities on the supreme court. %$* 307
justice o'connor, of course, stepping down. %$* 307
do you believe that's important? %$* 307
should we be replaced with either a woman or another minority? %$* 307
how important is that? %$* 307
i wouldn't put that kind of a test to the president. %$* 324
i think what the american people are looking for is for the court to be reflective of our society. %$* 324
that's rather broad and all-encompassing, but most people can understand what that means. %$* 324
that has not always been the case. %$* 324
it's getting closer to that at the present time. %$* 324
i think the president ought to have a broad latitude. %$* 324
i think the nature, the race and gender of the person is of some consequences symbolically but what's most important, and most important and essential is their core commitment to constitutional values. %$* 324
and i think that's what people are looking for. %$* 324
when president reagan nominated robert bork to the supreme court, you were one of his harshest critics. %$* 307
and you said -- i'm quoting here -- you said, "president reagan obviously took robert bork's ideology into account into making the nomination, and the senate has every right to take it into account in acting on the nomination." %$* 307
do you expect it's going to be a similar kind of battle for president bush and this nomination? %$* 307
well, i would not step back from a battle if it was called for, but i'd rather have him pick a judge rather than have him pick a fight. %$* 324
for republican response, we are joined now by another member of the senate judiciary committee, john cornyn of texas. %$* 307
thank you very much, mr. %$* 307
senator, for joining us. %$* 307
thank you. %$* 365
now, of course, you have been critical of some of the supreme court's recent decisions. %$* 307
you were one who opposed the court's 5-4 eminent domain ruling. %$* 307
and in many big cases, we know that sandra day o'connor has been the swing vote, the pivotal vote here. %$* 307
what do you believe her resignation means? %$* 307
well, she's had a long distinguished record of service on the supreme court. %$* 365
and i think, you know, today is her day. %$* 365
and she deserves the honor and respect that we can give her for that distinguished service. %$* 365
but i also hope that we can bring honor to the senate by conducting the sort of confirmation process that is reflective of our best and does not overly politicize this choice for the supreme court. %$* 365
and even before o'connor announced her resignation, you had said that the white house is considering putting off an announcement of a replacement until perhaps later in the summer to relay delay the amount of time that, of course, that liberal activists, activists would have time to attack the nomination. %$* 307
and we have seen that in the past that happened. %$* 307
has the white house spoken with you about this possible option here? %$* 307
do they plan on perhaps waiting until late august, even early september? %$* 307
my understanding is that the president is likely to make his nomination after july the 8th when he returns from the g-8. %$* 365
but honestly, i think we're all speculating. %$* 365
and there's only one person who really knows for sure. %$* 365
but now that the president has a vacant seat to fill, the senate's got a job to do once the president makes his choice. %$* 365
and my only hope is that we can conduct a fair process, do our job, ask hard questions, do a thorough investigation, but ultimately, conduct an up- or-down vote on the senate floor as we have for 214 years and not have a repeat of some of the bad behavior that i think has not brought the senate great honor in the last few years by filibustering the president's nominees. %$* 365
i'm going to join in the speculation, if you'll indulge me, for just a little bit, because your name has been mentioned as a possible supreme court nominee. %$* 307
have to ask you this question, of course, because of your own legal and political background. %$* 307
have you been approached by anyone in the administration? %$* 307
well, i'll make it easy. %$* 365
i have not. %$* 365
i love my job in the senate. %$* 365
i'm honored to be here. %$* 365
and i think the president has got a large range of potential choices he can make. %$* 365
and senator, also, of course, the group of 14 who came up with a compromise when it came over, the judicial nominees and using that filibuster, they said that, of course, they would be free to use it under only extraordinary circumstances, that particular clause. %$* 585
of course, the president has to be careful not to pick someone who might be supremely conservative and fall into that category. %$* 585
what is your sense, in terms of just how willing they would be used to -- they would be willing to actually interpret that and use that clause, as someone that they could vote against? %$* 585
or does the president have to be careful not to -- he's walking a fine line here. %$* 585
well, i think the president will pick a highly qualified nominee. %$* 365
that's his job. %$* 365
nobody can do it for him. %$* 365
and the senate is not empowered to make that choice, but rather to do our job and conduct a searching investigation into the background of these nominees to make sure that we perform our constitutional duty. %$* 365
but i think one of the things that we have seen is that extraordinary circumstance cannot mean a disagreement over judicial philosophy. %$* 365
otherwise, janice rogers brown and priscilla owen would not have gotten an up-or-down vote in the united states senate, which they did get, and which i think all of these nominees should likely get, whoever they are. %$* 365
senator john cornyn, thank you very much for your time. %$* 307
of course, you're going to be extraordinarily busy over the next couple of months. %$* 307
thanks again. %$* 307
thanks, suzanne. %$* 365
sandra day o'connor broke the glass ceiling at the u.s. supreme court. %$* 307
up next, o'connor's own reflections on her history-making career. %$* 307
judy woodruff makes a comeback on this program to look back on an interview that she did with o'connor. %$* 307
also ahead, will the next supreme court nominee be "borked"? %$* 307
the confirmation process has gotten ugly in the past. %$* 307
will it get worse? %$* 307
and when we go "inside the blogs," online verdicts about o'connor's exit and the future of the court. %$* 307
retiring supreme court justice sandra day o'connor leaves behind a legacy as an independent thinker whose legal decisions were often hard to predict. %$* 307
o'connor is 75-years-old. %$* 307
she was appointed to the high court back in 1981 by president reagan. %$* 307
she is considered what some might call a moderate conservative. %$* 307
and she is also the first woman ever to serve as a supreme court justice. %$* 307
through the years, o'connor developed a reputation as the swing vote on a court divided between liberals and conservatives. %$* 307
she is also known for her narrowly worded opinions and her sharp questioning of attorneys from the bench. %$* 307
with me now to talk more about sandra day o'connor and how o'connor viewed her role on the court is the long-time anchor of this program, now a cnn special correspondent, judy woodruff. %$* 307
judy, so good to have you here with us. %$* 307
suzanne, thanks very much. %$* 586
it's great to be back. %$* 586
and of course, i mean, this is a very busy day for all of us. %$* 307
did this news come as a surprise to you? %$* 307
should we have been surprised? %$* 307
not so much. %$* 586
and i'll explain why in a minute. %$* 586
but i think many people were surprised, because sandra day o'connor is a supreme court justice but she's also very visible, if you will, in the washington social scene. %$* 586
she and her husband are out and about. %$* 586
she's vibrant. %$* 586
she's active. %$* 586
i think that this decision, people would say are surprised, but it probably has something to do with her husband's ailing health. %$* 586
she did say she wanted to spend more time with her family. %$* 586
and you know, suzanne, this reminded me of the story back after election night in 2000 when it was reported that sandra day o'connor said with a group of friends that, if george bush were elected president, she might go ahead and step down. %$* 586
of course, she didn't at the time. %$* 586
but since then, friends have said that she doesn't seem to have been comfortable with president bush's strongly ideological judicial appointments. %$* 586
and it's even -- she's even let it be known, i think, to other friends that she wouldn't be comfortable with a scalia, thomas replacement on the court. %$* 586
so i think that's the reason this has taken some time. %$* 586
and you actually interviewed her two years ago. %$* 307
it's one of the rare television interviews that she ever gave. %$* 307
what was that like? %$* 307
well, i did. %$* 586
i did talk to her. %$* 586
and she doesn't do many television interviews, but she immediately puts you at ease. %$* 586
i mean, as i said, i know her a little bit from around washington. %$* 586
she had written a book called "the majesty of the law," and among other things she talked, of course, her love of the constitution. %$* 586
but i wanted to talk about what it was like to be a woman, the first woman on the court. %$* 586
she talked about how hard that was for her and how much she loved it when justice ruth bader ginsburg came along about a decade later. %$* 586
here's what she said. %$* 586
when i arrived, there had been a large amount of media attention to the selection of a woman and then to see what that woman did under all circumstances. %$* 580
and too much attention, for any reasonable comfort level. %$* 580
and the minute justice ginsburg came to the court, we were nine justices. %$* 580
it wasn't seven and then the women. %$* 580
we became nine. %$* 580
and it was a great relief to me, and i'm sure it was welcome to justice ginsburg. %$* 580
did the two of you have any sort of special bond because you're the first women? %$* 586
well, certainly. %$* 580
we're both appreciative that we have at least two of us here. %$* 580
should there be more? %$* 586
i welcome it. %$* 580
by the same token -- and this is back to what you and i were just discussing -- does it matter that whether there is or isn't, for example, an hispanic justice on the court? %$* 586
well, we'd welcome that, too. %$* 580
i'm sure, for the very reasons i gave you earlier, in a broad sense, people take a certain level of comfort in looking around and seeing who's in office in ways that affect the public. %$* 580
what do you think of this characterization of you as the most powerful woman in america, or as the "new york times" put it a little more modestly, "america's most powerful jurist"? %$* 586
well, i think you have to take that with a heavy, large grain of salt, because i think every member of this court has a certain degree of authority on behalf of the court, but we have an equal voice. %$* 580
and i'm no more powerful than anyone else on this court. %$* 580
that's for sure. %$* 580
and collectively, we do render opinions that matter to people. %$* 580
but i've never looked upon myself or the role of the court as being all-powerful. %$* 580
at the same time, you are characterized again and again as a crucial swing vote. %$* 586
i think that's something the media has devised as a means of writing about the court. %$* 580
and i don't think that has a lot of validity, either. %$* 580
i've even heard lawyers and law professors use that term, because, very clearly, justice o'connor, you have weighed in on some very close decisions on this court. %$* 586
well, we've had... %$* 580
some very visible -- excuse me. %$* 586
o'connor:  we've had many close decisions through the years i've been here. %$* 586
i think the court was more closely divided in the first ten years, in a way, than it is today. %$* 586
and there have been many, many 5-4 decisions. %$* 586
so perhaps that's just been a factor of the times, as well. %$* 586
suzanne, i went on to ask her in that interview if she had given any thought to retirement. %$* 586
now, this was two years ago. %$* 586
she said, "well, i am getting on in years," she said. %$* 586
but she said, "and i have thought, should i or shouldn't i?" %$* 586
but then, of course, she hadn't made the decision then. %$* 586
two years later, she has. %$* 586
and you know her a little bit personally, as well. %$* 307
i do. %$* 586
i mean, i've seen her. %$* 586
she is an enormously warm, engaging person. %$* 586
she always asks about family, about me as a woman and my career. %$* 586
it's very interesting. %$* 586
she once got into a discussion, without betraying any court confidences, about having children and pornography on the internet, and how do you deal with that as a parent. %$* 586
so somebody who's very interested in family and in people, so somebody who's left a mark. %$* 586
judy woodruff, thanks so much. %$* 307
great seeing you again. %$* 307
and as you can imagine, of course, bloggers are assessing the sandra day o'connor announcement. %$* 307
we check in with our blog reporters next to see how the various interest groups are using blogs to spread their messages. %$* 307
it's been a busy day for bloggers all across the political spectrum. %$* 307
for more, we check in with our cnn political producer abbi tatton and jacki schechner, our blog reporter -- jacki? %$* 307
hi, suzanne. %$* 325
i saw that smile. %$* 325
this is actually opening up the very first supreme court nomination in the age of the blogs and political action online. %$* 325
this is a big, big deal. %$* 325
you can take your pick of the headlines today, but they were all of the "let the games begin, this is going to be brutal" variety. %$* 325
and as libertyjustincase.blogspot.com puts it very succinctly, "i guess we know what folks are going to be blogging about the rest of this summer." %$* 325
bloggers, and interest groups, and members of congress are all recognizing the role the internet is going to play in this upcoming supreme court nomination battle, as they are calling it out there. %$* 384
for months, people have been buying up domain names. %$* 384
first of all, the liberal leadership conference on civil rights has bought up confirmroberts.com and also stoproberts.com. %$* 384
that's in reference to judge john roberts of the d.c. %$* 384
circuit, just in case he is the nominee. %$* 384
also, big conservative hugh hewitt at hughhewitt.com, he's been getting in on this, as well. %$* 384
he registered confirmmcconnell.com. %$* 384
and he told the "legal times" that he was trying to get more sites but they'd already been bought up. %$* 384
so hopefully to direct more people over to his blog. %$* 384
now, members of congress have also been recognizing the role the bloggers are going to play that they can mobilize people so quickly. %$* 384
senator edward kennedy, who was a guest earlier on inside politics, had a conference call with bloggers this afternoon, rounding up a group of mostly progressive bloggers, telling them about the next stage in this. %$* 384
one of them was jeralyn merritt, a defense attorney at talkleft.com. %$* 384
at her site, she goes through the different points that were made by the senator, and just emphasizing some of them, like conservative groups have put up $18 million in anticipation of the nominee, certain to rally the cause on the left. %$* 384
and you talked about the speech online. %$* 325
one of the other great things about the internet is the plethora of information that is available in that very short period of time. %$* 325
we've talked about scotusblog.com. %$* 325
that's run by a d.c. law firm. %$* 325
they cover the supreme court. %$* 325
they are now shifting traffic over to their sister site, sctnomination.com. %$* 325
this is the blog covering the nomination process. %$* 325
they are updating with more throughout the day. %$* 325
another site we wanted to show you was watchingwashington.blogspot.com. %$* 325
they have a whole bunch of information over there, including links to the liberal and conservatives groups who are going to be part of this larger debate as it moves forward. %$* 325
they also have links to books that you could buy online. %$* 325
so if you have some more free time over the weekend, suzanne, you can read up through there. %$* 325
we're going to be back to talk a little bit more about reaction when we come back. %$* 325
all that free time we're all going to have this weekend. %$* 307
ok, thank you very much, abbi and jacki. %$* 307
we're, of course, focused on the new supreme court vacancy. %$* 307
but we did want to mention what happened in california today. %$* 307
antonio villaraigosa was sworn in a few hours ago as the new mayor of los angeles. %$* 307
villaraigosa beat incumbent james hahn in a runoff election back in may. %$* 307
he becomes l.a.'s first hispanic mayor in more than a century. %$* 307
when we return, does a summer showdown lie ahead? %$* 307
as justice o'connor prepares to leave the court, i'll talk with our chief political correspondent candy crowley about the potential battle over o'connor's replacement. %$* 307
justice o'connor's retirement announcement comes at a time when americans have a less-than-positive opinion of the supreme court than they once did. %$* 307
our senior political analyst, bill schneider, has been thinking about the polls and how the fight over o'connor's successor may play out, especially when it comes to one particularly hot issue. %$* 307
justice sandra day o'connor's retirement could set off the mother of all political battles -- over abortion rights. %$* 317
o'connor voted in 1992 to reaffirm a woman's constitutionally protected right to abortion. %$* 317
conservatives want president bush to nominate a justice who will cast what could be the deciding vote against that right. %$* 317
and they want to know that up front, before the senate confirmation vote. %$* 317
their cry is, "no more david souters." %$* 317
souter, nominated by the first president bush in 1990, did not define his position on abortion. %$* 317
conservatives were outraged when he turned out to support abortion rights. %$* 317
many liberals denounced the idea that a nominee should have to pass a litmus test on the abortion issue. %$* 317
i don't set up a litmus test for any particular nominees. %$* 324
i have voted for judges which have been pro-life. %$* 324
the cnn/"usa today"/gallup poll asked the public, do you want a new supreme court justice to be someone who would vote to uphold roe v. wade, the decision that legalized abortion, or someone who would vote to overturn it? %$* 317
by better than two to one, americans prefer a supreme court nominee who would vote to uphold roe v. wade and continue to give constitutional protection to abortion rights. %$* 317
even republicans are divided on the issue. %$* 317
nearly half want a justice who would uphold abortion rights. %$* 317
the issue does seem to be more important to anti-abortion voters. %$* 317
most of them say they care a great deal about the choice of a new justice, whereas those who favor abortion rights are less intensely motivated -- right now. %$* 317
but there's a big campaign brewing, almost as intense as a presidential campaign. %$* 317
and when abortion rights supporters feel their rights are being threatened, they have shown that they can rally, as they did against the nomination of robert bork in 1987. %$* 317
in robert bork's america, there is no room at the inn for blacks and no place in the constitution for women. %$* 324
most voters accept the view of abortion rights set out in the supreme court's 1992 decision -- that abortion is a constitutionally protected right that can be limited and regulated. %$* 317
the co-author of that decision? %$* 317
sandra day o'connor. %$* 317
suzanne. %$* 317
and bill, you noticed something rather unique in her background that we don't normally see in other justices. %$* 307
that's right. %$* 317
sandra day o'connor is, as far as i know, the only current member of the supreme court who ever held elected legislative office. %$* 317
in the early 1970s, she was a member of the arizona state senate, and she rose to become the republican majority leader in the state senate, the first woman in the country to rise to that position. %$* 317
now, that's something today that's unusual. %$* 317
in the old days, politicians, elected officials used to be appointed to the supreme court all the time, and served with great distinction. %$* 317
earl warren, former president taft all were on the supreme court. %$* 317
but that's a tradition we don't see much anymore. %$* 317
and i think we're losing something by not having many elected officials on the supreme court. %$* 317
bill schneider, thank you very much for your insights. %$* 307
our political "strategy session" is just ahead, but first we want to consider today's retirement announcement of supreme court justice sandra day o'connor and the potential for another political showdown on capitol hill. %$* 307
with me now to talk more about this is our senior political correspondent, candy crowley. %$* 307
candy, of course, what is this going to mean for 2006, do you think? %$* 307
and we are reading the tea leaves, but that is the next question. %$* 307
there are a billion trails, whichever way you want to look at it. %$* 164
i mean, this is tough, because first of all, so much depends on who the president nominates. %$* 164
is he going to come up with someone more moderate, more in the sandra day o'connor line, or is he in fact going to come up with someone more conservative, something that would tilt the court, as we say? %$* 164
judges, particularly judicial nominees to the supreme court, are of great interest to the cores of both parties -- the conservatives in the republican party, the liberals in the democratic party -- insofar as the fight galvanizes them for 2006. %$* 164
it could have some effect there, but those are generally people that already go to the polls. %$* 164
you know, if he'd nominate someone that gets through without a lot of fanfare, most people probably won't pay a lot of attention. %$* 164
so it really depends on whether this is a huge fight, and then there will be some ramifications although it's tough to know what they will be now, because after all, 2006 is just a year away. %$* 164
and what makes this particular retirement so important, because there was so much talk about rehnquist, and then sandra day o'connor, it's a totally different dynamic here? %$* 307
rehnquist was a conservative. %$* 164
if you replace a conservative with a conservative, it's still a wash on how the supreme court goes. %$* 164
if you replace a moderate or a swing vote, as sandra day o'connor is always referred to as, and you replace that person with a conservative, then you have begun to tilt the court, because there are so many 5-to-4 decisions that sandra day o'connor was the swing vote in that had to do with affirmative action and had to do with roe v. wade. %$* 164
so if you look at those and put a conservative in there, it does change the tilt of the court. %$* 164
having said that, as everyone knows, not everybody votes on the court exactly as those who nominated them thought they should. %$* 164
and talking with your sources this afternoon, what does the bush administration, what is it looking for in a nominee? %$* 307
what do they need to accomplish when they put forward that name, if that person is actually nominated, they're approved and they get their agenda pushed through? %$* 307
well, i mean, what they're looking for is -- i mean, the main thing, and i know you know this as well as i do, that what george bush wants is someone who generally thinks the way he does, who has the bent the way he does. %$* 164
they use the term strict constructionist. %$* 164
and by that, they mean someone that does not interpret the law, but someone who enforces the law. %$* 164
so that has become somewhat code word for a lot of people. %$* 164
but in fact, there are a couple things, it seems to me, that george bush looks for. %$* 164
one of them is someone who does -- is of that ilk, and also someone he's comfortable, with which is why you keep hearing -- %$* 164
for instance, alberto gonzales. %$* 307
absolutely. %$* 164
absolutely. %$* 164
and that's a name you hear more of all when you say comfortable with. %$* 164
right. %$* 307
okay. %$* 307
well, candy, thank you very much for your insights. %$* 307
appreciate that. %$* 307
of course, a potential battle brewing over the president's supreme court nominee would be the latest in a string of recent bitter nomination fights. %$* 307
we get more from  cnn national correspondent bruce morton. %$* 307
years ago, senators didn't even question the supreme court nominees. %$* 321
now, they not only ask questions, they sometimes refuse to give the nominee the job. %$* 321
the yeas are 42. %$* 298
the nays are 58. %$* 298
the nomination is not confirmed. %$* 298
that was the senate in 1987 rejecting a ronald reagan nominee: federal appeals judge robert bork. %$* 321
bork had originally opposed issues that became part of the 1964 civil rights act, feeling merchants had a right to refuse to serve blacks or anybody else. %$* 321
he subsequently changed his mind and enforced the law as solicitor general. %$* 321
he also opposed the idea of a woman's right to an abortion, and said he'd vote to overturn roe v. wade, the decision establishing that right. %$* 321
the question is never whether you like the statutes. %$* 587
the question is, is it in fact contrary to the principles of the constitution. %$* 587
the bork fight was angry, but it was, one way or another, mostly about issues. %$* 321
the most personal confirmation battle ever was probably clarence thomas's. %$* 321
the first president bush nominated conservative thomas to replace liberal thurgood marshall, who'd been the first black justice. %$* 321
fireworks went off when anita hill, a law professor, accused him of sexual harassment when they'd worked together at the equal employment opportunity commission. %$* 321
he talked about pornographic movies, she claimed, and once about a can of coca-cola. %$* 321
he got up from the table at which we were working, went over to his desk to get the coke, looked at the can and asked, who has put pubic hair on my coke. %$* 81
thomas angrily denounced the hearing. %$* 321
it is a message that unless you kowtow to an old order, this is what will happen to you. %$* 588
you will be lynched, destroyed, caricatured by a committee of the u.s. senate rather than hung from a tree. %$* 588
the senate confirmed him, 52-48, in 1991. %$* 321
there have been others. %$* 321
lyndon johnson tried to promote abe fortas from associate justice to chief justice, but republicans filibustered, reports surfaced of fortas taking lecture fees, giving political advice to the president, and johnson withdraw the nomination, and fortas later resigned. %$* 321
richard nixon once nominated a florida judge named g. harold carswell. %$* 321
he was criticized for having supported white supremacy and because law groups rated him mediocre. %$* 321
one defender, republican roman hruska of nebraska, said, "there are a lot of mediocre judges and people and lawyers. %$* 321
they're entitled to a little representation, aren't they?" %$* 321
the senate, 51-45, voted no. %$* 321
carswell was not confirmed. %$* 321
bruce morton, cnn, washington. %$* 321
sandra day o'connor's resignation changes the political calculus in washington. %$* 307
we'll talk about its effects on the high court as well as the high-stakes battle to name her replacement. %$* 307
that is all coming up in our "strategy session." %$* 307
welcome back to inside politics and our "strategy session" on today's hottest political topics. %$* 307
with us today, cnn contributor jack valenti and cnn political analyst bob novak. %$* 307
of course, thank you very much for joining us. %$* 307
today's topic, justice sandra day o'connor retires from the supreme court. %$* 307
we'll look at what this blockbuster announcement means for the court. %$* 307
and talk about possible replacements. %$* 307
president bush was quick to praise o'connor after receiving her resignation letter. %$* 307
it reads, "in part, it has been a great privilege indeed to have served as a member of the court for 24 terms. %$* 307
i will leave it with enormous respect for the integrity of the court and its role under our constitutional structure." %$* 307
when president ronald reagan appointed her 24 years ago, americans had high expectations of her. %$* 161
and she has surpassed those expectations in the performance of her duties. %$* 161
this great lady, born in el paso, texas, rose above the obstacles of an earlier time and became one of the most admired americans of our time. %$* 161
now, a lot of people were surprised that the o'connor resignation came before rehnquist. %$* 307
bob, you were not. %$* 307
you predicted this on monday in your column. %$* 307
what made you think so? %$* 307
well, i had a tip from a very good source who was very close on this and i checked it out with a couple other people. %$* 493
and it's good enough to go with. %$* 493
it's always nice when you're confirmed on something five days later. %$* 493
justice o'connor, you know, suzanne, 24 years ago, her selection leaked out during the 4th of july weekend. %$* 493
and it was -- it created a fire storm in the conservative community, because she had been a pro- choice senator in arizona. %$* 493
and they said this is a disaster. %$* 493
and president reagan was very disturbed at first, but he -- there was a little investigation at the justice department by a young lawyer named ken starr of her. %$* 493
he said, she's fine. %$* 493
she's going to be good on abortion. %$* 493
well, she wasn't good on abortion. %$* 493
she's been a great disappointment, though not a surprise to conservatives. %$* 493
and she has really been a swing voter who usually swings with the liberals on social issues about abortion, gender, and all other issues that are very important to the people who elected george w. bush. %$* 493
so jack, what do you think is going to be really the implications of all of this, particularly when it comes to the roe v wade decision. %$* 307
well, this is a nerve-bending vacancy because of roe v wade. %$* 327
interestingly enough, about 65 percent of the american people believe that roe v wade is the right decision. %$* 327
and that any justice who comes who wants to overturn it is going to be going against heavy public opinion in favor. %$* 327
so i think this will be an appointment that -- the replacement for sandra day o'connor will be a fire storm. %$* 327
i mean, it will be armageddon time. %$* 327
and rightly so, because i think she was unpredictable in a lot of ways. %$* 327
although bob points out, rightly i think on social issues, she was the fifth vote on 5-4 decisions. %$* 327
and therefore, being a swing vote becomes an extraordinary important vacancy. %$* 327
i can't tell you, suzanne, how important this is to conservatives to find somebody who is not like sandra day o'connor. %$* 493
and particularly when the abortion issue, of course, the polls that do show that most americans believe in the right to choice here. %$* 307
does the president need to push forward a consensus candidate here in order to get the rest of his domestic agenda accomplished? %$* 307
because obviously, he is having a problem with that. %$* 307
no, i don't believe so at all. %$* 493
we have on the court seven of the nine justices were pointed by republican presidents. %$* 493
and yet the conservative cause keeps losing, 5-4 on decisions. %$* 493
so there's tremendous pressure to not to have a consensus candidate, but to shift the court by a conservative. %$* 493
you know, there's a lot of talk about public opinion polls. %$* 493
the court is not supposed to follow public opinion polls, they're supposed to follow the constitution. %$* 493
they're not politicians, they're supposed to be judges. %$* 493
i don't think the constitution -- i can't see the word abortion anywhere in the constitution. %$* 327
what the justices do is try to figure out what the framers had in mind, strict constructionists. %$* 327
but i think when you and the court continually goes against the vast ocean of public opinion, that is not good. %$* 327
and that's why this appointment has to be someone who is going to believe in roe v wade. %$* 327
ok.  we'll continue that on the other side of the break. %$* 307
o'connor was just one of four justices nominated to the supreme court by ronald reagan. %$* 307
now president bush will get the chance to name his first. %$* 307
we'll talk about some possible candidates coming up on "strategy session." %$* 307
i'm john king reporting from new york. %$* 53
coming up at the top of the hour, supreme court justice sandra day o'connor announces her retirement and the fight over replacing her is already underway. %$* 53
16 bodies have been recovered from a u.s. helicopter. %$* 589
but what happened to the elite troops the chopper crew was trying to rescue? %$* 589
brooke shields fires back at tom cruise. %$* 590
all those stories and much more just minutes away on "wolf blitzer reports." %$* 590
now back to inside politics. %$* 590
welcome back to inside politics. %$* 307
just moments ago, the supreme court press office released statement from the other justices about today's retirement of sandra day o'connor. %$* 307
chief justice rehnquist called her, quote, "a long-time friend." %$* 307
and he said he will miss her greatly. %$* 307
justice antonin scalia called her, quote, "a star." %$* 307
justice clarence thomas said he was deeply saddened. %$* 307
and justice stephen breyer called her a treasured colleague and great friend. %$* 307
now back to "strategy session." %$* 307
with us, of course, jack valenti and bob novak. %$* 307
justice o'connor's resignation kicks off a high stakes battle to replace her. %$* 307
president bush fired the first salvo across the bow of the u.s. senate. %$* 307
the nation deserves and i will select a supreme court justice that americans can be produced of. %$* 161
the nation also deserves a dignified process of confirmation in the united states senate characterized by fair treatment, a fair hearing and a fair vote. %$* 161
jack, what kind of person should president bush nominate? %$* 307
i said i think he ought to have somebody who's going to be -- and the temperament and the judicial objectives of sandra day o'connor. %$* 327
if he picks somebody who is a really such a staunch conservative that it will blight that vacancy because chief justice rehnquist will probably retire, i suppose, before the end of his term. %$* 327
and you have these two vacancies. %$* 327
rehnquist has always been on the conservative side. %$* 327
and sandra day o'connor has to be replaced by somebody like her. %$* 327
but bob, does that mean, should it be a woman? %$* 307
should it be a minority that holes that seat? %$* 307
is that important? %$* 307
i think it is important. %$* 493
all the speculation i've heard today, there hasn't been talk about naming a woman. %$* 493
now what it has to be, contrary to what my friend jack valenti says, it has to be a conservative. %$* 493
it cannot be another sandra day o'connor. %$* 493
that would be a tremendous setback. %$* 493
this is -- she has had a very disappointing tenure in the eyes of the conservative movement. %$* 493
all of these statements by the justices, of course, they're brothers and sisters. %$* 493
that's what you expect. %$* 493
but someone i have mentioned, they've talked to is somebody who is not well-known, it's appeals judge edith clement in new orleans. %$* 493
and she's been quickly confirmed for district judge, for appeals judge. %$* 493
she's a conservative. %$* 493
doesn't mean she's that controversial. %$* 493
and i am -- i will make a prediction that it will not be attorney general gonzalez who is very unacceptable to the conservative movement. %$* 493
and there will be a conservative. %$* 493
but i would bet it would be a woman who is not a flash point and is not going to be antagonistic to anybody. %$* 493
i will make two predictions. %$* 327
if justice rehnquist, chief justice retires, i would very much say that gonzalez will be one of the two appointees. %$* 327
and i'll also predict that justice scalia will be named to be chief justice, which would in my judgment would i think would be great. %$* 327
he is a great legal scholar. %$* 327
but i think that this is going to be a flash point as bob said. %$* 327
i think bob's idea of justice o'connor being a disappointment is a flexible definition of that word, disappointment, because i think she's been spectacularly successful. %$* 327
she's been able to bridge that gap between liberal and conservative and be the swing vote on so many of these social issues. %$* 327
in light of the fact it was so bitter over the federal judicial nominees, do you think we're going to see that type of nuclear option this time around? %$* 307
or do you think they're exhausted by that? %$* 307
was a dress rehearsal, it's been resolved, we're going to look at something less contentious. %$* 307
i will bet that the president is going to call the democrats and teddy kennedy's bluff by naming somebody, not necessarily her, like judge clement, who is going to say this is a very strong conservative. %$* 493
are you going to filibuster her? %$* 493
and if they filibuster her, suzanne, they will use the constitutional option. %$* 493
there is no question in my mind. %$* 493
they will not tolerate a filibuster and they're going to get people like senator dewine of ohio and senator graham of south carolina who are in the group of 14 to join that movement. %$* 493
we'll have to leave it. %$* 307
i think that would be a brutal mistake. %$* 327
ok.  we're going to have to leave it at that. %$* 307
we'll see if these predicts actually come true. %$* 307
thank you very much jack valenti, and of course, bob novak for joining us on the :strategy session." %$* 307
bloggers wasted little time reacting to word of a supreme court retirement. %$* 307
up next, we revisit our blog reporters to sample reaction to sandra day o'connor's announcement. %$* 307
and this just in to cnn, federal agents today searched the offices of a defense contractor as well as a boat owned by congressman duke cunningham of california. %$* 307
the government has been investigating mzm incorporated and its ties to congressman cunningham. %$* 307
mitchell wade, the founder of the defense firm bought a home last year owned by cunningham and he later sold it for a loss. %$* 307
a government official confirms to cnn that today's search is part of a, quote, "ongoing investigation being conducted by various federal agencies." %$* 307
now, political bloggers are reacting to the cunningham story and to sandra day o'connor's retirement. %$* 307
time now to rejoin cnn political producer abbi tatton and jacki schechner, our blog reporter -- jacki. %$* 307
hi, suzanne. %$* 325
this is a story that has been big on the blogs for quite some time now. %$* 325
no surprise that josh marshal at talkingpointsmemo.com picked up on it quickly, linking to excerpts of an article with details of the boat and offices being raided. %$* 325
also at thinkprogress.org, they have it, as well. %$* 384
this is a very popular story on the left side of the blogosphere. %$* 384
now too much commentary at this point, because it's just happened. %$* 384
but they did take a moment to stop talking about the supreme court to post on this. %$* 384
but the supreme court nomination and the ensuing battle that no doubt is going to happen this summer is the big story out there. %$* 384
daily kos was quick to post action items for people today. %$* 384
what can you do even though there's no nominee at this point? %$* 384
you can recruit your friends, sign up for web sites, copy these action items into your blog and also e-mail them out. %$* 384
they are also discussing potential nominees. %$* 384
the one that keeps coming up over and over again is attorney general alberto gonzalez. %$* 384
not a popular figure on the left side of the blogosphere. %$* 384
he's actually not popular on the right, as well. %$* 325
we go over to confirmthem.com. %$* 325
stop gonzalez now. %$* 325
saying if you own a conservative blog, your action item is to post on this and get everybody you know to post on this that gonzalez is not conservative enough for those on the right. %$* 325
suzanne, we'll send it back to you. %$* 325
all right. %$* 307
thanks very much, abbi and jackie. %$* 307
that is it for inside politics. %$* 307
i'm suzanne malveaux. %$* 307

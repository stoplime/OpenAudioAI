and then also, i wanted to, i, i know this twenty/eighty has been brought up a lot, this percentage that, that’s mentioned – the kyoto protocol. %$* 9
and for me, i just kind of wonder how long are we going to keep using, uh, that as an excuse to not lead the way for developing countries, once they are developed and they’re looking to us for the next step and the only thing that we have to say is, look back at other developing countries and stand still? %$* 9
but, could i take a first, could i take a crack at peak oil? %$* 101
actually, i would like to go to philip stott. %$* 13
sorry. %$* 13
it’s a very fine question. %$* 103
thank you for the peak oil question. %$* 103
because, of course, we’re obsessed with oil, but of course, there's gas and above all, as peter has emphasized, coal. %$* 103
and it all depends on price again. %$* 103
just remember how the dreaded state, the apartheid state of south africa, actually survived the european, um, uh, embargoes, for example. %$* 103
it was, of course, by turning coal into oil. %$* 103
and there are vast coal reserves. %$* 103
when we, we’re obsessed with the oil, but in fact, you have to take the whole of, of, of the group before you even question that. %$* 103
so look at the whole package, not just oil. %$* 103
in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) %$* 103
yeah, hunter. %$* 13
if china had continued to grow economically at the rate that it was – and this recent collapse has affected china as well – by 2030 it would have wanted more oil than the world now lifts or probably can ever lift. %$* 104
obviously, at that point the future is not possible. %$* 104
the international energy agency says, expect serious constraints on the supply of oil within two years. %$* 104
the germans think a year. %$* 104
matt simmons, the houston oil banker, says we’ve already hit peak oil. %$* 104
and what has held it up, what held up the run-up in prices is the economic collapse. %$* 104
it really doesn’t matter. %$* 104
the investments that you would want to make if you were scared to death about peak oil are exactly the same investments you’d want to make if you simply want to make money, i.e., energy efficiency, and then renewable energy. %$* 104
so i think peak oil falls into the same problem as climate change. %$* 104
yeah, it’s worth doing something about it because we can make money that way. %$* 104
bjorn lomborg. %$* 13
again, we need to get a sense of proportion. %$* 99
a lot of people are trying to sell you, oh, we can move to renewables. %$* 99
we can do a in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) lot of great things. %$* 99
let’s just remember that the international energy agency, as you just mentioned, estimate that right now we use about half of one percent of our energy comes from real renewables like wind and solar and geo-thermal. %$* 99
if we don’t do anything by 2030 it’ll be up to one point seven percent. %$* 99
but if we really strive, if we really do everything that all those people, over here on this side wants us to do we might be able to – the international energy agency estimates – to squeeze it up to two point eight percent. %$* 99
i’m sorry, that’s just not gonna make a big difference in this world. %$* 99
and that’s, of course, the real crucial point. %$* 99
neither are those numbers correct. %$* 104
bjorn. %$* 104
but the point is. %$* 99
we can meet, the u.s. national energy lab showed, by 2025 we could be meeting at least a quarter of u.s. energy through renewables if we simply made the intelligent investments. %$* 104
but there was a report in 1950 that said we could do it now. %$* 99
i mean, how can you keep on making these sorts of comparisons? %$* 99
in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) %$* 99
if you included nuclear in renewables the figures change. %$* 103
hey, i like nuclear. %$* 104
i really do. %$* 104
there’s a lot of – yes, you do. %$* 103
and a lot of environmentalists don’t. %$* 103
remotely sited, ninety-three million miles away will do just fine. %$* 104
yeah. %$* 32
the only way britain will make its is very, very simple, as all the governments have known – and tony blair knew extremely well – is that if we do not have a new generation of nuclear there’s absolutely no way we shall meet anything like a renewable target. %$* 103
this concludes round two of the debate. %$* 13
thank you for all of your questions and thank you to our panel for quite seriously rising to the occasion. %$* 13
in a moment we’re going to do two things. %$* 13
each panelist will have two minutes to make in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) summary remarks. %$* 13
i will tell them if their time is up. %$* 13
when their time is up, if they run over, and right after that we will be polling you to determine the winner of this debate. %$* 13
and i want to remind you once again of the results we received when we polled you coming in off of the street. %$* 13
the motion is: that major reductions in carbon omissions are not worth the money. %$* 13
coming in off the streets, in your response to that, sixteen percent of you were in support of that motion, forty-nine percent of you were against the motion and thirty-five percent of you were undecided. %$* 13
we’ll poll you again right after the closing remarks, which will be quite brief. %$* 13
and we’ll begin summing up against the motion. %$* 13
oliver tickell, journalist and author of the kyoto2 climate initiative. %$* 13
oliver tickell. %$* 13
someone asked the question, how far should we go? %$* 100
and you know, at what point have we made sufficient cuts in greenhouse gas emissions? %$* 100
and there is, in fact, quite a clear answer to that. %$* 100
what we’ve gotta do, philip stott is quite right when he says, we can’t stop climate change. %$* 100
what we’ve gotta do is to stop the runaway greenhouse effect in which positive feedback processes in the climate system lead to an inexorable extreme warming process, turning this planet into a very different place, a hothouse earth – one in which the limiting factor on humans isn’t so much whether we can survive the temperatures. %$* 100
in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) it’s whether the climate system can survive these temperatures. %$* 100
it’s whether ice caps can survive these temperatures. %$* 100
and the bottom line actually came from jim hanson of nasa, of columbia university, just up the road – and that is, three fifty parts per million. %$* 100
if we manage to have long term stabilization at three hundred and fifty parts per million of co2 accompanied by major reductions in other greenhouse gases, we actually have a chance of preventing that runaway greenhouse effect. %$* 100
now, i think it’s worth spending almost any amount of money to stop that from happening. %$* 100
the fantastic news is we don’t have to. %$* 100
actually, the costs are really quite modest in the context of the global economy and they bring benefits, which are greater, considerably greater than what we spend. %$* 100
and it’s spread over a far wider area than simply economic benefits. %$* 100
they bring quality of life benefits, ecological benefits, benefits in food security, benefits in bio-diversity. %$* 100
and so to come back to the point of this – is it worth making these investments in order to bring about major cuts in carbon dioxide, in the emissions? %$* 100
the answer is, yes, it is. %$* 100
and i’m very happy to know that this is actually on the verge of taking place here in the united states under the new president, obama. %$* 100
oliver tickell, thank you very much. %$* 13
making, in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) making his summary remarks for the motion – bjorn lomborg, founder of the copenhagen consensus. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 99
it’s a little depressing to see that i started out telling you that we were gonna hear two arguments. %$* 99
and indeed we have heard them. %$* 99
one is that this is gonna be the end of the world and therefore we need to do whatever oliver says. %$* 99
i’m not really sure that’s such a great argument. %$* 99
i would simply say we know from the u.n.climate panel that global warming will cause problems but it will not by any means be the end of the world. %$* 99
it is one of the many problems we need to tackle and that’s exactly why we’re having this debate-- %$* 99
exactly asking, is this worth the money or should we indeed do other things? %$* 99
and that’s, of course, the other slightly sad thing, that it’s a false choice. %$* 99
we can do everything but we don’t. %$* 99
and so my question to you is really very, very simply, how do you want to be remembered? %$* 99
al gore actually points this out very well. %$* 99
he says, this is our generational mission. %$* 99
he asks you, how do you want to be remembered by your kids and your grandkids? %$* 99
i find it stunning that he would actually make that argument because the real question is, do you want to be remembered for having spent hundreds of billions or even trillions of dollars to do virtually no good a hundred years from now? %$* 99
in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) or do you want to be remembered for actually having solved all the major problems that half of this world’s population suffers-- %$* 99
these medieval, terrible tragedies that we are watching right now? %$* 99
this is really about how you want to be remembered. %$* 99
and i hope you want to be remembered by doing a lot of good rather than just a little bit. %$* 99
that’s what tonight’s decision is about. %$* 99
that’s the tradeoff. %$* 99
thank you. %$* 99
thank you, bjorn lomborg. %$* 13
arguing, summing – and adam, can you see the clock? %$* 13
i just want to make sure that it’s obvious to you. %$* 13
summing up against the motion, adam werbach, global ceo of saatchi and saatchi s. %$* 13
john muir, the founder of the sierra club – he founded it in 1892 – said that when you pick anything up by itself you find it hitched to everything else in the universe. %$* 102
and that hitchedness is what i refuse to let go. %$* 102
mr. %$* 102
lomborg, others say it’s a choice, that we can either create green jobs, that we can launch a new apollo project, that we can’t do that and deal with poverty, global poverty, at the same time. %$* 102
in fact, we have to. %$* 102
and when you ask the question, how do you want to be remembered? %$* 102
– i don’t want to be remembered as a person who, to my three kids, as the one who saw a crisis facing us and who ignored it. %$* 102
we can do something about this. %$* 102
mr. %$* 102
stott says that, glibly, that people can in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) live in the sahara, they can live to, in greenland. %$* 102
it makes it sound like you just need to put shorts on and that will deal with climate change. %$* 102
it is more serious than that. %$* 102
mr. %$* 102
huber describes himself as a technical utopian, but doesn’t want a system to regulate that technology in the end and to guarantee the marketplace for that. %$* 102
and that sounds to me quite familiar to marketing subprime loans but not having a strong enforcement mechanism, not having an sec that could actually maintain the investment structures here in the united states. %$* 102
more reductions in carbon emissions are worth the money. %$* 102
and many of the anecdotes we shared tonight are examples of how they are worth the money. %$* 102
and the reason we used anecdotes is because we actually have examples of how it’s actually happening. %$* 102
now, you can deny that. %$* 102
you can say those act. %$* 102
those aren’t real, and those don’t add up. %$* 102
or you can actually look at them. %$* 102
and there is a reason why the world’s largest company went to china and told its thousand largest suppliers that it will pay more money if it has to build better products. %$* 102
they want quality socks, not socks that fall down. %$* 102
and those quality socks probably have less energy in them as well. %$* 102
major reductions in carbon are worth the money. %$* 102
we’re not going to do unintelligent things. %$* 102
we’re going to spend it right. %$* 102
in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) %$* 102
thank you, adam werbach. %$* 13
reminding you that the motion is: major reductions in carbon emissions are not worth the money, and making his final summary for the motion – peter huber, author of the bottomless well and a columnist for forbes. %$* 13
well, and now i am done, i am going to get personal and nasty. %$* 101
and i’m going to talk to you over there, and you. %$* 101
yeah, you know who you are – and also you. %$* 101
and like a medieval priest, you know, there are carbon brokers out there today who will sell you an indulgence that will forgive all your carbon sins. %$* 101
it will run you about five hundred dollars for five tons of carbon, which is about what the typical american needs – or about two thousand dollars per typical household. %$* 101
your broker will spend the money on something good – most likely cleaning up hog farms in brazil. %$* 101
but if you really want to make a difference, you must send a check large enough to forgive four brazilian households, too, because they can’t afford that. %$* 101
so to cover all five households – the rich one and the four poor – make it four thousand dollars. %$* 101
and you probably forgot to send a check last year and who knows? %$* 101
, some of you might even forget it for the next eight years. %$* 101
let’s cover all the sins, you know, one backed, this year’s and in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) eight in advance. %$* 101
you’ll feel so much better if you’ve already paid for these future sins. %$* 101
let’s make it ten years, forty thousand dollars. %$* 101
now, if you honestly believe that substantial reductions in carbon emissions are worth the money, you will, sadly, vote against the proposition. %$* 101
but then you must, you absolutely must, scurry right back home and send your check in because if you don’t you will have burdened your already sooty soul with an extra five tons of self- righteous hypocrisy. %$* 101
and you can’t possibly, you can’t possibly afford what it will take to forgive that. %$* 101
your other-- %$* 101
your other option, your other option is to keep your money in the pocket and vote for the proposition. %$* 101
however desperately you may wish it were false, vote for because it is, in fact, a true statement of engineering and economic and geo-political fact. %$* 101
and vote “for” because acknowledging reality is the essential first step in trying to change anything for the better. %$* 101
thank you, peter huber. %$* 13
and with her two minutes to sum up, against the motion, hunter lovins, president and founder of natural capitalism solutions. %$* 13
boys, you’ve done a pretty good job of arguing what is essentially an untenable proposition. %$* 104
why is it in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) untenable? %$* 104
because the numbers are in. %$* 104
goldman sachs, july two years ago, showed that the companies that are leading the way in cutting their emissions, in implementing energy efficiency have twenty-five percent higher stock value than their competitors. %$* 104
the economist intelligence unit, last february – the companies that are leading in this have the highest, fastest growing stock value and, conversely, the worst performing companies in the economy are most likely to have nobody in charge of these issues. %$* 104
deutsche asset management, dr. %$* 104
bruce kahn: this is a historic opportunity for the administration to take a global leadership position in energy while addressing the current economic and financial crisis. %$* 104
he calls for a green national infrastructure bank investing in energy efficiency and renewables. %$* 104
he said, spend on the green sweet spot-- %$* 104
efficiency in buildings, the new electric grid, renewables and public tranist. %$* 104
he said, credible scientific debate is over. %$* 104
as more dynamic models of climate change are developed, we expect to see estimates of the danger of global warming increasing. %$* 104
this is the business community, folks. %$* 104
this is simply a better way of doing business. %$* 104
now, you hold in your hands the future. %$* 104
you can choose to vote for the finest thinking of the twentieth century or you can vote for the future. %$* 104
you can vote to unleash this new energy in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) prosperity. %$* 104
it matters what you vote now. %$* 104
we have argued – and i think we’ve proven-- %$* 104
that cutting carbon is worth the money. %$* 104
we have not tried to argue that these investments will solve everything. %$* 104
we have also argued – i have – that these are the investments that will deliver genuine development to the rest of the world. %$* 104
so if you care about bjorn’s position you will invest in these low carbon technologies. %$* 104
thank you, hunter lovins. %$* 13
and finally, summing up for the motion, philip stott, emeritus professor and bio- geographer from the university of london. %$* 13
adam quoted a very great american. %$* 103
i’d like also to relate to a northeastern great american – in fact, the very founder of the american ecological movement – george perkins marsh of vermont, who wrote men and nature in 1864, one of the greatest books ever written. %$* 103
and professor david lowenthal, also a great american author of the day, wrote something about him, which is extremely important for us to hear in the case of this debate. %$* 103
environmental reformers who find nature’s inarticulate indifference unbearable impute their own aims to nature and then purport to speak on nature’s behalf. %$* 103
a rarified natural world is then worshiped as virtuous. %$* 103
and marsh himself said, the equation of animal and vegetable life is too complicated a in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) problem for human intelligence to solve. %$* 103
i think there was a mighty humility in marsh’s view of nature, which actually we’ve forgotten today, which is vital. %$* 103
‘cause what i am interested in is outcomes. %$* 103
will it work? %$* 103
remember the motion is major cuts. %$* 103
i’m really serious about this. %$* 103
we agree on the influence that climate change will have impacts on people. %$* 103
of course it will. %$* 103
but what is really in the end going to work? %$* 103
it’s got to work. %$* 103
that’s why peter’s realism is absolutely essential to all this. %$* 103
and back to johnson to end. %$* 103
he said, why, sir, most schemes of political improvement are very laughable things, he said – which i think is an important way of always looking at it. %$* 103
but finally, the limits of all that we’re doing here – also johnson. %$* 103
how small of all that human hearts endure that part which laws or kings or senates or congresses – i’ve added those-- %$* 103
can cause or cure. %$* 103
in the end we want to solve this because we think it’s us. %$* 103
i’m afraid it’s nature, greater than us, and we can’t in the end manage it as we wish we would. %$* 103
thank you. %$* 103
thank you, philip stott. %$* 13
and as their job is now done, i’d like to show some appreciation for our, our entire panel. %$* 13
and it’s clear, given, i would say, the unusual level of passion that we heard in this debate tonight, that these panelists very, very seriously are vying for your votes and want to win. %$* 13
and now comes the moment when you decide. %$* 13
in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) i want to remind you that before the debate sixteen percent were for the motion that: major reductions in carbon emissions are not worth the money. %$* 13
forty-nine were against, thirty-five percent were undecided. %$* 13
please pick up your key pads. %$* 13
it’s time to vote again. %$* 13
if you support the motion, press number one. %$* 13
if you are against the motion, press number two. %$* 13
if you remain or became undecided, press number three. %$* 13
does anybody need more time? %$* 13
everybody’s good? %$* 13
cause we’re gonna lock out the system. %$* 13
and we’ll have the results up to me in just a moment. %$* 13
in the meantime, i want to tell you while the vote is being tallied that our next debate will be back at the caspary auditorium at the rockefeller university. %$* 13
that’s on the east side, if you don’t know. %$* 13
the motion to be debated on tuesday, february 3rd, is this: the art market is less ethical than the stock market. %$* 13
panelists for the motion are richard feigin, michael hugh williams and adam lindemann. %$* 13
against the motion we have amy cappellazzo, chuck close and jerry saltz. %$* 13
i hope that i’ll see many of you in a few weeks at the caspary auditorium. %$* 13
and how close are we to having the paper come up? %$* 13
do you know, joe? %$* 13
bob? %$* 13
okay, it’s on its way. %$* 13
this can be a very brief talk amongst yourselves moment. %$* 13
in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) and remember, the way that we measure victory in this is not where the room sits at the end but the dynamic of how the room moved. %$* 13
and so those undecided votes are critically important. %$* 13
here we go. %$* 13
well, it’s very interesting. %$* 13
here are the final results from your poll on our motion that: major reductions in carbon emissions are not worth the money. %$* 13
before the debate sixteen percent of you were for the motion, forty-nine percent against and thirty-five percent were undecided. %$* 13
after the debate, forty-two percent of you are for the motion, forty-eight percent are against and ten percent are undecided. %$* 13
the side for the motion has moved more people, changed more minds. %$* 13
congratulations to them. %$* 13
and thank you, debaters. %$* 13
and to the rosenkranz foundation and to you for joining us, wherever you are watching in the world. %$* 13

these are not amateurs. %$* 91
these are as good as polls that come out in this country. %$* 91
there may be some-- %$* 91
there's always several percentage points. %$* 91
but in general, you know that the trend is pro american, pro-nato, anti-taliban. %$* 91
matthew hoh. %$* 13
matthew, let me put the question to you. %$* 13
i just want to remind people of your background in afghanistan. %$* 13
you went out there as a foreign service officer. %$* 13
you had served in iraq. %$* 13
you believed in missions. %$* 13
this one, you walked away from. %$* 13
what was it that-- %$* 13
what was the ultimate turning point for you that you would do something so dramatic that you saw such failure written there that you would turn away from it? %$* 13
the main thing is our troops aren't fighting al-qaeda. %$* 88
they're fighting taliban. %$* 88
they're fighting people who are upset that we're occupying their villages and valleys. %$* 88
the u.s. intelligence community will cite-- %$* 88
you can look at the boston globe from september 2009, that nine out of ten members of the taliban are members of the taliban because of foreign occupation and because of an ongoing civil war. %$* 88
i actually support peter and max's polls. %$* 88
60 percent or 68 percent of afghans are for our presence. %$* 88
32 percent are violently opposed to the point they'll take up rifles. %$* 88
this-- %$* 88
afghanistan is not a homogenous society. %$* 88
it's a regionalized, localized society with many, many different ethnic schisms, regional schisms. %$* 88
there are hatfield and mccoy type situations that our troops are finding themselves in the middle every day. %$* 88
and remember, this war goes back to the '70s. %$* 88
the reason the soviet union intervened in afghanistan was because the country was already at war. %$* 88
so we-- %$* 88
in 2001, when we intervened, the country was at civil war. %$* 88
we took one side out of power and put the other side in power, but we didn't address those underlying root causes of the conflict. %$* 88
now, getting back to the polling data, again, i support that. %$* 88
you probably have about a 60/40 split in the country. %$* 88
i'll also say that some of the things-- %$* 88
you've got to look at the polling data real well because, yes, 7 percent of the population supports the taliban. %$* 88
however, in the asia foundation poll that was just cited, 80 percent of the population supported talking to the taliban and negotiating with them. %$* 88
here is the deal, if you are given a choice, if you are a rural pashtun villager, and you are given a choice between the taliban who are ethnically and culturally similar to you or the karzai government which is made of up non-rural pashtuns, outsiders who are corrupt and who are backed up by an invading and occupying army, which are you going to choose? %$* 88
all right, let's go-- %$* 13
it's a bad choice. %$* 88
let's go to max boot, and %$* 13
can i just-- %$* 89
can i take issue with a point that matt has made several times now, which is to suggest that the taliban are fighting essentially because we're there. %$* 89
that really flies in the face of history. %$* 89
and the fact is the taliban movement began in the mid 1990s, when there was not a single american soldier in all of afghanistan. %$* 89
they were a response to the chaos to the conditions that prevailed in afghanistan when we had no presence at all there. %$* 89
and they managed to take over the country after a brutal and horrifying civil war and to impose one of the most totalitarian and anti-diluvian roles the world has ever seen in afghanistan. %$* 89
so the notion that somehow the taliban would go away or would stop fighting or would suddenly be transformed into mother teresa if we weren't there is really ahistorical because if we weren't there, they would take over as they did last time in the 1990s. %$* 89
nir rosen, is that what you're saying? %$* 13
well, they'll probably take over much of the country. %$* 90
that's true. %$* 90
we rest our case. %$* 89
this is not the taliban of pre-2001.this is an insurgent movement which is very clear about its goals. %$* 90
they are local people, local farmers who are fighting for very local reasons. %$* 90
maybe it's anti-occupation, maybe it's for islam or for their village or for revenge or because americans are backing one tribe against another tribe. %$* 90
but they are locals fighting for afghanistan. %$* 90
they've always been very clear about that. %$* 90
i love the fact that this is not the taliban of 2001.this is a much worse taliban. %$* 91
this is a taliban that is more ideologically with al-qaeda. %$* 91
the reason that we're facing the big insurgency that we are is that they've adopted wholesale al-qaeda's tactics from the iraqi theater. %$* 91
suicide attacks went up five times between 2005 and 2006, ied attacks. %$* 91
these groups are much more closely aligned. %$* 91
there was a public stoning by the taliban just a few weeks ago. %$* 91
and so the idea that somehow the moderate taliban are going to kind of take-- %$* 91
come into afghanistan is nonsensical. %$* 91
the whole notion of a moderate taliban is sort of an oxymoron. %$* 91
is that the taliban who let their girls go to school once a month or once a week? %$* 91
these are unreformed, and they got worse over time. %$* 91
i resent the idea that the taliban or the opponents of the taliban in afghanistan are wearing white hats, is not true. %$* 88
we're not suggesting that. %$* 91
neither side are paradigms of women's rights or anything in this conflict. %$* 88
nir rosen and matthew hoh. %$* 13
you're arguing that afghanistan is a lost cause. %$* 13
if afghanistan is lost, if the taliban takes over significant parts of afghanistan or simply the chaos continues in afghanistan is that a threat to american national security? %$* 13
the taliban, with their pickup trucks and ak-47s are no threat to the us.al-qaeda is not in afghanistan. %$* 90
they were defeated. %$* 90
they're in pakistan. %$* 90
they're in yemen. %$* 90
they're in internet cafes and slums around the world. %$* 90
the taliban leadership is composed of afghans. %$* 90
al-qaeda which is based now in pakistan, to the extent that it exists as a real organization is led by arabs and pakistanis. %$* 90
in all the taliban statements, the afghan taliban, not the pakistani taliban, two very different organizations, the afghan taliban speaks very much about their goals in afghanistan. %$* 90
peter conflated the two. %$* 90
it's true-- %$* 90
so we can leave afghanistan, it would not cause-- %$* 13
it would be fine as far as our national security goes. %$* 13
as far as ours, absolutely. %$* 90
we’re not advocating us leaving. %$* 88
i know you're not advocating, i just want to see-- %$* 13
max boot. %$* 13
can i cite a differing opinion here from an article that i consider fairly authoritative on this matter. %$* 89
it says the taliban, once an isolated and impoverished group of religious students who knew little about the rest of the world and cared only about liberating their country from oppressive warlords are now among the best armed and most experienced insurgents in the world linked to a global movement of jihadists that stretches from pakistan and iraq to chechnya and the philippines. %$* 89
now, the author of that article, which ran in “rolling stone,” in 2008, called “how we lost the war we won,” was a fellow named nir rosen. %$* 89
i don't know if you might be related to the gentleman sitting on the other side of the stage here. %$* 89
there is a marriage of convenience, of course there's some cooperation, although we don't see it very much. %$* 90
when you visit villages, as most journalists who have met taliban will say, they are local fighters. %$* 90
they raise money locally. %$* 90
they're not fighting more money, by the way. %$* 90
they're fighting for very local reasons. %$* 90
and you don't really see many arabs among them. %$* 90
when you speak to them, as i have, and other journalists have, they will often criticize the arabs and non-pashtuns among them, and they also condemn suicide bombing as well. %$* 90
but sure, they do use suicide bombers. %$* 90
it's not an al-qaeda tactic. %$* 90
this is an insurgency tactic. %$* 90
it's not so much a question of ideology. %$* 90
matthew, i want to acknowledge that i know that you're not saying-- %$* 13
your position is not that we should cut and run. %$* 13
but a question to the other side now, if we were to leave afghanistan-- %$* 13
because i want to understand what the stakes are in the situation there, being allowed to continue without an american presence were there in order to mitigate those circumstances. %$* 13
if we left, peter bergen and max boot, would that be harmful to american interests? %$* 13
of course, it would be. %$* 91
it would be a moral catastrophe to allow the taliban to take over and impose a regime on afghans. %$* 91
we overthrew their government. %$* 91
we have a moral responsibility to more or less-- %$* 91
so what's the security threat? %$* 13
more or less get it right. %$* 91
well, we already know, when the taliban was in charge of afghanistan, al-qaeda had free rein in the country. %$* 91
the taliban, by the way, have had ten years to say 9/11 was a bad idea, al-qaeda is a bad idea. %$* 91
osama bin laden really was kind of a problem for us. %$* 91
they've never said that. %$* 91
they never-- %$* 91
one of the central-- %$* 91
if there are negotiations with the taliban, you know, one of the things they've got to do is reject al-qaeda. %$* 91
they've never done that. %$* 91
and in fact as we've seen in times square that these groups are very closely aligned. %$* 91
pakistani taliban, though. %$* 90
it's dishonest to compare the afghan taliban with the pakistani taliban. %$* 90
it's the taliban. %$* 91
they're all based in pakistan right now because we thankfully got a lot of them out of afghanistan. %$* 91
and if we got out of afghanistan, they would all come back to afghanistan. %$* 91
they're only in pakistan because we are forcing them out. %$* 91
and what we're trying to prevent is a safe haven in afghanistan coming back for al-qaeda and the taliban who just moved across the border. %$* 91
we can't invade pakistan. %$* 91
let's hear matthew hoh's response. %$* 13
you know, two things, one, i don't think al-qaeda needs a safe haven and wants a safe haven. %$* 88
i'd like them to go back into safe haven. %$* 88
i'd love for them to open farms back in kandahar because then we could bomb them. %$* 88
they do not operate in any manner that we're going to-- %$* 88
they don't operate in a manner that we can attack with conventional forces. %$* 88
again, look at the history of attacks in the last ten years. %$* 88
i urge you to go to the heritage foundation website, the heritage foundation, not a limp-wristed, left-leaning organization by any means. %$* 88
and you'll see that they documented the 30 attacks against the united states by transnational terror groups, primarily by al-qaeda, for the last ten years. %$* 88
and you'll see it's all done by individuals in small cells who don't require large safe havens. %$* 88
since 2001 al-qaeda has evolved into an organization that is decentralized, it's near virtual, and it does not exist in a manner that we can attack. %$* 88
and actually the rand corporation did a study two years ago. %$* 88
and it found that 84 percent of all terrorist groups since the '60s have met their end by either police action, by intelligence action or by political action. %$* 88
so the smart way to go about them is to attack al-qaeda as they actually exist and not as we want them to be or not how they were 10 years ago. %$* 88
they're an organization like any other organization. %$* 88
they evolve. %$* 88
organizations tend not to devolve. %$* 88
it does not make any sense why al-qaeda would want to go to a place or go back into a form where they could be readily attacked by our aircraft, our cruise missiles, our commandos. %$* 88
and like i said, if they did, that's great, because then we could go after them that way. %$* 88
all right. %$* 13
i want to take a break. %$* 13
and when we come back, i want to talk about who our allies are. %$* 13
so as soon as i restart this, i'm going to after a minute or so i would like to go to you in the audience and just gauge from you your take on what you're hearing so far. %$* 13
i'm not asking you for questions. %$* 13
i'm asking you to do something different to fill in the blank on this sentence, "the argument that i am hearing tonight that i think is very weak is-- %$* 13
" and one or two sentences, or, "the argument that i'm hearing tonight that's surprising me with how compelling it is, is-- %$* 13
" and fill in the blank. %$* 13
so in a minute or two i'll come to you, and just raise your hands. %$* 13
we'll have microphones come to you and we'll pick, i think, four people and do it one after the other. %$* 13
so let's come back to the debate. %$* 13
this is a debate from intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
our motion is "afghanistan is a lost cause." and something that has come up in the discussion is the fact that our allies, the government of afghanistan, is not by any definition savory. %$* 13
and i want to go to max boot, because i believe you had in your visit there some contact with them, how much of a problem is that, that the guys that we're backing are so incredibly disliked, which is something that you concede? %$* 13
well, john, the fact is we don't have perfect allies in afghanistan, but that's true in any counterinsurgency fight because think about it, the reason why you have an insurgency in the first place is because the government isn't doing a very good job. %$* 89
and if the government were doing a wonderful job, you would not have an insurgency. %$* 89
despite that, however, most insurgencies fail. %$* 89
the research i've done for this book on the history of guerilla warfare suggests that more than 65 percent of all counterinsurgency efforts have been successful over the last 200 years whereas insurgents have achieved their objectives only about 20 percent of the time. %$* 89
that means in more than 65 percent of cases, it has been possible to increase government capacity to not only militarily defeat the insurgency, but also to take away some of the reasons why they're able to recruit in the first place. %$* 89
and that is something that we are working very hard to do in the case of afghanistan. %$* 89
and there is no question that the afghan government has many imperfections, that it has corruption, it is ineffective, it has a lot of other problems, but, again, on the other side, you are not exactly facing-- %$* 89
you're not exactly facing the league of women voters. %$* 89
you are facing an intensely unpopular group which has far more problems, and which is far more brutal, far more implicated in the drug trade, the people of afghanistan have experienced the rule of both the taliban and the current government. %$* 89
they know the current government has problems. %$* 89
but, again, to refer to those polls which marry up with everything i've learned in my trips to afghanistan, over 90 percent of afghans prefer the current government to the taliban, and that's the underlying reality which will make it possible for us to prevail. %$* 89
your opponent, nir's, point that you're not getting around afghanistan the way he is, that you're not seeing the uglier side of it the way that he has, is painting for you a rosier picture, and it's not quite an ad hominem argument, there's actually an issue of data collection there. %$* 13
and i just want you to respond to it because it was a little bit brushed off before. %$* 13
well, there's no question that nir has embedded with the taliban and i haven’t, so hats off to him. %$* 89
but i’m not sure that necessarily embedding with the taliban gives you a rounded view of what the people of afghanistan think either. %$* 89
and, in fact, the reality is most of the afghans are not part of the taliban. %$* 89
most of them abhor the taliban. %$* 89
and, again, you don’t have to take my word for it, you don’t have to take the word of the pollsters for it, all you have to do is look at the number of afghans who have-- %$* 89
as i mentioned before, who have actually taken up arms against the government. %$* 89
it’s a miniscule portion of the number that took up arms against the soviets in the 1980s who were genuinely detested by the entire population. %$* 89
and to the side that’s arguing that afghanistan is a lost cause, something that your opponents said that i found quite interesting is that you have a very high bar to prove. %$* 13
you are arguing that afghanistan is a lost cause, but when, now or in the future? %$* 13
and if it’s in the future, is-- %$* 13
what if we pour in more troops, what if we increase our effort, what if we simply allow more time to go by, in making things try to work? %$* 13
what’s to say that ultimately with time this could not work out? %$* 13
more is the problem, the more troops we put in there, the more money we’ve put in, we’ve actually created a conflict because of our money. %$* 90
iraq's people are fighting over control of the oil. %$* 90
in afghanistan the only resource is american money. %$* 90
you have warlords that we’re backing competing for american money, you have the taliban who are making money from our presence there, you have afghan police who are selling the bullets we are giving them to the taliban, you have contractors where the americans are paying who are paying bribes to the taliban. %$* 90
it’s all about american money, the more we put in there, the more of our presence, the more supplies it requires, the more warlords we’re paying to protect our convoys. %$* 90
in iraq we were using american mercenary companies. %$* 90
in afghanistan we're using afghan warlords. %$* 90
all right. %$* 13
the problem-- %$* 90
peter, i want you to respond to his-- %$* 13
the main thrust, the more we do, the worse it gets. %$* 13
i think quite the reverse, the less we did, the worse it got. %$* 91
if you look-- %$* 91
go back to 2003, there were 6,000 american soldiers in afghanistan. %$* 91
that’s the size of the police department of houston in a country the size of texas with a population 10 times larger. %$* 91
it was precisely because of the bush administration’s ideological opposition to nation building that we did everything on the cheap and we got what we paid for. %$* 91
into the vacuum of governance and authority stepped the taliban and al qaeda and actually this raises a very good point which is it would be much more convincing to say that look, we should just sort of wash our hands of afghanistan if we hadn’t already done it twice. %$* 91
in 1989 we closed our embassy there after arming the mujahideen and defeating the soviets. %$* 91
the clinton administration then zeroed out aid to one of the poorest countries in the world and into that vacuum stepped the taliban and al qaeda. %$* 91
then in 2001, the bush administration did almost exactly the same thing. %$* 91
so it’s not because we’ve done too much. %$* 91
it’s because we’ve done too little. %$* 91
we’re finally beginning to-- %$* 91
we’re in year one of a serious effort. %$* 91
up to this point, we’ve really done not enough and if you go back to some of our other peace keeping operations, in bosnia we spent 20 times per capita what we’re spending in afghanistan in the first years of occupation; in kosovo, much, much larger. %$* 91
according to the rand corporation, this was the least resourced nation building effort the united states has engaged in since world war ii. %$* 91
all right. %$* 13
let’s hear what your opponent has to say to that. %$* 13
matthew hoh? %$* 13
we did. %$* 88
when we got there in 2001 we were welcomed. %$* 88
people didn’t like the taliban. %$* 88
they didn’t receive their support. %$* 88
they fled to pakistan. %$* 88
we stayed and supported a clique that was the government. %$* 88
the government was exclusionary. %$* 88
and so what you had happen over time, that period from 2002 to 2005 was the american troops never left. %$* 88
we spent a lot of money there that went to enrich a few people and we supported and propped up a corrupt and illegitimate government that was exclusionary. %$* 88
when i say exclusionary, one thing i have to say again, going back to afghanistan, it is a very ethnically regional and localized country. %$* 88
this is as if-- %$* 88
now we’re talking about the government-- %$* 88
i was embedded with the afghan government. %$* 88
i ate a couple of meals with them a day. %$* 88
i had the parasite to prove it. %$* 88
it’s a wonderful weight loss thing, guys. %$* 88
but no, in a sense it would be like after 2005 our federal government put me, a guy from jersey, in charge of a parish in louisiana and sent the new york national guard to keep me in power. %$* 88
that’s the dynamic that you see there. %$* 88
and this idea about-- %$* 88
just to get back-- %$* 88
another thing about the government, the idea that we’re on the side of good and the soviet union was on the side of bad, again, the afghans don’t see it that way. %$* 88
it’s such a confused conflict there. %$* 88
but i can tell you that the afghan army brigade commander i worked with, the afghan police commander i worked with, and the afghan intelligence chief i worked with were all moscow trained. %$* 88
they had all fought on the side of the soviets. %$* 88
the afghan army was well over 100,000 people at times. %$* 88
kabul was so safe for the soviets that soviet administrators used to live in kabul with their families. %$* 88
the soviets had 20,000 civilian advisors there. %$* 88
so the idea that what we’re doing-- %$* 88
i agree with parts of what max said about the difference between us and the soviets but there are also similarities that really can’t be ignored. %$* 88
all right. %$* 13
i’d like to hear from you in the audience to gauge how you think this debate is going and see what you think is persuasive and what is not. %$* 13
what i’d like is for you to do is answer this question. %$* 13
what i’m hearing that makes very good sense to me is-- %$* 13
or what i’m hearing that is just not holding water is-- %$* 13
and i’m not asking you for questions and i’m not asking you for information. %$* 13
i really want your judgment on the arguments that you’re hearing. %$* 13
so any hands go up. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
the woman in the center. %$* 13
we’ll get a microphone over to you. %$* 13
anybody on the-- %$* 13
yes, sir, i’m pointing right at you and you can stand up as well. %$* 13
sir, yeah, yeah and the mic will come to you. %$* 13
anybody else on the-- %$* 13
down front, gentlemen in the brown blazer and the front row in the green sweater. %$* 13
and again, i’ll just ask you to make the statement and you, members of the audience, if you like the critique or observation that we’re hearing, feel free to applaud. %$* 13
there’s one more down here. %$* 13
do we have a fourth microphone? %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
it’s on its way. %$* 13
and we’ll just pass it to the far end of this aisle. %$* 13
sir, could you pass that one down and we’ll get you another one? %$* 13
pass that one to the end of the aisle and there’s another one on your other side. %$* 13
here we go. %$* 13
okay and so you can go first. %$* 13
so i just want to know, what do you think of the debate you’re hearing so far? %$* 13
i found the argument about the poll results to be very, very weak indeed. %$* 18
if these people are not willing to fight to preserve themselves from the taliban, i really wonder whether it matters very much if they say they’re opposed to it when you ask them that. %$* 18
thank you very much. %$* 13
ma'am, you can stand up, and let me just make sure the camera's found you. %$* 13
yes. %$* 13
so the argument i'm hearing tonight is that afghani people don't think afghanistan is a lost cause. %$* 19
i'm from iran, and i go back there for home. %$* 19
and there are quite a few afghanis who work in iran, low-paying jobs, most of them are illegal. %$* 19
and i see-- %$* 19
and i saw them after the government was toppled, that they went back to afghanistan. %$* 19
and a lot of them are back in iran. %$* 19
the country that you just dismissed as being way worse than afghanistan. %$* 19
if afghanis don't think this is a lost cause, why are they coming back to iran to work a low-paying job? %$* 19
thank you. %$* 13
i'm not hearing enough from either side about the role of pakistan and the pakistani government in all of this. %$* 18
because it seems to me it's more than just the difference between the pakistani taliban and the afghani taliban. %$* 18
it's also the fact that there's evidence that elements within the pakistani government are directly funding and/or assisting the insurgency in afghanistan. %$* 18
if that is the case, how can we possibly succeed? %$* 18
all right. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
and one more down front. %$* 13
if you may rise. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
i think that we should have our special forces going around the world defeating al-qaeda. %$* 19
but i think we should pull our army out of afghanistan. %$* 19
there's no way we're going to defeat them with their special groups of fighter warlords that all have different interests. %$* 19
so it's a lost cause to stay there. %$* 19
okay. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
i want to take the question-- %$* 13
turn into a question the comment about pakistan because you have made the case that talking about there being a pakistani taliban. %$* 13
but we haven't really talked a great deal about pakistan as an agent in afghanistan. %$* 13
and this gentleman's comment is that he feels the role of pakistan as a negative influence in what's going on there makes more or less-- %$* 13
is turning this into a lost cause. %$* 13
it's a little bit of an affront to your point of view. %$* 13
so i'd like you to take, that peter bergen. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 91
pakistan has very belatedly begun to realize that the jihadi frankenstein that they helped create, the taliban, has become a huge problem for them. %$* 91
benazir bhutto, the most popular politician in pakistan was killed by the taliban. %$* 91
the taliban have attacked hundreds of police, killed hundreds of police officers and army soldiers. %$* 91
and as a result, the pakistani public, which used to view the taliban as sort of religious robin hoods, now see them largely as thugs. %$* 91
support for suicide bombing in pakistan dropped from 33 percent to five percent in the last several years. %$* 91
and the pakistani military have done significant military operations in swat, which is the tourist destination in the north of pakistan and also in southern waziristan. %$* 91
and it's not perfect, but the enemy of the perfect is not the reason we okay. %$* 91
and the pakistani government, military and public have already turned against the taliban in a very sizeable way because they understand that the taliban is now attacking the pakistani state. %$* 91
nir rosen. %$* 13
there's a very dangerous conflation here, though, because there's the pakistani taliban and afghan taliban. %$* 90
it's true, the pakistani state is fighting brutally the pakistani taliban. %$* 90
it's not fighting the afghan taliban. %$* 90
it's supporting the afghan taliban. %$* 90
in fact, the afghan taliban has criticized the pakistani taliban for fighting the pakistani state and told them they should come to afghanistan to fight the americans in afghanistan. %$* 90
but i think it's not only important to look at what the pakistanis are doing to afghanistan and to us-- %$* 90
it's important to look at what we're doing to the pakistanis. %$* 90
we've driven-- %$* 90
pakistan is a much more crucial country, with nuclear weapons, conflict with india. %$* 90
we have driven the taliban into pakistan. %$* 90
we've driven al-qaeda into pakistan. %$* 90
and our drone strikes now are not only pushing the taliban and al-qaeda into pakistan, but further into karachi into sindh, punjab. %$* 90
we are destabilizing pakistan, a much more important and dangerous country. %$* 90
just by being in afghanistan, we're also pushing drug networks out of afghanistan into pakistan. %$* 90
it's our presence which is threatening this crucial country, which, of course, can go into conflict with india, et cetera. %$* 90
thank you, nir. %$* 13
and i-- %$* 13
can i ask a question here? %$* 89
i mean, what is-- %$* 89
what is more likely to produce a stable and pro western pakistan in the future? %$* 89
is it an american defeat in afghanistan? %$* 89
is it a withdrawal that will be hailed by the jihadists as a glorious victory against another super power, one that will allow their allies and the taliban to take power in afghanistan? %$* 89
is that going to be good for the future of pakistan? %$* 89
or conversely, what about the future-- %$* 89
of pakistan if we are in fact able to stabilize afghanistan to shore up the friendly pro- western government there which works with the west to fight terrorism? %$* 89
what is the impact of that going to be on pakistan. %$* 89
i think my point is-- %$* 89
should be pretty clear, which is that if we are concerned about the future of pakistan-- %$* 89
and i certainly am-- %$* 89
then running out of afghanistan is not the strategy to pursue. %$* 89
that will in fact weaken the government of pakistan and destabilize it, whereas if we can stabilize afghanistan, that will do much to strengthen the forces of moderation in pakistan. %$* 89
john. %$* 88
just to answer that real quick? %$* 88
very quick, yeah, matthew hoh. %$* 13
two things: one, does al-qaeda receive more recruits because we occupy two muslim countries or because of a supposed loss in afghanistan? %$* 88
and also, too, we're not talking about losing or running from afghanistan. %$* 88
we're talking about getting a political process that resolves 30 years of conflict in afghanistan. %$* 88
in 2000-- %$* 88
go into pakistan. %$* 88
in 2001, pakistan had two insurgencies. %$* 88
they had insurgency in sindh and an insurgency in balochistan. %$* 88
they didn't have insurgency in the pashtun areas. %$* 88
there were extremist groups there, but there was not an insurgency. %$* 88
the pakistani taliban did not come into existence until 2006 or 2007 and had popular support from the pashtun people until we had the islamabad government send the army into there, which hadn't occurred for 40, 50 years, and until our drones start showing up. %$* 88
so if anything, if you look at what's happened to pakistan in the last 10 years, our presence and our continued escalation of afghanistan, that has destabilized pakistan. %$* 88
so, again, we’re not talking about cutting and running from afghanistan. %$* 88
we're talking about having a political process that ends 30 years of war that stabilizes not just afghanistan but pakistan as well. %$* 88
all right. %$* 13
i want to go to some questions from you and invite you back into it. %$* 13
and again, thank you for those comments that actually helped move this debate along. %$* 13
our motion is “afghanistan is a lost cause.” i'm john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
this is a debate from intelligence squared u.s. %$* 13
we have two teams of two arguing it out; afghanistan is a lost cause from the skirball center for the performing arts at new york university. %$* 13
and i'd now like to go to questions from the audience. %$* 13
and, again, on questions, i'd like them to be on topic on the motion. %$* 13
i'd like them to be brief. %$* 13
i'd like them to be questions. %$* 13
i'm going to go-- %$* 13
yes, please. %$* 13
hi. %$* 19
i'm dina temple raston with national public radio. %$* 19
and i wonder if you could discuss a little bit something that you touched on but really didn't dive into, and that is the nascent peace talks between the taliban and the karzai government. %$* 19
and for matthew, for you, and for peter bergen, for you, could you please explain how these peace talks fit into your view of the motion, afghanistan is a lost cause, and whether or not they are at all meaningful? %$* 19
thank you. %$* 13
and that was a question. %$* 13
okay. %$* 91
peter bergen. %$* 13
three weeks ago, an expert on afghanistan discussed this very topic. %$* 91
and he said that-- %$* 91
talking about the-- %$* 91
peace negotiations with the taliban, he said reports of the u.s.being involved with efforts to reconcile elements of the insurgency with the karzai government are reports that provide hope, albeit cautious hope that a more sensible and rational u.s.policy is taking hold. %$* 91
the same expert also said that he had cautious optimism for afghanistan as a result of these talks. %$* 91
that expert was matthew hoh. %$* 91
just three weeks ago, he said there was hope and cautious optimism because of these talks. %$* 91
now he's saying it's a lost cause. %$* 91
which one is it, matthew? %$* 91
you guys do your homework. %$* 88
sorry. %$* 91
and you should too. %$* 13
well, you know, they're both true. %$* 88
they are. %$* 88
i mean-- %$* 88
okay. %$* 91
if you look at-- %$* 88
again, if you look at this conflict that's been going on for 30 years, if you understand that the taliban are not a monolithic organization, that they're composed of multiple local groups with legitimate political grievances, then there is a need to negotiate to end the conflict. %$* 88
go home tonight and look up a thing called the national strategy for victory in iraq in 2005.this was our document. %$* 88
and i worked on it when i was in the state department in 2005 after i came back from iraq my first time. %$* 88
go and look it up. %$* 88
we called it the nsvi.and it says the same things about the iraqi insurgency. %$* 88
it's monolithic. %$* 88
they're all terrorists. %$* 88
we can't negotiate with them. %$* 88
we can't leave iraq because it will become a safe haven for terrorism. %$* 88
so the same things we did in 2003 to 2006, in terms of lumping the iraqi insurgency together, calling them all terrorists, the same things we're doing now in afghanistan. %$* 88
what changed in iraq? %$* 88
and i can tell you when i was there in anbar province, where-- %$* 88
matthew, can you relate this to the question, to the question on the peace talks? %$* 13
yeah, sure. %$* 88
the point-- %$* 88
does it give you hope or not as you wrote three weeks ago? %$* 91
very cautious hope that there will be a breakthrough that we would start to peel off elements of the insurgency and shatter the insurgency and splinter the insurgency. %$* 88
cautious hope and lost cause are completely different things. %$* 91
well, it depends what the cause is. %$* 88
yeah. %$* 18
the cause-- %$* 88
i think i wasn't-- %$* 88
i probably didn't have this debate in mind when i was talking to-- %$* 88
i mean-- %$* 88
you know, but honestly-- %$* 88
do you take back what you wrote three weeks ago? %$* 91
no, of course not. %$* 88
no. %$* 88
okay. %$* 91
so then cautious hope and optimism. %$* 91
cautious hope and optimism for talks to end the conflict through-- %$* 88
i think i've been clear the entire night about the need for reconciliation. %$* 88
nir rosen. %$* 13
first of all, there are no talks. %$* 90
and petraeus has done his best to nix those talks because he's adopting a very aggressive militaristic approach to kandahar which isn’t even counterinsurgency, it's going back to the russian operations of '83 and '84.but if afghanistan is a cause in terms of a military strategy, with u.s.strategy as a very militaristic one and military focused, then, yes, there's no hope. %$* 90
but if you approach it as a political problem, then there is hope and that hope involves some kind of political settlement and abandoning this increased militaristic approach, but it just depends on how you define your terms. %$* 90
another question? %$* 13
can i just reply to %$* 89
all right, max boot before the %$* 13
because i think nir must be talking about a different war than the one i'm familiar with, comparing what we're doing in kandahar, for example, to what the soviets did in the 1980s when they leveled the city and killed hundreds of thousands of people, hey, i was in kandahar this summer, we're not leveling the city, buddy, okay? %$* 89
now, in terms of negotiations and how wonderful they are, there is no question that ultimately at some point a lot of this insurgency will be dealt with through negotiations, but the question is-- %$* 89
how do you set the conditions for those negotiations? %$* 89
what general petraeus recognizes and which i don't think nir rosen seems to understand, is that first you have to convince your enemies they are not going to win at gunpoint. %$* 89
as one nato officer put it to me in kabul, he said, sure, you can give the-- %$* 89
first you have to knock the taliban on their back, then you can give them a helping hand up. %$* 89
they have to be convinced they are not going to win. %$* 89
at that point they will start to negotiate seriously. %$* 89
we are only now starting the process of convincing them that they will not win because we are only now implementing a serious counterinsurgency strategy on the ground. %$* 89
as we have more success in pacifying areas like nawa, or marjah, or kandahar, then you will see the insurgents coming to the table and a lot of them giving up and stopping the fight. %$* 89
but they're not going to do it if they see americans on the way out. %$* 89
i want to move on, and you can bring this in your closing statements. %$* 13
sir. %$* 13
hi, my name is ali grebe and i just wanted to challenge peter bergen on the specifics of something he said before. %$* 18
he said that the afghani taliban hadn't repudiated al-qaeda at all, and that's true in the sense of the strict repudiation word for word. %$* 18
but ahmed rashid reported in february of this year in the new york review books that mullah omar, who's the head of the afghani taliban and the had pledged that if the taliban were allowed to return to afghanistan that there would be no interference from foreigners, and then also there would be no threat from afghanistan to any neighboring or outside countries. %$* 18
and that's what i was just wondering, for comments on that %$* 18
he would say that, wouldn't he? %$* 91
i mean, come on, this is a guy who was prepared to-- %$* 91
mullah omar was prepared to lose everything on the point of principle that he wasn't going to hand over bin laden, and he did. %$* 91
this does not suggest that he's going to be henry kissinger in some future negotiation with us. %$* 91
this is a religious fanatic who very closely allied to another religious fanatic, osama bin laden. %$* 91
i was there under the taliban. %$* 91
i can tell you that a doctor was earning six dollars a month, the world bank stopped measuring the economic indicators of the country because there were none, all women were imprisoned in their homes, and all girls were not allowed to go to school. %$* 91
this is the-- %$* 91
mullah omar is not a rational actor with whom we can do business. %$* 91
and it would be a moral catastrophe for us to allow him to come back into power in some shape or form. %$* 91
another question? %$* 13
ma’am, yes, and if you could stand up, please %$* 13
hi. %$* 19
my name is lauren i'm a student at nyu. %$* 19
if you do pull out of afghanistan, how do you know that al-qaeda will not come back, because would it not be possible for them to use the fragmentation that is within afghanistan and the weak government to come back into power and to use it as a means of recruiting people? %$* 19
i’m not sure that you're saying to pull out of afghanistan %$* 13
no, but— %$* 90
nir, take the question. %$* 13
if we were to pull out and al-qaeda came back to afghanistan, i think that would be the greatest thing because right now they’re in pakistan where we can’t actually get to them, we can’t find them, there’s a much great infrastructure for al-qaeda to hide in pakistan, dense urban areas in karachi and other places where they can blend with the population. %$* 90
in afghanistan, if they have bases, whenever you want you can pound the hell out of them. %$* 90
drop b-52 bombs on them be as brutal as you want. %$* 90
i think it’s also important to remember, al-qaeda is not that big of a threat. %$* 90
they’ve had one success, september 11, and that's it. %$* 90
so we shouldn't exaggerate this threat of al-qaeda in the first place. %$* 90
i just want to go to max boot. %$* 13
nir’s thesis being al-qaeda coming back into afghanistan would not be such a bad thing because you can get them there. %$* 13
well, you know, that’s the strategy we tried prior to 9/11.we can see how well that worked with cruise missile strikes on al-qaeda training camps in afghanistan. %$* 89
and frankly, nir's statement just now i think puts a lot of his comments into perspective because he’s saying the taliban aren’t much of a threat, but he seems to think that al- qaeda isn’t much of a threat either, so do we face any actual threats out there, nir, i’d like to know? %$* 89
the taliban certainly are no threat. %$* 90
you’ve only had one afghan ever try to attack america and that was zazi here in new york and he spent most of his life here. %$* 90
you don’t have any afghan taliban trying to attack the u.s. outside of afghanistan, of course where they’re occupied. %$* 90
except in times square just in may. %$* 91
pakistani taliban, not afghan. %$* 90
distinction without a difference. %$* 91
they are essentially the same group of people. %$* 91
there’s a lot of grumbling from the audience. %$* 13
when i was bringing up iraq before, this is what we did for three or four years in iraq. %$* 88
we conflated all the groups together, did not address any of the local grievances that those groups had. %$* 88
they had been usurped from power, they were excluded from the government. %$* 88

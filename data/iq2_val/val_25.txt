good evening, everyone. %$* 13
good evening, everyone. %$* 13
i would like to begin our evening by introducing the ceo of intelligence squared us, mr. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
thank you all for being here and welcome. %$* 1
you know, there’s not much of a debate about whether mainstream media is declining. %$* 1
the network evening news audience is shrinking, daily newspapers are folding, established magazine titles are being shut down. %$* 1
nearly one of every five newspaper journalists has been fired in the last couple of years. %$* 1
increasingly people get their news from the internet and from cable channels. %$* 1
in the past two years the number of people in the us going online for news has jumped 19 percent. %$* 1
advertisers are moving to google and to other non-traditional sources. %$* 1
but there is a very interesting debate about whether these developments leave us better off or worse off. %$* 1
now no one seriously questions that a free press is an essential national value. %$* 1
and a free press does not come cheap. %$* 1
the major networks and leading newspapers have traditionally spent heavily on the news, they support foreign news bureaus, investigative reporting, in-depth news analysis, fact-checking and other quality controls. %$* 1
so why might we say, good riddance. %$* 1
perhaps it’s because mainstream media did exercise extraordinary power, to shape the national agenda, and our perception of events. %$* 1
might we be better off getting our news from an unfiltered internet, to which all bloggers and news aggregators have equal access. %$* 1
should we not encourage a diversity of voices competing to provide information and analysis. %$* 1
can a network of bloggers tell us more about events on the ground than a reporter in a hotel bar in baghdad or cairo? %$* 1
or could we conceivably enjoy the best of both worlds, as mainstream media reinvents itself to thrive in a digital age. %$* 1
these are interesting questions, i think we’re going to have a lot of fun hearing them debated tonight, and it’s my pleasure to turn the evening back to john donvan. %$* 1
thank you. %$* 13
and may i just invite one more round of applause for the person who makes all of this possible, robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
well, welcome, everyone, to another debate from intelligence squared us, i’m john donvan of abc news, and it is my honor once again to serve as host and moderator, as the six debaters you see sharing the stage with me here at the skirball center for the performing arts at new york university. %$* 13
three teams—sorry, two teams, three against three, will be debating this motion, “good riddance to the mainstream media.” and i know that we have a hall full of journalists here, a topic that is close to many of our hearts, if not many of our throats. %$* 13
but it is an important topic for debate, and that’s what this is, it is a debate, a contest. %$* 13
there will be winners and losers tonight, and you the audience will be our judges, by the time the debate ends you will have voted twice, once before the debate, and once again after the debate on whether you side with or against the motion. %$* 13
you pick the winners. %$* 13
so let’s move on to our preliminary vote, and if you again look to the keypads on the left of your seats %$* 13
that will be your little voting machine. %$* 13
press number one if you agree with the motion, “good riddance to the mainstream media,” press number two if you disagree with the motion, and press number three if you are undecided. %$* 13
and if you make a mistake, just correct the mistake and the system will only record your last vote. %$* 13
do you have to log in first? %$* 130
you do not have to log in. %$* 13
you are logged in. %$* 13
we hope. %$* 13
all right, we’re going to lock it out %$* 13
so let’s get to the debate, our topic is “good riddance to the mainstream media,” and this is a contest in which we hope to hear a clash of ideas and logic, and wit and perhaps humor, as each team tries to change your minds and tries to persuade you to their point of view, and speaking first for the motion, “good riddance to the mainstream media,” i’d like to introduce michael wolff, who in a way has one of the most mainstream of all media positions as a columnist for vanity fair but he also for some time has had a position on the other side of the technological divide having been involved in many internet startups, including newser.com which michael, you say, has as one of its goals to kill newspapers, is that correct? %$* 13
well, also to make me rich. %$* 131
make you rich, ladies and gentlemen %$* 13
is that working out? %$* 13
oh yes, of course. %$* 131
michael wolff— %$* 13
always— %$* 131
—ladies and gentlemen. %$* 13
i went to work for the new york times in 1973, and i was going to say that that probably makes me one of the people who’s been in this business in this room the longest. %$* 131
but then i notice you’re an old crowd. %$* 131
my mother went to work as a daily reporter in 1942, my father began as an ad man in 1946, after the war. %$* 131
so, the thing that i know is that this business is always changing. %$* 131
so, the idea that somebody is going to defend the status quo of this business is to me a little silly. %$* 131
and my first point is, that we ought to remember, that this business, the business that those guys are going to defend, is a new creation. %$* 131
it’s at most, 20 years old. %$* 131
and it’s essentially— and the other thing that’s going to happen is that they’re going to talk about the news business, and that’s not the proposition, the proposition is the media business as it should be, because the news business has been subsumed by this superstructure. %$* 131
now this superstructure, which essentially is five companies which dominate the landscape— time warner, viacom-cbs, newscorp, disney, and nbc universal. %$* 131
what these companies are are—listen to this—more than 1,000 independent media companies, which in the past 20 years have been aggregated into five. %$* 131
so what they’re going to be defending, is actually a business theory. %$* 131
and the theory is we bring all these companies together, and we create value. %$* 131
here’s the point. %$* 131
that theory has been all but utterly exploded. %$* 131
disproven. %$* 131
break it down into its component parts. %$* 131
look at its constituencies. %$* 131
from an audience point of view, the audience has been in flight for 20 years. %$* 131
just yesterday, what we’ve learned is that there was, newspapers have lost another 10 percent of circulation, some newspapers are down in a year, 25 percent. %$* 131
you can see those numbers not just in newspapers, across the media landscape. %$* 131
television networks, books, magazines, the music business, the movie business. %$* 131
and now the cable business. %$* 131
people are in flight from what was supposed to be the bastion of mainstream media. %$* 131
this is an extraordinary moment, it is a moment in which you see literally breakdown at every level. %$* 131
the %$* 131
you have—it’s not only—you have an audience flight, you have an advertiser flight. %$* 131
what happens with advertisers, it used to be that consumer brands, you had 90 percent of consumer brand spending was in the mainstream media, that’s down to under 50 percent, why is that the case. %$* 131
because it doesn’t work anymore. %$* 131
you have from a shareholder perspective, and this is key. %$* 131
shareholder perspective, what you have is—well actually you’ve been screwed if you’re a shareholder in a modern media company. %$* 131
media moguls rich, shareholders across the spectrum of these companies, are underwater, not one of these companies, in %$* 131
20 years has kept pace with the s&p. %$* 131
this is a devastating result. %$* 131
what you have is your customers, your—the consumer, the advertiser, and the marketplace itself, saying that there is something phenomenally wrong here. %$* 131
technology. %$* 131
the media is a technology business. %$* 131
that’s what it is. %$* 131
that’s what it has always been. %$* 131
technology changes, the media changes. %$* 131
there is no media without technology. %$* 131
we’re %$* 131
we’ve come to a funny moment however in this business because the mainstream media is run by people who are fundamentally technology-phobes. %$* 131
they don’t get it, they don’t want to get it, they’re averse to it, they resist it. %$* 131
they are lost when it comes to making plans about it. %$* 131
i spent a lotta time in the recent past with rupert murdoch who runs i would say the leading-edge media company, and he runs it with an iron fist. %$* 131
he doesn’t run it with a computer because he doesn’t use one, he doesn’t run it with email because he doesn’t get email. %$* 131
and he can’t get that cell phone to work, he’s always kind of waving it %$* 131
in the air. %$* 131
what you’re going to hear here tonight is that the media is necessary for the commonweal. %$* 131
an informed citizenry is what this nation is about. %$* 131
the media may be flawed but it delivers us what we need to know. %$* 131
that is self-serving crap. %$* 131
i— the new york times, is a good newspaper, sometimes. %$* 131
the washington post is a good newspaper. %$* 131
the la times before it became a bad newspaper was a good newspaper. %$* 131
but after that, it’s off the cliff, it’s oblivion. %$* 131
the news business in this country is nothing to be proud of. %$* 131
what— you know, i think the thing to remember here—i mean the really important thing is that something else is happening, something is %$* 131
this is easy. %$* 131
change—and i have four seconds—change is good. %$* 131
and it’s happening and we are part of it, and we’re going to all tell our grandchildren that, we were here, we saw the monster die, and we saw the shock of the new— %$* 131
and— thank you. %$* 131
michael wolff, your time is up. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
and— thank you. %$* 131
i want to point out, i did not give you the structure of the evening, we are doing three rounds, round 1 we’re in now is opening statements, round 2, the debaters will go head to head, in round 3 we’ll have brief closing statements. %$* 13
we’re in— this is round 1, opening statements by each debater in turn, they are seven minutes each, the closing statements will be two minutes each. %$* 13
now, moving on, the motion is “good riddance to the mainstream media” and here to argue first against the motion is phil bronstein. %$* 13
phil bronstein began his career as a television reporter and over the years moved to print and became ultimately the editor of the san francisco chronicle, was there during the most difficult of times, and it was he who called the staff together, and said, the business model is broken, and no one knows how to fix it. %$* 13
phil, was there a “yet”? %$* 13
yet. %$* 132
“yet,” in that, ladies and gentlemen, phil bronstein. %$* 13
well, you all look very young to me. %$* 132
it’s a challenge to try and defend the vitality of something that’s already been declared dead. %$* 132
and no one has been quicker to declare it dead than people who have been preachers of the mainstream media, rushing to write the obituary. %$* 132
but let’s— first of all, i should caution you, we should be very careful tonight, because, we can’t touch on certain topics because, we could all go to jail if we do. %$* 132
what am i thinking, of course we can’t go to jail, we can talk about anything we want. %$* 132
and one of the reasons we can talk about anything we want is because the institutions that have made up the mainstream media, not over the past 20 or 30 years but over the last hundred years, have provided the authority, and the experience and frankly, the money, to stand toe to toe with government and all-powerful institutions and individuals. %$* 132
for your rights, for all of our rights, and for the benefit of all of us. %$* 132
i have some notes here because i’m a newspaper person, i like reliability to the extent that i get it. %$* 132
a few years ago, we had two reporters at the chronicle facing 18 months in prison each, on the balco steroids story, for refusing to be tools of government prosecution and in fact for just being reporters. %$* 132
well, we spent two years, in addition to the time we spent on the story, two years defending these reporters, and a million dollars. %$* 132
eve burton, our chief corporate counsel at hearst, who personally oversaw this case, i think is here tonight. %$* 132
that’s something that i’m not so sure, that these other emerging operations in media can do. %$* 132
do they have the money. %$* 132
does talking points memo which does great work have the money, to do that. %$* 132
have the will to do that. %$* 132
and you know the new york times the other day just said that barack obama, about barack obama, the cover-up continues. %$* 132
so you may like this president more than you like the last one, but you may not like the next one. %$* 132
because i can tell you from the balco case experience, that that was a concerted effort on the part of the bush administration, to go after the press, and its ability to report. %$* 132
i’m standing here very humbly tonight in the very long shadows of a lotta great editors, ben bradlee, john carroll, marty barron, gene roberts, who are known for things, other than encounters with large reptiles, they’re known for working to change our world very profoundly. %$* 132
they do stories about the deaths of 300 kids in the washington public school system. %$* 132
fraudulent fertility packages, walter reade hospital took at least half a year to do, sexual abuse by— of kids by members of the catholic clergy, the boston globe, a year to do that. %$* 132
when bill keller went toe to toe with the bush administration on domestic wiretapping you may not have liked the results of the negotiations but the fact that there was a debate, served us all. %$* 132
served us all. %$* 132
i’m not here to defend a business proposition. %$* 132
as, i’ve already said, the business model’s broken, so i’m not going to do that. %$* 132
what i am defending is the idea of sustained professional journalism done with integrity and done in the public interest. %$* 132
and that is something that mainstream media has supported, we’ve gotten lost in all this business model discussion and disintermediation and granularization and it just, doesn’t get to the point. %$* 132
our death by the way, would be i think a little untimely for the 50 million people who still pay to get a daily newspaper, for the 74 million people who go online, a month, of daily newspaper sites, and even for the $38 billion worth of advertising that still exists. %$* 132
but, another issue i think that we should raise, in terms of the service that we provide, that mainstream media has supported all these years, freedom of information act requests. %$* 132
now, freedom of information act requests are sort of like a new york apartment with a view. %$* 132
they’re hard to get, it’s expensive, it’s time-consuming, but boy, what a result. %$* 132
these are windows, on very dark places occasionally and very corrupt places. %$* 132
lucy dalglish, and i’ll read the quote, director of reporters committee for freedom of the press, “access litigation has dried up, because of what’s happened to mainstream media.” and a public defender in georgia wondered, quote, “can underfunded bloggers, are they able to carry the financial burden of opening our courtrooms.” and that georgia case in fact started, or was based on a case that—where the riverside press enterprise, went to court to expensively—to open the courtroom. %$* 132
so, look. %$* 132
this isn’t just domestic, and it isn’t just about the government. %$* 132
seth mydans, an old colleague of mine from southeast asia, said not too long ago, when he shows up at places in southeast asia, for stories that matter to all of us %$* 132
he’s often the only reporter. %$* 132
well we’re supposed to be the witnesses to history. %$* 132
where are the witnesses? %$* 132
how are those witnesses going to be provided. %$* 132
i don’t think they’ll be provided solely by tweets from people on the streets of tehran. %$* 132
an old colleague and mentor of mine, max vanzi of the associated press, when i went to the philippines for the first time he said, here’s a clue. %$* 132
nothing is ever what it seems. %$* 132
and i thought, oh, that’s a lotta help. %$* 132
but, the hearst corporation, and the examiner at that point took care to give me five years to learn what that meant, and by the end of that five years i knew. %$* 132
you want to talk about corporate greed? %$* 132
well, we’ve also talked about nonprofit models, the chronicle’s been unwillingly a nonprofit %$* 132
newspaper for many years now. %$* 132
but despite that fact, because of a commitment to the kinds of things that i’m talking about, that are so important to us, the chronicle remains in business. %$* 132
so from the new york times taking on boss tweed in the 1870s, to a young william randolph hearst supporting blue-collar workers %$* 132
the public has been very well-served by the mainstream media, and at a minimum we can’t afford to let it go, and kiss it off, because it’s entirely unclear what other form of journalism, support for that journalism, is going to be successful. %$* 132
i’m under, thank you very much. %$* 132
thank you, phil bronstein, our motion is “good riddance to the mainstream media.” and now speaking for the motion, jim vandehei, and jim had the perfect job at a great paper, a respected political reporter at the washington post, he gave it all up, to start a start-up news organization. %$* 13
the good news is it turned out to be politico.com. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, jim vandehei. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 133
i’m here to tell you that you not only look young, you look good too. %$* 133
and i urge you to vote for the proposition because, to be blunt, i think new media is better than old media, and i think that we’re the hope for them. %$* 133
i think—i agree with most of what phil said, i agree that all that investment, all the accountability that old journalism has done, is great and that we need those values. %$* 133
but there’s also another side to mainstream media and another side to new media. %$* 133
for starters, mainstream media, for the longest time, i don’t think it was always as good as portrayed or always as great as we sort of mythicize. %$* 133
and, for the longest time it was basically run by old white men who are left of center who are deciding how all of us view the news, the only diversity was how much hair they had left or whether they drank gin or scotch. %$* 133
and what new media’s done is it’s injected a ton of vitality and a ton of competition into the media. %$* 133
and it’s also created, it gives you ideological, racial, and gender diversity that we never had before, and it gives all of us, all us news junkies, everyone in this room obviously cares a lot about news— it gives us a whole new menu of information to choose from. %$* 133
i also think, i—my background is i worked at the wall street journal and the washington post and then we started politico three years ago, so i think i’ve seen both sides of it. %$* 133
and i can tell you there’s probably a lot of businessmen and women in the audience because this is new york. %$* 133
and i think, i think your stomach would be turned if you went into some newspapers to see how they’re run, because they had profits that were so high for so long, an almost like not-for-profit mentality took on and there became distance between the institutions that were covering the news and the readers. %$* 133
and i think that, it led to a real disconnect between what institutions were producing and what readers wanted, and i saw this all the time when i was at those institutions, and when i was there three years ago at the washington post %$* 133
and i include myself in that, i saw online, i saw the web as a nuisance, i wanted to write front-page stories for a newspaper, despite the fact that i could look at the web metrics and see that i was getting 10 or 20 times as many people reading my story online, that that’s where people wanted the news. %$* 133
and i think that creates a culture that i don’t think works for the modern news consumer. %$* 133
and what new media’s done is it’s ripped down that wall, between the institution and the reader, and it’s opened up, i think it’s made it more transparent and it’s allowed you the reader to participate more in what we’re doing and even some of you to participate in the journalism that we’re doing. %$* 133
i also want to clear up some of the myths about new media, because i think all the things that phil said are really important and i think %$* 133
you always have to remember that new media is in its infancy and that, it’s going to grow and it’s going to mature. %$* 133
and you’re going to hear stuff tonight about how there’s a demise of serious journalism, that you know, that if you look online, if you look at new media it’s just not as serious and substantive. %$* 133
i’ve been in washington for 15 years, and i would say that the coverage of the health care debate, has been the most substantive, the deepest coverage, the most accountable coverage that i’ve seen of a domestic policy issue in some time. %$* 133
and the best of it is coming not from the mainstream media, but from outside of the mainstream media. %$* 133
whether it’s jonathan cohn from the new republic or ezra klein who’s doing his stuff sort of deep down in the washingtonpost.com, whether it’s politico where we have three or four reporters just doing the policy element, we have investigative reporters doing the accountability element. %$* 133
huffington post often has their reporters dispatched to this issue. %$* 133
dedicates a lot of its home page to this issue. %$* 133
you have propublica, a not-for-profit organization run by paul steiger who i used to work with at the wall street journal, and the center for public integrity, doing some accountability reporting and making that available to readers throughout the country. %$* 133
you have the kaiser foundation %$* 133
which has stepped in and has started to produce non-partisan news about the health care debate, a lot of it about the human element of it, they have 20 reporters, that stuff’s available to any newspaper that wants to run it, so for people who care, there’s more information than ever, and it’s coming mostly from new media. %$* 133
you’re also going to hear about the demise of foreign coverage. %$* 133
and i think that’s a serious problem. %$* 133
but we didn’t start this fire. %$* 133
it was dying before new media ever came along, it’s really expensive to do foreign coverage. %$* 133
and guess who is actually creating that bridge until we can figure out how to finance it. %$* 133
it’s new media. %$* 133
it’s global post which was started by some folks over at the boston globe. %$* 133
they have 65 reporters around the country that are doing work on a freelance basis in every corner of the country. %$* 133
during the aftermath of the iranian debate which was mentioned in phil’s column, or in phil’s comments. %$* 133
the best coverage was often online, huffington post took the above-the-fold part of its home page, and the huffington post gets more traffic now than the washington post, and dedicated it to a running blog where you had video and text and audio coming in from iran, so you could have a peek into what was happening on the streets that you never could’ve had in the old days, and i think that is a good thing. %$* 133
andrew sullivan was doing a similar thing on his blog. %$* 133
he had 1.2 million visitors in one day, which is more than you would get people reading a newspaper, all but the top three newspapers that are out there. %$* 133
david wood, who is married to someone that works at politico-- %$* 133
he was a foreign policy reporter covering afghanistan on the ground. %$* 133
got laid off because of cutbacks at mainstream media. %$* 133
who hired him? %$* 133
it’s american online politics daily. %$* 133
it’s new media that’s giving these people a chance to do journalism. %$* 133
and i do believe that as new media matures, we’re going to take over that social responsibility of funding the expensive to do journalism, like accountability and like foreign policy reporting because you can’t cover anything if you’re not in business. %$* 133
and i think that it’s new media that’s going to crack the code on the business models that actually work. %$* 133
you’re also going to hear from that side on the demise of accountability and investigative reporting. %$* 133
i think new media is leading the charge and they’re leading it by keeping all the mainstream media reporters employed. %$* 133
a lot of the best people in the business-- %$* 133
bill hamilton was bob woodward’s editor at the washington post, one of the best editors in washington-- %$* 133
we, he just came over to politico to help do our investigative stories and our longer form stories. %$* 133
huffington post started the investigative fund, which is a not-for-profit arm that does investigative reporting. %$* 133
it’s going to be run by larry roberts, who is running investigations for the washington post. %$* 133
propublica, which i mentioned a little bit earlier, has thirty-three reporters, including jeff gerth from the new york times, and many other people have been doing investigative reporting for a long time. %$* 133
i mentioned talking points memo, and phil was saying, well, can they make money? %$* 133
is there an ability for them to finance the type of journalism that takes on government? %$* 133
well, i think so. %$* 133
they just got another round of funding. %$* 133
they’re doubling the size of their staff. %$* 133
they’re starting a washington bureau and they’re predicting that they can get to a path to profitability. %$* 133
and i believe that because politico’s done it. %$* 133
in year three, with a hundred and twenty employees, doing that type of journalism, we’re profitable. %$* 133
and i think it proves that this works. %$* 133
so i urge all of you to vote for the, the resolution because new media has given journalism the tools, the tricks, the metabolism and the journalists to succeed. %$* 133
thank you. %$* 133
a reminder of where we are. %$* 13
we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i’m john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
we have six debaters on the stage here, two teams of three. %$* 13
and they are arguing over this motion: good riddance to the mainstream media. %$* 13
you have heard three opening statements and now on to the fourth. %$* 13
i’d like to welcome katrina vanden heuvel, who is editor of the nation-- %$* 13
a small magazine with a fiercely loyal following, in many ways a targeted elite readership that would be the envy of many online websites. %$* 13
however, the nation is how old? %$* 13
a hundred and forty-four, and i feel it every day. %$* 134
ladies and gentlemen, katrina vanden-- %$* 13
so you look real young. %$* 134
you not only look young, but you look fabulous. %$* 134
okay. %$* 134
i-- %$* 134
ah heh. %$* 134
i never imagined that as editor and publisher of the nation i’d be standing here against the resolution: good riddance to the mainstream media. %$* 134
for a hundred and forty- four years the nation has challenged the limits, exposed the flaws of what we call the msn.let me quote an old media guy, antonio gramsci: we are witnesses to the old media order dying. %$* 134
but a new one is not yet born. %$* 134
and jim vandehei can talk about all of those examples. %$* 134
but propublica, for example, is very keen and explicit about partnering with what might be called legacy old media publications to get the big bang they want for their stories-- %$* 134
the new york times, the washington post. %$* 134
michael wolff, newser basically lives off of aggregating mainstream media sites. %$* 134
so i think to say, good riddance to the mainstream media may get the testosterone flowing up here, but it distracts from the tough work of salvaging and reviving quality journalism in newsrooms that will hold accountable the powerful. %$* 134
so i’m ready to separate my frustration with the many weaknesses of the mainstream media from a recognition of the valuable role it plays. %$* 134
and i would, you know, suggest to anyone to go back and look, not just twenty years ago, but at the last two years of the pulitzer prizes or the hellman media award, which i am on, and look at who is winning awards to reform, correct, shame, expose-- %$* 134
and it’s still largely the mainstream media. %$* 134
i’m not going to speak in ways i was going to about my frustration with the mainstream media. %$* 134
you can imagine it, from the run-up to last year’s financial meltdown and most centrally, the iraq war. %$* 134
so many mainstream media outlets have operated as stenographers to power, not as tough, hardheaded reporters. %$* 134
and this is a real problem, but this is not about throwing out the baby with the bath water. %$* 134
it’s not defending the indefensible. %$* 134
it is about talking about, yes, the capacity of institutions for the health of our democracy. %$* 134
and for someone to say, oh, it’s just the commonweal and you’re going to hear about people who want to protect the health of our democracy, i consider quality, independent reporting a public good. %$* 134
and for all the frustration the mainstream media has caused us, we can’t live without it until we have some idea of what’s going to replace it. %$* 134
and i would argue right now, nobody has a clear idea. %$* 134
the fact is that nobody but institutions like the new york times, the washington post, the wall street journal, excluding the nutty editorial pages, and a small group of regional papers do most of the reporting in this country that the rest of us depend on to try to hold power accountable. %$* 134
and yeah, there are mistakes. %$* 134
but it’s the hardworking reporter, whether in congress, the federal bureaucracy. %$* 134
you talked about ezra klein, jim. %$* 134
fair enough, he’s done some great work on the health care. %$* 134
he’s at the washington post. %$* 134
state houses, city hall are on the warfronts, which, you know, unfortunately, we’re in a number of them. %$* 134
that is the expensive legwork, drudge work that allows our system to operate with even a dose of accountability. %$* 134
and that is expensive. %$* 134
so, for all their flaws, think about what newspapers-- %$* 134
and not just newspapers-- %$* 134
have done to provide a check on corruption and crooked politicians. %$* 134
think about not only what my partner, phil, spoke about-- %$* 134
journalists as not only witnesses to history but witnesses to oppression, journalistic enterprises keeping people safe, the most vulnerable from torture, oppression, injustice. %$* 134
people do awful things to each other but it’s worse in places where everybody is kept in the dark. %$* 134
twitter isn’t going to feed that right now. %$* 134
it is building their other sources-- %$* 134
global post, one of the better for-profit models. %$* 134
but the capacity is not there yet. %$* 134
at the local level there are reports which correlate a measurable decline in the quality of local democracy with the demise of local papers. %$* 134
so if the current journalistic model is unsustainable-- %$* 134
and you may think it is-- %$* 134
it’s up to those in our society who care about the continued ability to function as a democracy to find ways to fund reporting and insure the dissemination of quality journalism and information. %$* 134
this is a transformational moment. %$* 134
you’re going to hear from the other side. %$* 134
in crisis is opportunity. %$* 134
but it’s not a moment to toss out what has value, despite the flaws. %$* 134
there is a journalistic eco-system emerging out there but it is still very fragile. %$* 134
and to make the divide between old and new media into something, i would argue, artificially inflated by the other side, is to pit against each other what should be evolving together for the benefit of our country. %$* 134
so the fundamental problem remains. %$* 134
without powerful media institutions to take on the powerful on behalf of the rest of us we become more vulnerable as a society to those who would use their influence for private gain, damn the public consequences. %$* 134
we need a plan b and we don’t have one yet-- %$* 134
which, come to think of it, reminds me of how the bush administration went into iraq and we all know how that turned out. %$* 134
thank you. %$* 134
our next debater, who will be speaking for the motion: good riddance to the mainstream media, john hockenberry, has been, i would say, an old colleague of mine who has dabbled in the mainstream media, working at both nbc and abc.but his career has really been built around experimentation. %$* 13
i wager he is the only person in the hall who has written, produced and acted in a one-man show off-broadway. %$* 13
he’s been breaking the rules a long time. %$* 13
he is currently the host of public radio morning news program, the takeaway. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, john hockenberry. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 135
and thank you, katrina. %$* 135
i would say that new media has a lot to learn from the nation, which most these days resembles a blog, more than anything else in the mainstream media. %$* 135
and i think we owe the nation a debt. %$* 135
but speaking directly to people is nothing new. %$* 135
and the idea that our opponents would have us believe that somehow freedom of the press and the accountability of the media to hold institutions accountable and to keep them honest-- %$* 135
is somehow created by this for-profit structure that my colleague michael describes compellingly is dead and that my colleague jim describes is alive and well, at least in terms of its voice and its passion for accountability in the new media is at odds with what the constitution is about. %$* 135
the first amendment enabled the mainstream media and what have they done with the custodianship of this authority and this sense of holding us all accountable in this democracy and in doing the quality reporting that we so value? %$* 135
what have they done? %$* 135
what are we defending here? %$* 135
in september, the beatles rock band project was, a product,was unveiled. %$* 135
and it was extraordinarily successful and it was a profound argument to those in the corporate for-profit media in the music business that said somehow the means of distribution being freed from the record companies to people who actually play and use music was going to destroy music in some sense: that if the record business went away somehow music would be affected, that somehow the art form of music and the quality of music would be affected. %$* 135
what instead happened was people bought beatles rock band because they wanted the music. %$* 135
they also wanted the experience of being in the band. %$* 135
they wanted to part of the music itself. %$* 135
the technology enabled people suddenly to be a part of something that they were not permitted to be a part of. %$* 135
why? %$* 135
because the for-profit structure of mainstream media prevented them. %$* 135
it’s an old story in america. %$* 135
when the means of distribution goes out of the hands of the small set of individuals and individual institutions that control it, change is afoot. %$* 135
this is a moment we should embrace. %$* 135
all of the institutions described by our opponents were created in times of similar transformation. %$* 135
the hearst era, the new york times, the tabloid era in american history which formed the basis of the american revolution were all transformational moments when mainstream media was going away and new media was coming in. %$* 135
this is a moment to celebrate. %$* 135
good riddance to the mainstream media-- %$* 135
it should be written in the constitution. %$* 135
what are they trying to preserve here? %$* 135
john donvan says that i dabbled in the mainstream media. %$* 135
no, no, no-- %$* 135
i was handcuffed to the wall of the mainstream media, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 135
are we preserving the office culture and mentality at a television network where the senior editor of a news program holds an office poll to bet on the ratings for next morning’s program-- %$* 135
that culture? %$* 135
the obsession with the ages of the audience, as many jokes have been made here tonight-- %$* 135
this is something for the mainstream media. %$* 135
chasing eyeballs, commodifying eyeballs-- %$* 135
that’s the business. %$* 135
at the height of the war in iraq, that katrina suggests president bush led us into, the number one news broadcast reporting on that war was owned by a defense contractor. %$* 135
is that what we’re preserving here? %$* 135
is there not a conflict of interest in that situation? %$* 135
do we want to perpetuate that? %$* 135
are we saying that the mainstream media, which has so humored these wonderful journalists who get paid not as much as the executives at the for-profit media, but we want to have them around because they hold the media accountable. %$* 135
they hold the government accountable. %$* 135
this is a disservice, number one, to the first amendment. %$* 135
it’s a disservice to journalism. %$* 135
my first job as a journalist was a volunteer. %$* 135
now, i’m not saying that i would give up all of my income at this stage in my life, but the best journalists are people who don’t do it for the money. %$* 135
we want to create institutions that are all about doing it for the money and then we expect that the values of journalism and reporting are going to be maintained in that structure? %$* 135
and then when it changes and institutions like my colleague jim describes, politico.com-- %$* 135
where that i will do journalism whether i’m paid or not kind of passion comes into play-- %$* 135
we’re going to say, oh, my gosh, what’s happening? %$* 135
we’re throwing out the baby with the bath water. %$* 135
there’s something wrong here. %$* 135
we’ve gotta stop this. %$* 135
no, this is how it works. %$* 135
we do not look to the mainstream media to preserve the first amendment. %$* 135
we look to the first amendment to preserve the voices of the people-- %$* 135
on twitter who are holding the people accountable: on facebook, on social media, in blogs - - who are creating media and publishing media on their own. %$* 135
when the means of distribution leaves the hands of the few the many benefit. %$* 135
now, are we to judge the success of this transformation by who is making money or not? %$* 135
is that consistent with the values of we want to hold the government accountable? %$* 135
we want journalism to be the fifth estate. %$* 135
this is the mechanisms of democracy. %$* 135
if our gauge for the health of the media is whether some folks are making money then we’ve given up at the beginning. %$* 135
we basically conceded the debate and i won’t concede the debate. %$* 135
good riddance to the mainstream media. %$* 135
they had custodianship of this sense of authority for quite a while. %$* 135
and what did they bring us? %$* 135
two words: balloon boy. %$* 135
iraq. %$* 135
finally, to debate against the motion: good riddance to the mainstream media-- %$* 13
david carr, who is a media columnist and reporter for the new york times and also frequently capable of getting off a good line or two. %$* 13
his take on the situation we’re in now, a column from last september, he said: clearly, for the mainstream media the sky is falling. %$* 13
the question is whether anyone will be left to cover it. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, david carr. %$* 13
thank you, john. %$* 136
thank you, john hockenberry. %$* 136
i’ve had time to sit there for a little bit and really do some study on the audience and i want to co-sign, young, good looking, fabulous and i’m thinking, hot. %$* 136
it just came to me while i was looking. %$* 136
do i mention that because i want you to vote against this proposition, which is a per se dumb idea? %$* 136
why? %$* 136
number one: i should mention it’s how i get hamburgers for my family so there is a small bit of self-interest. %$* 136
but number two: these are really smart lawyers over here, but we got good facts. %$* 136
and the fact is, as opposed to what? %$* 136
you want us to take the weight off balloon boy. %$* 136
balloon boy was a trending topic on twitter for four days straight. %$* 136
it’s all twitter could talk about. %$* 136
they weren’t talking about the elections in iraq, the elections in afghanistan that have gone wrong. %$* 136
they weren’t talking about the bombings in iraq. %$* 136
they were talking about john and kate. %$* 136
twitter, i love twitter. %$* 136
i’m on there every damn day. %$* 136
but, but the best links in twitter are always, always into the data stream of mainstream media. %$* 136
because i work at the new york times i’m cast here as the dad in the basement at the teen party. %$* 136
cool guys over there, but us old fuddy-duddies. %$* 136
well, i work at the new york times. %$* 136
we have seventeen million people that come to our website. %$* 136
we put out a hundred videos every month. %$* 136
we have eighty blogs. %$* 136
we are fully engaged in the revolution that john talks about and we are at the vanguard, as is the washington post, as is the wall street journal. %$* 136
to suggest that somehow, a hand created citizen media is going to support-- %$* 136
for instance, the new york times has a news budget of two hundred and twenty million dollars, dozens of bureaus all over the world, many other news organizations, the same footprint. %$* 136
and we’re going to toss that out, which is the proposition-- %$* 136
toss that out and kick back and see what facebook turns up. %$* 136
i don’t think so. %$* 136
look, we’re gathered here around a bonfire and i stipulate to the business problems of the media. %$* 136
larger national newspapers, some of them are doing pretty well. %$* 136
small community papers are doing great. %$* 136
michael wants you to think that it’s five large media companies. %$* 136
it’s hundreds and hundreds of newspapers, local stations representing thousands and thousands of reporters who are bringing accountability to their community every day. %$* 136
i live in new jersey, which is a petri dish, a game preserve of corruption. %$* 136
the last time that they came out to get the bad guys in government it took three busses. %$* 136
do we need fewer reporters? %$* 136
do we need less accountability? %$* 136
the next time they’re going to need a choo-choo train, to there is, there is a delight in dancing around the bonfire, there’s a delight, in grave-dancing, i’m not a grave-dancer, you shouldn’t be either, you should vote against this proposition. %$* 136
the hybrid model that katrina talked about, where old and new media gradually developed ways of dealing with the business challenges of supporting independent accountability reporting, is what’s real. %$* 136
that’s what is true. %$* 136
it feels great to throw out the babies and stare into the bathwater so let’s go ahead and throw out a few. %$* 136
okay, there goes glenn beck %$* 136
there goes keith olbermann. %$* 136
it felt great. %$* 136
they’re gone. %$* 136
and it’s true that newspapers and broadcasters have used their monopoly powers to make millions but they’ve funded reporting over and above what the culture ever had. %$* 136
michael suggested the business is only 20 years old. %$* 136
paper i work at has been around for 150 years %$* 136
i think that part of the reason that people get riled up is it’s easy to dwell on the barnacles, but what would you really know about walter reade, what would you really know about katrina, what would you really know about 9/11.a million bloggers, typing a billion posts, i don’t think could get you to the place you need to be as a citizen to make important decisions, i consume new media, i believe in new media, i love politico, it’s a great brand build-up. %$* 136
but unless you got a millionaire that’s going to absorb a lotta losses to get things going— the shop i work for occasionally makes money. %$* 136
none of those guys can say that. %$* 136
okay. %$* 136
the model that they’re selling you has not demonstrated a business efficacy. %$* 136
and so, when jim himself described it as an industry that’s in its infancy, are we to take the old, and throw it away, and grab a nascent industry that’s done a world of good, but in very small numbers. %$* 136
global post which has been brought up. %$* 136
they’re paying reporters hundreds of dollars, who are there because legacy media assets put them out there, to train them out there. %$* 136
all of these new media enterprises, many of them, are staffed with legacy assets from old media and once those assets peter out they’re going to have to figure out a way to make money. %$* 136
i mean, i get it, i’m here from the new york times and i’ve received my orders from the dark overlords of the mainstream media. %$* 136
they put a chip in, i gotta tell you it hurts a little bit. %$* 136
and they also told me, if you fail tonight, do not come back to headquarters. %$* 136
so keep that in mind. %$* 136
look— it’s fun to build a bonfire, it’s not much fun to figure out what you’re going to replace it with. %$* 136
all the plucky citizens in the world, all the networked intelligence that you can come up with, are not going to give us what we need. %$* 136
which is real-time data as citizens on a variety of platforms from a variety of voices, to make an informed choice every time we step outside that door. %$* 136
vote against this proposal. %$* 136
and that concludes round 1 of this intelligence squared debate where the motion is, “good riddance to the mainstream media.” and i’ve now received the results of the preliminary vote, just to remind you and to remind listeners and viewers, our live audience voted before the debate began, their positions on our motion, “good riddance to the mainstream media.” they will vote again at the end of the debate and the team that changes the most minds over the course of the debate will be declared our winner. %$* 13
here are the preliminary results. %$* 13
before the debate 25 percent were for the motion, 50 percent against the motion, and 25 percent undecided. %$* 13
that is where things started, you will vote again at the conclusion to pick our winner. %$* 13
now we’re—now we’re moving on to round 2, this is our middle round in which the debaters address each other directly, and we will also take questions from you in the audience. %$* 13
and as you ponder your questions i’ll once again ask you to think in terms of real questions and to think in terms of something that’s very brief, and if you have to write it on a piece of paper it’s probably not what you want to do. %$* 13
something that is spontaneous, fresh, and real, will always work best. %$* 13
but i would like to ask a question of the side that is arguing against the motion, katrina, you said that there is no plan b, but what i heard from the other side sounded like, plan c, d, e, f, g, all the way through z, what— why do you feel that the argument particularly that jim vandehei made that there are plenty of already evident %$* 13
forms of real, legitimate replacement, good journalism happening, why don’t you take those seriously as actually stepping up and filling the gap that you say is absent without a plan b. %$* 13
you know, i spent the last year or so going to many conferences about the future of journalism, the crisis of journalism, just last week there was a big report on the reconstruction of american journalism, i’ve read all of michael massing’s pieces in the new york review of books. %$* 134
there are many models. %$* 134
there are many models, and i think—believe i was arguing for a hybrid. %$* 134
i don’t think we throw out what has strong elements, that have worked, for—i want to pick up on john hockenberry’s points, about nbc owning a defense contractor, one of the first centerfolds, the only %$* 134
first centerfold the nation ever did was on the national entertainment state in 1996 where we tracked five octopi. %$* 134

south america. %$* 113
i take it, especially compared to the past. %$* 13
robert blackwill, i think that’s a question for your side. %$* 13
well, i agree that russian policy, contrasted with the soviet period, really has very little interest in either latin america or africa. %$* 107
so, i wouldn’t make the argument that the expression of its power, as you were defining it, is directed at those places. %$* 107
rather, as you said, it is directed into northeast asia, into the middle east, into its own neighborhood, into western europe. %$* 107
all of those places matter a great deal to the united states. %$* 107
ed lucas. %$* 13
i just want to defend mary poppins for a moment. %$* 106
one of the wisest things she said is “a spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down.” and that’s very, very useful in diplomacy. %$* 106
if you want to get things done in the world, it helps to be nice to other countries and get them to do the things that you want and make them feel good about it. %$* 106
and russia is amazingly bad at doing it. %$* 106
russia keeps on setting out very grandiose international organizations-- %$* 106
organization of gas-exporting countries. %$* 106
it’s meant to be kind of gas opec-- %$* 106
didn’t work. %$* 106
shanghai corporation organization-- %$* 106
didn’t work. %$* 106
eurasian economic union-- %$* 106
not working very well. %$* 106
all the countries that russia tries to bring on its side, the closer they get to russia, the less they like what they see and the further away they move from russia, with the result that russia’s big diplomatic initiatives just don’t get anywhere. %$* 106
anyone remember the common european architecture? %$* 106
common european security architecture? %$* 106
that was a great idea of let’s all get around the table and try and sort out european security problems. %$* 106
then people took a closer look and realized that russia doesn’t believe that half the countries in europe are proper countries. %$* 106
they agree with peter hitchens. %$* 106
these are pretend countries that russia has some kind of they can go in there and do whatever they want. %$* 106
and that’s-- %$* 106
nobody’s given them the right to do it-- %$* 106
with the result that all russia’s neighbors are rather scared of russia. %$* 106
whatever russia wants to do, they don’t like it, because they know what russia is like. %$* 106
instead, they’re flocking to try and join nato. and some of them are even being allowed in. %$* 106
i want to remind you that we are on the question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i’m john donvan, your moderator. %$* 13
we have four debaters-- %$* 13
two teams of two-- %$* 13
debating this motion: russia is a marginal power. %$* 13
peter hitchens, would you like to respond to the point just made? %$* 13
well, yes. %$* 108
this news about russia overhauling and overpowering other countries. %$* 108
again, this is-- %$* 108
it’s really crucial to understand that, in 1918, after ludendorff had financed lenin and the bolsheviks to mount a coup d’etat against the then-russian imperial government, which collapsed and surrendered in war. %$* 108
germany imposed on russia frontiers which were regarded by russia as utterly humiliating. %$* 108
so humiliating that even trotsky, one of the bolsheviks, walked out of the talks rather than accept them and was forced to go back in. %$* 108
this was the carthaginian peace. %$* 108
it’s interesting that exactly the same borders imposed on russia in 1918 by the german kaiser have now been imposed on russia again by nato and the european union. %$* 108
they didn’t last then. %$* 108
they won’t last now. %$* 108
there are existential facts about countries. %$* 108
if, as they say-- %$* 108
if somebody took back from the united states the countries which it captured in the war of 1848, which is a good deal more recent than the absorption of ukraine into russia, there would not be very long before there was a move to take them back, and a strong feeling that they did not belong in whatever organization they found themselves in. %$* 108
this is very, very important when you don’t have the pacific ocean, when you don’t have the atlantic ocean, when you don’t have canada, and when you don’t have mexico. %$* 108
just remember that russia is a country. %$* 108
it’s not an idea. %$* 108
and it exists in a hard, cruel world that’s been repeatedly invaded by tatars, swedes, lithuanians, germans, the japanese, the chinese, anybody who happens to be-- %$* 108
peter, let me stop you. %$* 13
let me-- %$* 13
can we please acting-- %$* 108
peter-- %$* 13
as if-- %$* 108
as if-- %$* 108
peter. %$* 13
as if security-- %$* 108
this is the moderator speaking. %$* 13
is as readily available to russia as it is to the united states. %$* 108
peter. %$* 13
land that thought to our motion. %$* 13
why does that, therefore, fight the argument that russia is a marginal power? %$* 13
because the whole-- %$* 108
the whole thrust of these people is that russia should be treated as a marginal power, be pushed to one side, have its national concerns for reasonable security overridden in the belief that it no longer counts and no longer matters. %$* 108
that was in the head of george bush senior. %$* 108
and it was in the head of his secretary of state, jim baker. %$* 108
and that’s what they designed. %$* 108
and that’s what we now have. %$* 108
and it won’t last. %$* 108
and the longer we believe it, the more it will hurt us. %$* 108
all right. %$* 13
ian bremmer. %$* 13
i’ll just say very quickly, which is that i actually think it’s a mistake for the united states to address as if it’s a marginal power because you’re actually just sticking putin’s face in it. %$* 105
i mean, the best thing the united states could do is allow russia to continue to decline and not really pay much attention-- %$* 105
call it less aware of that decline. %$* 105
the fact that the americans have pushed the russians as hard as they have on ukraine, which was critical to them, had been theirs, and which the west is going to win most of, right? %$* 105
the outcome is going to be worse-- %$* 105
after all of this, the outcome is going to be worse for russia. %$* 105
but that’s not good enough for us. %$* 105
we, instead, have to also stick their noses in it. %$* 105
and, as a consequence, the russians are going to get more antsy and uppity. %$* 105
and i don’t blame them. %$* 105
and we’re going to have a few more weeks of headlines around this. %$* 105
but that doesn’t mean that they’re not a marginal power. %$* 105
that just means that we can’t help ourselves, because we’re always right about this stuff, right? %$* 105
i’m sympathetic to what peter is saying. %$* 105
i just don’t think it sways the way you should vote on this thing. %$* 105
and i’m right behind you, sir. %$* 13
i’m sorry. %$* 13
the lady, please. %$* 13
and if you could stand up, so we can find you with the camera. %$* 13
sure. %$* 114
thanks. %$* 13
i’m vickie schnletzer at market news international. %$* 115
last week, we saw the ruble fall to lifetime lows against-- %$* 115
can i ask you to do one thing? %$* 13
because this is a radio broadcast-- %$* 13
lives on for months and months and months. %$* 13
it would help the editor of the radio broadcast if you didn’t say “last week.” %$* 13
okay. %$* 115
because somebody will be listening in may, and will call his broker. %$* 13
okay. %$* 115
recently, we saw the ruble fall against the euro and against the dollar to lifetime ruble lows. %$* 115
the financial market had a very negative reaction to this. %$* 115
today, we saw safe haven treasury demand after the g7's rather strong-- %$* 115
when you say, "today," do you mean these days that we're in now? %$* 13
why don't you just-- %$* 13
just zoom into your question. %$* 13
sure. %$* 115
okay. %$* 13
so we saw safe haven demand after the g7 statement. %$* 115
does the financial market reaction suggest that russia is not a marginal power? %$* 115
that's a really, really great question. %$* 13
i'd like to put that to this side, to the side that's arguing russia is a marginal power. %$* 13
i think that the starting point has got to be, where does russia matter in the global economy? %$* 106
and sadly, as ian's pointed out, it doesn't. %$* 106
it's not a huge-- %$* 106
it does not-- %$* 106
it doesn't have huge attraction to outside investors. %$* 106
people don't like uncertainty. %$* 106
russia is able to cause uncertainty. %$* 106
there's no doubt about it. %$* 106
but it's my contention that it's not enough to be a spoiler. %$* 106
it's not enough to be able to spook the markets. %$* 106
you've got to be able to send-- %$* 106
what would be nice would be to see russia doing something to send the markets up rather than down. %$* 106
i actually have a suspicion-- %$* 106
this is just a kind of mischievous suggestion that possibly putin is financing his adventure in ukraine by shorting the ruble, then doing something stupid, then doing something sensible, letting it go up again. %$* 106
but that's just hypothesis, that's sort of the way that russian decision makers do sometimes approach the financial markets. %$* 106
all right. %$* 13
let's go to robert blackwill on that question. %$* 13
i think that's a terrific question. %$* 107
the russian economy mismanaged, though it is, is the sixth largest economy in the world. %$* 107
if our opponents believe that's marginal, it must mean that they think that only the top five economies-- %$* 107
or maybe they think only the american economy matters. %$* 107
i want to say one other thing, as we-- %$* 107
as we proceed toward the finish line. %$* 107
i think that americans in particular have a penchant to satirize and demonstrate contempt for foreign leaders. %$* 107
and we've seen that. %$* 107
we've taken them into the bathroom during our discussion here. %$* 107
it matters because these are homo sapiens too. %$* 107
and how we talk about them and the degree of arrogance we often-- %$* 107
we americans demonstrate about them is quite separate than what we think of their policies. %$* 107
and so my own judgment is, for what it's worth, is that we should be talking about russian policies and not be ad homonym critics of vladimir putin's personal bathroom habits. %$* 107
but in the case of russia, are those two things-- %$* 13
is not putin central to what the policy is? %$* 13
sure, he is. %$* 107
he's central. %$* 107
and we should do everything we can to affect the decisions that he makes, but we shouldn't make him a cartoon figure. %$* 107
he is not a cartoon figure. %$* 107
he has very great impact on the lives of millions and millions of people outside russia. %$* 107
and, bob, in the context of this debate, why are you making that point now? %$* 13
well, i'm making the point because it's not that power that putin's russia demonstrates is felt around the world and is the best possible example that if millions of people are affected by a nation's policies, external policies, it cannot possibly be a marginal nation. %$* 107
ian bremmer, do you want to respond? %$* 13
well, just the fact that putin has made a satire of himself in his own country. %$* 105
this is not the americans that started this. %$* 105
we don't may attention to international leaders. %$* 105
and we have the last couple weeks on this. %$* 105
but the reality is you want to see the cartoons that are being written about putin, you want to see the local opposition, i mean, that is satire, and it's stinging, and it's painful, and it's unfortunate. %$* 105
but, i mean, the fact is that the amount of the rapacious corruption that has been shown by putin personally, spending a couple billion dollars on his dacha in you know, the-- %$* 105
we don't even talk about all the ways that he likes to show the amphora that he found that were placed a foot and a half under water that were thousands and thousands of years old that ended up coming, you know, from a museum. %$* 105
the russians ended up finding out about that, even in the heavily state- controlled media in russia, and they were embarrassed, and they laughed about it. %$* 105
this isn't the americans doing this. %$* 105
no, and i agree with that. %$* 107
but i think-- %$* 107
the point i was trying to make is that it's one thing for a nation's population to laugh at itself. %$* 107
it's another thing for american arrogance to laugh at others, to caricature others, to make others cartoons. %$* 107
we all will accept much more self-criticisms within our own country than pontificating from abroad. %$* 107
right down front here, please. %$* 13
if you can stand up, a mic is coming from the lefthand side. %$* 13
and we're a little short for time, so i need you to get right to it. %$* 13
do i have to stand up? %$* 19
if i can. %$* 13
in front of everybody? %$* 19
stay there. %$* 13
in front of everybody, well-- %$* 13
anyway, i just-- %$* 19
nobody look. %$* 13
i just quickly-- %$* 19
i just wanted to quickly address a couple things. %$* 19
you know, cartoons are done all the time about presidents, and i don't think that that's important. %$* 19
he still has-- %$* 19
putin still has power. %$* 19
and addressing what the gentleman in the back said about the military, i really feel that-- %$* 19
but, wait, do you have a question? %$* 13
yes. %$* 19
the question is, i believe that-- %$* 19
i'd like-- %$* 19
no, i-- %$* 19
no question ever begins with "i believe." %$* 13
okay. %$* 19
i believe that? %$* 13
maybe. %$* 13
go ahead. %$* 13
i-- %$* 19
do you really believe that if we cut our military, which i think is wrong, that it's going to make a difference in-- %$* 19
it's going to make russia stronger if we cut our military, honestly. %$* 19
and having nuclear power, having nuclear-- %$* 19
the question is, do you really feel that if we cut our military right now, which is on the table with-- %$* 19
i'm going to pass because neither side has raised that point and i want to-- %$* 13
well, it's going to make russia stronger. %$* 19
okay. %$* 13
but thank you. %$* 13
it is going to make russia stronger. %$* 19
can i just-- %$* 116
no. %$* 13
thank you, dan speara. %$* 116
for the group arguing in favor of the motion, could you describe which countries other than the united states and china you would consider a nonmarginal power and why in comparison to russia. %$* 116
very quick list. %$* 13
ed lucas. %$* 13
i'd say most of the countries in the g20.but i would also say that even small countries can play a really important role. %$* 106
i'd say estonia, which is like 1 million people, is a cyber power. %$* 106
it does really interesting stuff on e government and on cyber warfare. %$* 106
and it sends people all over the world. %$* 106
they have people down at the nsa. they have people in maryland. %$* 106
ed, are you-- %$* 13
wait, are you saying that russia is more marginal than estonia? %$* 13
no, i'm just-- %$* 106
no, i was just-- %$* 106
i was just asked for acountry that is clearly not a marginal power. %$* 106
all right, so you say-- %$* 13
you-- %$* 13
these countries earn their prestige. %$* 106
and it's not a binary thing, there's this one dimension. %$* 106
there's all sorts of dimensions in which countries matter. %$* 106
and i think you can find plenty of examples of small countries and also supranational institutions. %$* 106
i'd say the eu mattered. %$* 106
does this side want to respond? %$* 13
if not, that concludes round two. %$* 13
with a shake of the head, that concludes round two of this intelligence squared u.s.debate where our motion is "russia is a marginal power." and remember how you voted before the debate. %$* 13
immediately after closing statements, we're going to have you vote a second time. %$* 13
and that is how we will choose our winner. %$* 13
the team whose numbers have moved the most will be declared our winner. %$* 13
but first, round three, closing statements. %$* 13
two minutes each. %$* 13
the motion is "russia is a marginal power." and here to summarize his position in support of this motion, edward lucas, senior editor at the economist. %$* 13
we've talked a lot so far this evening about hard power, about diplomacy, about military and about economics. %$* 106
we haven't really talked about soft power. %$* 106
and that's the way in which a country projects an idea, a way of doing things that other people want to copy. %$* 106
there's a very interesting test here. %$* 106
go stand outside the american consulate in moscow and count the number of people wanting to immigrate to the united states. %$* 106
it's a long, long line. %$* 106
now go down to the russian consulate in new york and try and find the people wanting to immigrate to russia because it's so great there. %$* 106
that's a very good index of soft power. %$* 106
look at the media. %$* 106
look at russia today. %$* 106
russia today is a wonderful window into the mindset of the people who run russia. %$* 106
they put tens, hundreds of –millions of dollars into-- %$* 106
into russia today as a way of trying to undermine the west and promote the russian-- %$* 106
the russian view of the world. %$* 106
and look at the people who appear on russia today. %$* 106
it's a bunch of cranks and cooks and nut jobs, people who are 9/11 truthers, one of their top presenters in 9/11 truther, people who don't believe that they have-- %$* 106
they interview people who don't believe the moon landings happened, people don't think the holocaust happened, a whole range of eccentric and sometimes very interesting, sometimes unintentionally quite entertaining views. %$* 106
but what they have in common, they're all marginal. %$* 106
thank you, edward lucas. %$* 13
and that is our motion: russia is a marginal power. %$* 13
and here to summarize his position against the motion, peter hitchens, columnist and reporter for the london's mail on sunday. %$* 13
why do the other side so want you to believe the laughable proposition which they're struggling so hard to defend? %$* 108
it's quite simple because of the way russia understands something that we have wholly forgotten. %$* 108
in 1648, the nations of europe looked at their-- %$* 108
looked at their continent. %$* 108
and they saw that it looked pretty much like a hieronymus bosch painting-- %$* 108
nothing but desolation, ruins, and corpses stretching for hundreds of miles in every direction. %$* 108
the population had actually fallen. %$* 108
the reason? %$* 108
because they decided that it would be a really, really clever idea to intervene in other people’s countries, because they didn’t like the way they were governed. %$* 108
and they resolved that they would not do that anymore. %$* 108
and until a few years ago, when the disgraceful person who became prime minister of my country, tony blair, became prominent, this was a generally accepted view in all countries that we wouldn’t do this anymore. %$* 108
we wouldn’t shove our noses into other people’s countries just because we didn’t like the way they were run, because that led to misery, murder, and death. %$* 108
and russia stands actually, for principles of 1648, it still continues to insist that countries should be left to mind their own business. %$* 108
stay out of ours; we’ll stay out of yours. %$* 108
that-- %$* 108
no wait a minute. %$* 108
i didn’t heckle you. %$* 108
don’t you heckle me. %$* 108
this is a straightforward, simple question. %$* 108
the reason they want to marginalize russia is because they have forgotten one of the most important lessons ever learned by civilization. %$* 108
they want you to forget it, too. %$* 108
we’ve seen in syria the results of this folly. %$* 108
we’ve seen them in libya. %$* 108
and we see them in iraq. %$* 108
it really is time it stop. %$* 108
the attack on russia is actually attack on something else entirely. %$* 108
that’s why you should oppose this very foolish, very wrong- headed, and frankly rather hopeless motion. %$* 108
thank you, peter hitchens. %$* 13
and to restate this motion, it is “russia is a marginal power.” and here to summarize his position in support of the motion, ian bremmer, founder and president of eurasia group. %$* 13
if the motion were, “is russia-- %$* 105
” or “russia is a marginal power in the 17th century,”-- %$* 105
i would vote with peter’s side because no one else has addressed that issue but him. %$* 105
that is not what we are talking about tonight. %$* 105
we’re talking about whether or not russia is today. %$* 105
now, look. %$* 105
no one really has defined power well, either. %$* 105
so, let me try to do it. %$* 105
power is the ability to get other actors to do things they otherwise would not. %$* 105
and there’s two ways to do it. %$* 105
you can do it coercively, or you do it-- %$* 105
you can do it cooperatively. %$* 105
there are also many, many ways that you can get it done-- %$* 105
many axes, right? %$* 105
you can get it done militarily, economically, right? %$* 105
socially, demographically, culturally. %$* 105
if we were only talking about military, and particularly nuclear weapons, russia would probably have major power status and superpower status. %$* 105
but on every other indicator, they wouldn’t. %$* 105
and if i add them all up, what other countries deserve that when you put all the indicators together? %$* 105
japan, germany, the united states, china. %$* 105
i mean, frankly-- %$* 105
i know peter is going to hate this-- %$* 105
even the u.k.does better than the russians do. %$* 105
that’s appalling how much the russians have fallen-- %$* 105
over the last 20 years. %$* 105
and even on the military side, the united states still spends more than the next 10 countries, pretty much, combined, which is probably too much. %$* 105
and it probably needs to be cut back a bit. %$* 105
and sure, at the margins will be some things that the united states can’t do that other countries, as a consequence, can make some hay, yes. %$* 105
but who’s going to make that hay? %$* 105
overwhelmingly, it’s going to be the chinese-- %$* 105
primarily in asia and other places. %$* 105
and yet, still, we’re the only one with a blue-water global navy. %$* 105
and so, if you want to get energy out of the middle east, even though we won’t need it anymore, everyone else will have to turn to the united states. %$* 105
so no, i’m not really concerned about that. %$* 105
if the only thing you want to vote on is, “can they blow us up from a nuclear perspective? %$* 105
”, please vote with them. %$* 105
if anything else matters to you, please vote with us. %$* 105
thank you very much. %$* 105
thank you, ian bremmer. %$* 13
the motion, “russia is a marginal power.” and here to summarize his position against the motion, robert blackwill, former deputy national security adviser for strategic planning under president george w. bush. %$* 13
i agree with ian that it would be wrong to define russia and its influence on the world solely through military means or nuclear weapons. %$* 107
i couldn’t agree more. %$* 107
so, let’s talk about diplomacy. %$* 107
and, in two regards. %$* 107
first, iran. %$* 107
i think we all know what a danger iran and its nuclear weapons program poses for israel, for the united states, indeed, for the international system. %$* 107
the five members of the security council are negotiating with iran, including russia, to seek to have a peaceful solution to that. %$* 107
that is only possible with russian agreement. %$* 107
and if we don’t have a peaceful solution, the american president will be confronted with a terrible binary choice: either attack iran with devastating consequences, or allow iran to acquire a nuclear weapon with devastating consequences. %$* 107
and it is russia that will decide whether we can have a peaceful solution to the iranian nuclear program. %$* 107
and then, syria. %$* 107
we’ve had some fun tonight, and we should in this kind of debate. %$* 107
but i want to end with deep seriousness. %$* 107
russia is preventing sanctions against syria, which would have some hope of reducing the syrian regime’s brutal attack on its own people. %$* 107
in that context, the save the children fund this week argues that at least 1.2 million syrian children have fled to neighboring countries. %$* 107
4.3 million syrian children need humanitarian assistance. %$* 107
and more than 10,000 syrian children have died in that civil war in a-- %$* 107
in a situation in which russia supports the assad regime. %$* 107
robert blackwill, i’m sorry. %$* 13
your time is up. %$* 13
those children believe russia is a marginal country? %$* 107
thank you, robert blackwill. %$* 13
and that concludes our closing statements. %$* 13
and now, it’s time to learn which side you feel has argued the best. %$* 13
we’re going to ask you again to go to the keypads at your seat and vote a second time on this motion, “russia is a marginal power.” if you agree with this argue-- %$* 13
with this motion after hearing the arguments, push number one. %$* 13
if you disagree, push number two. %$* 13
and if you became, or remain, undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and we’ll lock it out in a couple of seconds. %$* 13
and we’ll have the results in about a minute and a half. %$* 13
okay, while we’re doing that, i just want to take a couple of-- %$* 13
i want to make a couple of very short announcements. %$* 13
first of all-- %$* 13
first of all, i want to point out that a number of the debaters on the stage, including ian bremmer, were about 30 to 48 hours ago on the other side of the world. %$* 13
and they got off planes and flew over here. %$* 13
and they must have been exhausted, but they brought great strength and energy-- %$* 13
and also, i think, decency and equality of respect to these debates that we aspire to. %$* 13
you did a great job, all of you. %$* 13
and i want to thank you for all of that. %$* 13
i’ll remind you that we would love to have you tweet about this debate. %$* 13
the twitter handle is @iq2us, and the hashtag is #russiadebate. %$* 13
our next debate is at columbia university’s miller theater in partnership with the richmond center. %$* 13
the motion is, “more clicks, fewer bricks: the lecture hall is obsolete.” that’s the question that we’re asking. %$* 13
and it’s basically do massive open online course and inexpensive online degree programs spell the end of the traditional campus-based college experience? %$* 13

and the debate will be on millennials. %$* 13

here is how it went. %$* 13
the motion, “russia is a marginal power.” before the debate, 25 percent of you agreed with motion; 43 percent were against; 32 percent were undecided. %$* 13
so, those are the first results. %$* 13
remember, you voted a second time. %$* 13
the winner is the team whose numbers have changed the most in percentage-point terms. %$* 13
here is the second vote on “russia is a marginal power.” the team arguing for the motion-- %$* 13
their second vote is 35 percent-- %$* 13
from 25 to 35 percent. %$* 13
that’s a 10 percent gain; 10 percent is the number to beat. %$* 13
the team, now, arguing against the motion, their first vote was 43 percent. %$* 13
their second vote was 58 percent. %$* 13
they pulled over 15 percentage points. %$* 13
the team arguing against the motion that russia is a marginal power has won. %$* 13

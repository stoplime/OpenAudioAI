critics of the war argue that prevailing in afghanistan cannot be done. %$* 1
and even if it could be done, it shouldn’t be done. %$* 1
it cannot be done, because the karzai government is hopelessly corrupt, inept and unpopular. %$* 1
because afghanistan is a tribal culture that has never accepted strong centralized authority. %$* 1
because after 9 years of combat there has been essentially zero progress in handing responsibility for security to the afghanis. %$* 1
and it shouldn’t be done because we have falsely conflated the taliban with al qaeda. %$* 1
the taliban is local: it wants to impose its extreme version of islam on the territory it is fighting to control in afghanistan. %$* 1
in contrast, al qaeda is global. %$* 1
it is largely based in pakistan, with outposts in yemen and somalia and is specifically organized to project terror globally and is a clear threat to us national interests. %$* 1
prevailing in afghanistan will not diminish al qaeda. %$* 1
the counter argument is that it should be done because the taliban and al qaeda are ideological soul mates. %$* 1
the taliban sponsored al qaeda before and will do it again. %$* 1
the success of their insurgency will be a humanitarian disaster, a stinging defeat for the us and our allies, and will provide no end of encouragement to our enemies. %$* 1
and it can be done because our efforts in afghanistan to defeat that insurgency are now headed by general petraeus. %$* 1
he accomplished a much harder mission in iraq where he literally wrote the book on counter insurgency operations. %$* 1
he is among the most creative and thoughtful military leaders we have, or have ever had. %$* 1
we are succeeding in making life miserable indeed for the taliban, thus setting up the conditions for a negotiated settlement. %$* 1
we have been at this, with full troop deployment and under petraeus’ leadership for a few months. %$* 1
we can hardly declare victory, but it is way too early to declare defeat. %$* 1
which is the better argument? %$* 1
tonight’s expert panelists will be trying to persuade you to vote their way; and it is now my privilege to hand the evening over to our moderator, john donvan. %$* 1
thank you. %$* 13
and may i invite one more round of applause for robert rosencranz, please. %$* 13
or false: afghanistan is a lost cause. %$* 13
that's what we are here to debate. %$* 13
welcome, everyone. %$* 13
i'm john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
and on behalf of intelligence squared u.s, welcome to the skirball center for the performing arts at new york university and on npr stations across the nation. %$* 13
as we argue this motion, afghanistan is a lost cause. %$* 13
we have two teams of debaters, two against two. %$* 13
they include a journalist who has spent time among the taliban and come back to tell the tale, a state department official who walked away from his job in afghanistan in frustration, a journalist who sat down and talked with osama bin laden in the '90s, a good indicator of what was coming, and a military historian. %$* 13
now, this is a debate. %$* 13
it's a contest of idea, a verbal joust. %$* 13
and in this debate, you, our audience, serve as the judges. %$* 13
we would like you now to go to the key pads on your seats and register your opinion on this motion as you come in before hearing these arguments. %$* 13
the motion again, afghanistan is a lost cause. %$* 13
if you agree with this motion, press number one. %$* 13
if you disagree, press number two. %$* 13
and if you are undecided, press number three. %$* 13
if you feel that you have pressed a key in error, just correct it, and the system will lock in your last answer. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
i'm assuming everybody's locked in. %$* 13
so let's move forward. %$* 13
by the time this debate has ended, you will have been asked to vote twice, once before and once again at the end of the debate. %$* 13
and the team that has changed the most minds will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so onto round one, opening statements by each side in turn. %$* 13
they will be seven minutes each. %$* 13
and i'd like to begin by introducing our first speaker for the motion, matthew hoh. %$* 13
matthew hoh, in addition to serving in iraq as a marine captain, went on to serve in afghanistan for the state department. %$* 13
he resigned his position there in 2009, writing a letter to his superiors in which he said, "i have lost understanding of and confidence in the strategic purposes of the u.s.presence in afghanistan." when he turned his back, great efforts were made by members of the obama administration to get you to stay, matthew. %$* 13
you didn't. %$* 13
and i want to know, have you ever had any second thoughts about that decision. %$* 13
you know, john, i do. %$* 88
at times, i do. %$* 88
i just had lunch the other day with a friend of mine who is back on r & r from state doing a job like i used to do in eastern afghanistan. %$* 88
and you do have pangs of guilt, but they're pangs, and they go away when you realize that there's a larger issue here in terms of what's of benefit to u.s. national interest. %$* 88
which is what you’re about to argue. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, mr. %$* 13
matthew hoh. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 88
it's an honor to be here tonight, particularly on this stage with peter and max, who are all acknowledged experts in this field. %$* 88
also a little daunting. %$* 88
i've done a lot of panels. %$* 88
i've never done a debate with clocks and buzzers and voting. %$* 88
so cut me some slack. %$* 88
i'm also local. %$* 88
i'm from jersey, if that helps in the voting process as well. %$* 88
but i just want to say also, too, if there're any marines in the room, happy birthday marines. %$* 88
today is the 235th birthday of the marine corps. %$* 88
and it's appropriate to be having this discussion tonight because, you know, so far this year in afghanistan, or so far this month in afghanistan, the first ten days in november, we've seen 16 service members killed, many of them marines. %$* 88
so it's important for us to have a discussion on a day like this because it's those service members and their families who are bearing the direct costs of this conflict. %$* 88
you're going to hear tonight a lot of nuanced and complex arguments between us. %$* 88
and that's about right because the united states is entangled in a very complicated situation. %$* 88
to use the term civil war is not incorrect. %$* 88
you're going to hear us disagree on the relationship between the taliban and al-qaeda. %$* 88
i found, in my experience, in both eastern and southern afghanistan, that the vast, vast majority of the taliban that are fighting our troops every day are not wedded to an ideology that al-qaeda embraces, that they are fighting occupation, and they are not fighting for some type of transnational jihad. %$* 88
you will see us disagree over the similarities between the iraq and afghan surge. %$* 88
again, i was in both. %$* 88
i was fully invested in the iraq surge in 2006 in anbar province, i was one of the first civilian surge members last year into afghanistan. %$* 88
and there are similarities between the iraq surge and the afghan surge. %$* 88
but those similarities are more in terms of how the us is doing policy and how we didn't do things right to begin with in iraq and now all those policies we're doing wrong in afghanistan. %$* 88
and i look forward to a discussion. %$* 88
i know nir's got a lot of comments on this, and i look forward to having this talk with peter and max. %$* 88
you're also going to hear a lot of facts, figures and statistics tonight. %$* 88
and i want you to keep in mind the big picture. %$* 88
i want you to ask, so what? %$* 88
after every fact or figure or statistic you hear. %$* 88
hopefully when peter and max say it and not when nir and i say it, because it's just a case of don't lose sight or track of the forest because of the trees. %$* 88
and so keep in mind, bear in mind some basic aspects of the war in afghanistan. %$* 88
the cost. %$* 88
last year we spent-- %$* 88
the united states spent $104 billion in afghanistan. %$* 88
this year, we are projected to spend $119 billion in afghanistan. %$* 88
afghanistan's gdp is $14 billion. %$* 88
we are spending seven times as much in that country as it's worth. %$* 88
as the dutch, the canadian, probably the french and italians move out of afghanistan, of course, our costs will go up. %$* 88
and so when you hear the administration say, we're looking at keeping this policy in place till 2014, that's a half trillion price tag plus about 2400 dead american and coalition soldiers as well as thousands more afghans at this pace. %$* 88
keep in mind that since 2005, we have seen a fivefold increase in u.s.and nato troops in afghanistan. %$* 88
literally every year since 2005, we have doubled the foreign troop presence in afghanistan. %$* 88
and what's occurred from that is that only every year a commensurate rise in violence, a commensurate rise in support for the taliban and a decrease in support for the karzai government. %$* 88
you see this with a number of taliban. %$* 88
in 2005, we estimated there are 2000 active duty fighters in afghanistan. %$* 88
now we're estimating there are 35 to 40,000 active duty taliban fighters in afghanistan. %$* 88
so not only is the policy expensive, failing, it's also counterproductive because it's causing people to join the insurgency. %$* 88
it's exasperating the conflict, and it's making the region less stable. %$* 88
and that includes pakistan. %$* 88
additionally, keep in mind the nature of al-qaeda. %$* 88
keep in mind it is only 50 to a hundred members of al-qaeda in afghanistan, according to our cia. and contrast that with the 1,000-- %$* 88
the 2,000 members of al-qaeda that our state department said are still in iraq in their report last august on terrorism. %$* 88
contrast that with the fact that the german police say there are 45 members of al-qaeda in hamburg, germany. %$* 88
hamburg being the place that probably had as much to do with the planning, if not more, for the 9/11 attacks than afghanistan. %$* 88
and before i forget to put a plug in for a great article on the nature of al-qaeda on khalid sheikh mohammed and on 9/11, please read the “new yorker” article from september by terry mcdermott. %$* 88
really shows how al-qaeda is this grouping of individuals. %$* 88
it's a collection of individuals. %$* 88
it's not a formal military organization that we can defeat with conventional forces. %$* 88
and think about it. %$* 88
look back at the last 10 years of their attacks. %$* 88
their most recent attack, a lady who took two parcel bombs and fedexed them from yemen. %$* 88
look at the attacks of the last three years in this country in the sense that they're done by individuals, small cells, it's a decentralized organization that will not be affected by the presence of brigade combat teams occupying southern afghanistan. %$* 88
so nine years ago 19 men hijacked four airplanes. %$* 88
we're now in afghanistan 109 months later with 100,000 troops spending over $100 billion a year. %$* 88
nir and i are not advocating for us to cut and run or abandon afghanistan but we are advocating for a policy that is not destabilizing, not counterproductive, and not effective against afghanistan. %$* 88
we're arguing for something that will-- %$* 88
or against al-qaeda, we're actually arguing for something that will affect al-qaeda and stabilize the region. %$* 88
thank you. %$* 88
thank you, matthew hoh. %$* 13
our motion is "afghanistan is a lost cause." and now to speak first against the motion, max boot, who is a military historian. %$* 13
he's on the council of foreign relations. %$* 13
interesting to me since i actually covered afghanistan when the soviets were occupying, i found it interesting that you were born in moscow before your parents flew out to l.a. but the soviet invasion and occupation, was that always a lost cause? %$* 13
it was really night and day, john. %$* 89
i mean, i've actually been reading about the soviet war in the 1980s for a book that i'm now writing on the history of guerilla warfare, and it is so totally different from what we're doing, i mean, the soviets really fought in the scorched earth manner, they killed over a million afghans, they turned over five million into refugees, they destroyed the countryside, they threw landmines around indiscriminately-- %$* 89
different story this time. %$* 13
completely different from what-- %$* 89
the kind of tactics that we're employing today. %$* 89
different story this time, and let's hear it. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, max boot. %$* 13
thank you very much, john. %$* 89
it's a pleasure to be here. %$* 89
and i'd like to extend my sympathies to our distinguished opponents on the other side. %$* 89
i know they will make a valiant attempt as you've already heard matt do, but i'm very sorry to say they have an impossible burden of proof today. %$* 89
they have to convince you that it's impossible for america and our allies to prevail in afghanistan, that there is no way we can achieve our objective, which isn't to create paradise on earth, but merely an afghanistan that is free of terrorist safe havens and that can secure and govern itself. %$* 89
for our part, we don't have to convince you that success is assured; only that it's possible. %$* 89
for anyone familiar with military history, that ought to be a no-brainer. %$* 89
numerous countries have won wars after overcoming obstacles far more severe than those we face today. %$* 89
think of britain standing alone against the nazis in 1940.think of u.s.forces almost being pushed off the green peninsula in the summer of 1950, or more recently, think of iraq in 2006.now, you will hear, as you've already heard from matt, our opponents say that afghanistan isn't iraq. %$* 89
and they're right. %$* 89
iraq was much worse. %$* 89
in 2006 iraq was in the throes of a full-blown civil war. %$* 89
that year 34,000 civilians died, shi’a and sunni terrorists had high levels of support in their sectarian communities, prime minister maliki’s government was implicated in death squad activity, and back home the democrats won majorities in congress on an antiwar platform. %$* 89
even many supporters of the war effort thought we were on the brink of defeat. %$* 89
for example, on august 9th of 2006, i wrote in the l.a.times, "bush needs to do something radical to shake up a deteriorating status quo if we are to have any hope of averting the worst american military defeat since vietnam.”luckily president bush did do something radical. %$* 89
he ordered a surge which turned around a war effort which many had written off as hopeless. %$* 89
today another surge is just starting, and it actually has better prospects of success because the situation in afghanistan is objectively much better than it was in iraq. %$* 89
yes, civilian casualties are up, but they're still 1/16th as high as they were in iraq. %$* 89
yes, violence has spread, but 63 percent of attacks still happen in just three provinces. %$* 89
yes, there is the stress among ethnic groups. %$* 89
we are not facing a civil war. %$* 89
this is an intra-pashtun conflict. %$* 89
yes, hamid karzai is a problematic leader, but at least he is not running death squads and he has cooperated on important initiatives such as the village security program. %$* 89
and, yes, public opinion has turned against the war, but president obama will receive a lot more support from republicans than president bush received from democrats. %$* 89
i am also relatively optimistic about afghanistan because the armed forces have gotten much better at counterinsurgency. %$* 89
the coin strategy that general petraeus is implementing today draws not only on the war in iraq, but also in conflicts as diverse as columbia, el salvador, malaya, and the philippines. %$* 89
he is not only focusing on kinetic operations, killing the enemy, but also on improving governance, intelligence collection, the handling of detainees, information operations and much more. %$* 89
it’s a huge difference from the sleepy days of 2008 when there were only 32,000 u.s.troops in the country and they were stuck in a holding pattern. %$* 89
now we have a hundred thousands troops there. %$* 89
the last of the surge forces only arrived in september but already they’re making a difference. %$* 89
this summer i visited nawa in helmand province. %$* 89
before the marines got there in 2009, it was a virtual ghost town dominated by the taliban. %$* 89
today, it’s safe enough to walk around without body armor. %$* 89
stores and schools have reopened, electrical lines are going up. %$* 89
agricultural canals are being cleared. %$* 89
this is tangible progress. %$* 89
similar operations are now in full-swing around kandahar, the heartland of the taliban. %$* 89
the new york times, hardly a pro-war organ, reported on october 20, “american and afghan forces have been routing the taliban in much of kandahar province in recent weeks forcing many hardened fighters to flee strongholds they have held for years.” we are also seeing stepped-up operations to capture or kill taliban and haqqani leaders. %$* 89
in the past 90 days, special operations forces have carried out more than 1,500 operations resulting in the death or capture of almost 3,800 insurgents. %$* 89
air strikes have more than doubled over the past year and yet according to the u.n., civilian deaths from nato bombings were down 64 percent in the first half of the year. %$* 89
that’s a tribute to the very careful rules of engagement promulgated by general mcchrystal and general petraeus something that distinguishes us greatly from the way the red army or others have fought in afghanistan. %$* 89
to win over the population, coalition forces are also working to improve governance and cut corruption. %$* 89
a lot of the corruption in afghanistan has been fueled by our own money. %$* 89
in the years when we have few troops there, we contracted out security to warlords who abused the people and drove them into the arms of the taliban. %$* 89
now that is changing. %$* 89
we are less reliant on warlords and general petraeus is striving to ensure that our spending doesn’t fuel corruption. %$* 89
a lot of the focus today is on avoiding bottlenecks in kabul by working in the provinces where the troops are assisted by a civilian surge with the number of civilian u.s.government employees there having gone up three times in the past year, three fold. %$* 89
perhaps the most important line of operations is the training of afghan security forces, the ansf.that’s our ticket out of afghanistan. %$* 89
as they stand up, we can draw down responsibly as we’ve done in iraq. %$* 89
we don’t need to stay until afghanistan is as peaceful as switzerland, only until it can be secured by its own troops. %$* 89
and how is the ansf training going? %$* 89
well let me quote you again from the new york times on october 12. %$* 89
which said that “long a lagging priority, the plan to produce many more trained afghan troops is moving this fall at a rapid pace. %$* 89
ansf numbers have jumped from 137,000 in 2008 to 258,000 today and their quality is higher because of smaller class sizes and more intensive mentoring. %$* 89
salaries are up, desertion rates are down.” now i don’t want to over-estimate the progress that has occurred or under-estimate the problems that remain. %$* 89
there is no doubt that we face a long, hard fight. %$* 89
but the biggest thing we have on our side is public opinion. %$* 89
my colleague peter bergen will tell you more about this. %$* 89
but the fact is the afghans have experienced taliban rule and they didn’t like it. %$* 89
fewer than 10 percent say they want a return to the taliban. %$* 89
more than 60 percent support the nato troop presence. %$* 89
again, john, this is not the soviet invasion of afghanistan. %$* 89
we have the people on our side. %$* 89
is afghanistan a lost cause? %$* 89
president obama doesn’t think so. %$* 89
otherwise he wouldn’t have sent more than 50,000 additional troops there. %$* 89
general petraeus doesn’t think so. %$* 89
otherwise he wouldn’t have accepted a command that could tarnish his sterling legacy. %$* 89
we don’t think so either. %$* 89
i look forward to hearing from our opponents to see how they can possibly prove otherwise. %$* 89
thank you. %$* 89
thank you. %$* 13
next please. %$* 13
this is a debate from intelligence squared u.s.i’m jon donvan of abc news. %$* 13
we have two teams of two each arguing it out over this motion: “afghanistan is a lost cause.” we have heard opening statements from the first two debaters and now on to the third. %$* 13
nir rosen is a journalist who risked an awful lot by crossing over for several weeks or months to report on the taliban side of things and he survived and came back to tell the tale in a new book he’s just come out with called “aftermath.” nir, i read in the book that before you went, you memorized some phrases in pashto to get around. %$* 13
what was the single most important phrase that you learned and took with you? %$* 13
manoo whizhna means don’t kill me. %$* 90
don’t kill me. %$* 13
and apparently they listened. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, nir rosen. %$* 13
max said that our goal in afghanistan is to make sure it’s a terrorist safe haven-free country. %$* 90
in a sense, we did that. %$* 90
in 2001 and 2002, we got rid of al-qaeda in afghanistan. %$* 90
so i'm not sure why we're still there. %$* 90
he also said that iraq was worse than afghanistan during the civil war. %$* 90
that's true. %$* 90
and iraq is still worse than afghanistan today. %$* 90
so where is our success in iraq? %$* 90
you have more civilians being killed in iraq today than you do in afghanistan today. %$* 90
this is after the surge. %$* 90
now, people like to forget about iraq, and the media has certainly forgotten about it. %$* 90
but i think we can't understand what's happening in afghanistan and what the americans think they're doing in afghanistan without understanding what really happened in iraq. %$* 90
the surge is this narrative that things were going badly. %$* 90
you have the 2006 samarra shrine incident where the shrine was blown up, the civil war broke out. %$* 90
and then this genius general called david petraeus came up with a new way of fighting a war, and that solved the problem. %$* 90
none of that is really true. %$* 90
robert also mentioned that petraeus wrote the counterinsurgency manual. %$* 90
that's not really true, either. %$* 90
he signed his name at the bottom of it, but he actually had hundreds of other people involved in the process and probably corrected a few spelling mistakes. %$* 90
but you have all kind of academics and officers involved in that process. %$* 90
now, the civil war in iraq, the people that won the civil war weren't the american forces. %$* 90
it was black and decker. %$* 90
what do i mean by that, whenever you find a corpse in iraq that was beheaded, you knew it was killed by a sunni militiaman. %$* 90
if you find the corpse with black and decker power drill marks in it, shia militiamen killed it. %$* 90
and what defeated the sunni insurgency in iraq was not the american surge. %$* 90
it was shia militiamen in collaboration with the iraqi police and the iraqi army who brutally crushed the sunni population,not just with power drills, but also with executions and rape with full knowledge of the americans. %$* 90
there was a shia colonel in west baghdad called sabah an army criminal who used to kidnap men, sunni men, and then force their wives to have sex with them in order to release these men. %$* 90
beginning in 2006, this was about six months before petraeus came into iraq, i began to meet iraqi resistance leaders in baghdad, in syria, in jordan. %$* 90
and suddenly, they were saying, “we lost, we lost.” and why did they lose? %$* 90
because the shia had depopulated sunni areas brutally, a sort of brutality that the americans could never use. %$* 90
so we were killing innocent civilians but not in these rates. %$* 90
at the same time, you had a total separation of sunni and shia civilians thanks to the civil war. %$* 90
one side won the civil war, the shias, one side lost, the sunnis. %$* 90
and sunni neighborhoods in baghdad became, very often, virtual ghost towns. %$* 90
this is all six months before the surge started. %$* 90
and i was just in iraq about a month ago. %$* 90
i was at diyala province, where in july 2007, seven months after the surge began, hundreds of villages were destroyed. %$* 90
al-qaeda guys would come in there and total the village, blow up all the houses, slaughter the men, likewise shia militiamen were doing the same thing to sunni villages. %$* 90
seven months after the surge, violence was still peaking. %$* 90
what changed, apart from the sunni realization that they lost was the shia cease fire. %$* 90
the shia militiamen, the mahdi army declared a ceasefire, and violence dropped significantly after that. %$* 90
at the same time, you had a government that actually had some legitimacy because they would, a year later, go after the shia militiamen, totally destroying them as well. %$* 90
now, none of the factors that helped reduce violence in iraq to the terrible levels where they are today, still worse than afghanistan, none of these factors even exist in afghanistan. %$* 90
first of all, the sunnis in iraq who dominated the insurgency, were 20 percent of the population. %$* 90
and they were destroyed and brutalized and turned into refugees in syria and jordan and elsewhere. %$* 90
the insurgency is afghanistan is dominated by pashtuns, 38 to 40 percent of the population, the largest group in afghanistan. %$* 90
and they are not being brutalized. %$* 90
the taliban is not a pashtun movement, but it's dominated by pashtuns. %$* 90
and they feel like they're on the rise. %$* 90
they have the momentum. %$* 90
they are spreading not only in pashtun areas, but even in the north, among non-pastuns, among tajiks and turkmen and uzbeks, they’re reactivating old networks from the taliban era. %$* 90
they feel like they’re doing quite well. %$* 90
likewise, baghdad was the prize in the civil war in iraq. %$* 90
it was the dense, urban areas. %$* 90
the americans could take each neighborhood in baghdad and build immense walls around them, and really control the population. %$* 90
in afghanistan it’s a rural insurgency. %$* 90
we might be focusing on the cities kandahar, kabul, lashkar gah-- %$* 90
the russians did the same thing. %$* 90
most of the population of afghanistan is in the villages. %$* 90
the taliban are in the villages, just like the mujahideen in the '80s were in the villages. %$* 90
we're making the same mistakes that the russians were making, trying to control the cities and thinking that somehow we'll defeat the mujahideen and the taliban who are in the rural areas. %$* 90
now, in iraq, we had a government that somehow had some legitimacy. %$* 90
they represented the majority of the people. %$* 90
they crushed the shia militias. %$* 90
in afghanistan-- %$* 90
a key element in american counterinsurgency thinking is that you have to build the capacity of the government so it can spread its power and control the population. %$* 90
but in afghanistan, the government is the problem. %$* 90
it's predatory, it's corrupt. %$* 90
it's lacking any credibility. %$* 90
it’s the best recruiter for the taliban. %$* 90
so the last thing we want to do is ally ourselves and tie ourselves to this afghan government which is hated by most of the population. %$* 90
the police, when they're not doing drugs, the afghan police are stealing from stores, are demanding taxes at checkpoints. %$* 90
the afghan army, i was with the americans in the surge of 2009.the afghan army didn't show up. %$* 90
they're afghan police. %$* 90
this time in kandahar, the afghan army didn't show up again. %$* 90
we've spent billions on the afghan army. %$* 90
we, as taxpayers should be upset about this. %$* 90
and who's fighting on our side in kandahar today? %$* 90
it's not the afghan army. %$* 90
it is colonel raziq from the border police, a brutal warlord who brutalized the population of kandahar a few years ago and turned many people, such as the noorzai clan, against the u.s. and joined the taliban. %$* 90
we've gone back to the same guy, colonel raziq, not the army, recruited a warlord. %$* 90
where is the afghan army? %$* 90
they just decided not to show up. %$* 90
we don't know what happened to our billions of dollars. %$* 90
so you don't have a government with any legitimacy or any prospect of legitimacy. %$* 90
you don't have any sign that you're defeating the insurgency or that you're punishing the population. %$* 90
in fact, there's only one counterinsurgency campaign that's ever worked in history. %$* 90
that was the british in malaya. %$* 90
and why did that work? %$* 90
the british basically took half a million ethnic chinese, put them in concentration camps and took them away from their homes. %$* 90
so, sure, we can do that in afghanistan. %$* 90
we could defeat the taliban. %$* 90
we could massively depopulate pashtun areas and be genocidal about it. %$* 90
short of that, there's just no evidence to date that we can do anything better. %$* 90
nine years into this, every year, things have gotten worse and worse. %$* 90
this year is the worst year so far. %$* 90
next year is guaranteed to be worse. %$* 90
the violence is spreading. %$* 90
taliban control about 80 percent of the country right now. %$* 90
we are hated. %$* 90
in my travels, i was shocked-- %$* 90
i was in afghanistan last january and february. %$* 90
and i was shocked to see that school teachers, local government officials, bus drivers were all complaining to me about the americans and their night raids and their operations killing civilians. %$* 90
i don't think the american people know the extent to which the afghans resent their presence or feel humiliated by it. %$* 90
all right. %$* 90
thanks. %$* 90
nir rosen, your time is up. %$* 13
all right. %$* 90
thanks. %$* 90
thank you. %$* 13
afghanistan is a lost cause is our motion. %$* 13
and now to speak against the motion, the last speaker in our opening statements, peter bergen is a journalist who is well-known for the fact that in the mid '90s, he went out to afghanistan and sat down with a gentleman named osama bin laden, one of the very few americans ever to have met and talked with him. %$* 13
he wrote a book called “the osama bin laden i know.” peter, what do you know what the rest of us don't? %$* 13
no sense of humor. %$* 91
he's not a barrel of laughs. %$* 91
he's not a funny guy. %$* 91
peter bergen. %$* 13
first i want to salute the service of matthew hoh both in afghanistan and iraq. %$* 91
and i want to salute nir rosen's brave and enterprising reporting. %$* 91
it's very good to be on this stage with them and my colleague max. %$* 91
and let's remind-- %$* 91
max at the beginning said what this motion was about. %$* 91
this motion is not about afghanistan is kind of not going well. %$* 91
this motion is not about we're kind of not doing so well. %$* 91
we're sort of losing. %$* 91
this is-- %$* 91
the motion is about afghanistan is a lost cause. %$* 91
now, that is a pretty high bar that they have to prove. %$* 91
and so far we've heard a lot about iraq, not much about afghanistan, and some pretty easy to disprove assertions that they've made when they talked about afghanistan. %$* 91
and some things that they didn't even talk about, i'm surprised. %$* 91
you know, the graveyard of empires cliche, for instance. %$* 91
they didn't bring this up. %$* 91
well, turns out that many empires have gone into afghanistan and done pretty well. %$* 91
the only empire that didn't do well there was the soviets for the very good reason that they, as my colleague max point out, they killed a million afghans, made 5 million of them homeless. %$* 91
a successful counterinsurgency operation is exactly what we're doing and what the soviets did not do. %$* 91
rather, the small numbers of afghan civilians are dying in this war, too many to be sure. %$* 91
but we're talking, instead of millions, as happened under the soviets, hundreds. %$* 91
and as max pointed out, the numbers are dropping, particularly because of our rules of engagement. %$* 91
we heard from nir that afghanistan is a very violent place. %$* 91
well, actually, you're more likely to be murdered in my hometown of washington, d.c.than you are to be killed in the war in afghanistan right now. %$* 91
last year, about 3,000 afghan civilians were killed in the war, population of 30 million. %$* 91
but you're more likely to be murdered in the united states in 1991 just generally than you are to be killed in the war in afghanistan right now. %$* 91
it is simply not that violent. %$* 91
in fact, my wife is sitting here. %$* 91
we met in afghanistan. %$* 91
you can actually have quite a good time in kabul. %$* 91
it's a relatively peaceful place. %$* 91
there are restaurants, there are bars. %$* 91
you can have a regular social life, which, by the way, you could never have in baghdad. %$* 91
and if you look at the murder rates in countries like mexico, venezuela, columbia, and russia, they're much, much higher than the death rate from the war in afghanistan. %$* 91
we're not saying that washington, d.c.is a lost cause. %$* 91
maybe some people might say that. %$* 91
but we're not saying that russia is a lost cause, we're not saying that columbia is a lost cause, we're not saying that mexico is a lost cause, we're not saying venezuela is a lost cause, yet our opponents are suggesting it's a lost cause. %$* 91
and this is ridiculous. %$* 91
another thing we've heard, of course, if the karzai government is corrupt, and inefficient, and incompetent, sure, no doubt, but let's look at the neighborhood. %$* 91
to his west he has iran with ahmadinejad, who's a holocaust denier. %$* 91
we don't need to say much more about him. %$* 91
to his north he has karimov, of uzbekistan, who boils people alive as a sort of forensic technique. %$* 91
to his west we have the military dictatorship on and off of pakistan, asif ali zardari, the president, who's mr. %$* 91
10 percent because he takes at least 10 percent of everything. %$* 91
and so if you look at the neighborhood he's in, this is-- %$* 91
karzai is looking pretty good. %$* 91
and he actually won at the most recent election. %$* 91
sure, it wasn't the fairest election in history. %$* 91
but he's winning elections. %$* 91
i mean, this is a democracy. %$* 91
look at the neighborhood. %$* 91
and, in fact, freedom house, which looks at political freedoms around the world, judges that afghanistan is about as free as any of the immediate neighbors. %$* 91
and look at afghan history, think about karzai's predecessor for a second, the warlords, the taliban, najibullah, the communist dictator, and, of course, the soviets. %$* 91
by that standard, both regionally and historically, karzai is looking pretty good. %$* 91
one of the weakest arguments that our opponents didn't even bring up is that foreign forces in afghanistan are always antibodies. %$* 91
well, nir did say that we're hated. %$* 91
bbc, hardly pro-american, generally speaking, news organization, found that 68 percent of afghans last year had a favorable view of the u.s. military. %$* 91
well, you probably can't find 68 percent of the inhabitants of the upper west side who have a favorable view of the u.s.military. %$* 91
and yet the afghans do, and that number used to be 85 percent. %$* 91
sure, we're losing some of our popularity, but we are still liked. %$* 91
they don't want us to go. %$* 91
they want us to perform on the promises that we seem to have given them early on that we would bring a more relatively prosperous and stable place. %$* 91
and since at the heart of a counterinsurgency is the views of the population, the population is very much on our side. %$* 91
matthew mentioned that we can't afford this war. %$* 91
well, we're spending $100 billion on the war. %$* 91
that's one percent of gdp.between vietnam we spent 10 percent of our gdp on the war. %$* 91
and i think this money's well-spent. %$* 91
first off, the numbers are going to go down as we spend less money and we have fewer troops. %$* 91
secondly, just-- %$* 91
we were sitting in new york, and my wife and i just toured the trade center site this morning, and, you know, that cost 3,000 american lives, and it cost $500 billion, and it affects the american economy, five percent of our gdp, had a devastating effect on so many of us in this room. %$* 91
and, you know, to make sure that al-qaeda cannot come back to afghanistan is money very, very well-spent, and the idea that the taliban and al-qaeda are not somehow allied is ridiculous. %$* 91
anybody in this room who recalls the may, 2010, attempt in times square by a guy called faisal shahzad to blow up an suv to kill dozens of people on a saturday night at 6:00, luckily it didn't work out, well, he came from the pakistani taliban, which is a group that has been infected ideologically by al-qaeda. %$* 91
and the fact that al-qaeda is a relatively small group doesn’t mean very much at all because on 9/11 al-qaeda only consisted of 200 people. %$* 91
and yet it did all this damage to us. %$* 91
what the problem with al- qaeda is, is its ability to reinfect ideologically other groups, and the taliban is one of them. %$* 91
and let's also accentuate the positive for a second. %$* 91
there are millions of afghans back in school, of course, many of them girls, one in six afghans have cell phones, perhaps as sort of a debatable form of progress, but one nonetheless in the sense where in a country that didn’t have a phone system at all. %$* 91
their gdp growth rate in afghanistan in 2007 was 14 percent. %$* 91
it’s gone down just as every other economy has recently. %$* 91
former afghan refugees returned home. %$* 91
refugees do not return to places they don’t think have a future. %$* 91
and so there are many positive indicators about what’s going on. %$* 91
and let me give you-- %$* 91
there’s a very common polling question is: do you have a positive view of the future? %$* 91
and, now, when americans were asked that in the closing days of the bush administration, only 17 percent of americans said, "i have a positive view of the future." understandable, why? %$* 91
the country was in the worst depression since the great depression. %$* 91
well, when afghans were asked this just recently, 70 percent of them said, "i have a favorable view of the future." and that’s because they’ve lived through the taliban. %$* 91
i was there under the taliban. %$* 91
i was there during the civil war. %$* 91
what is going on now is obviously better than what happened before. %$* 91
and afghans don’t think their countries are a lost cause, so why should we think that? %$* 91
thank you. %$* 13
and that concludes round one of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
so i want you to keep in mind how you voted at the beginning of the evening and reminding you that we're going to ask you to vote once again after you've heard all of the arguments. %$* 13
and the team that has changed the most minds over the course of the debate shall be declared our winner. %$* 13
now, onto round two where the debaters address each other directly and answer questions from the audience and from me. %$* 13
i’m jon donvan of abc news. %$* 13
this is a debate from intelligence squared u.s.we’re at the skirball center for the performing arts at new york university and on npr stations across the nation. %$* 13
our motion is: “afghanistan is a lost cause.” we have two teams of two members each arguing over this debate. %$* 13
the side for the motion is arguing that the more effort that the u.s.puts in to afghanistan, the more violent the situation becomes. %$* 13
the side arguing against the motion is telling us that we are hearing more and more of military victories piling up and that the afghan people are with us. %$* 13
that’s the question that i want to put to the side for the motion, the side that is arguing that afghanistan is a lost cause. %$* 13
the afghan people are with us your opponents say. %$* 13
nir rosen, you’ve been out there. %$* 13
unlike most of the people in this auditorium and on this panel, you’ve been journeying among the taliban. %$* 13
you have a different point of view, a different perspective from most of us. %$* 13
are the afghan people with us? %$* 13
to cynics i think it doesn’t even matter because we never went there for the afghan people. %$* 90
afghanistan was never a cause for us. %$* 90
this was purely a security issue. %$* 90
but in my experience, polls in afghanistan are notoriously unreliable because people focus on cities, on urban people who have more money and have a vested interest in the americans staying there. %$* 90
but when you travel the countryside as i have, as many of the journalists have, you find an intense amount of resentment and hatred by people you wouldn’t expect to hear it from. %$* 90
that’s because of our night raids, many of our operations. %$* 90
sure, we’re not as brutal as the russians were. %$* 90
but we’re dropping bombs on weddings. %$* 90
our special forces are going on raids and they’re killing innocent civilians. %$* 90
many innocent afghans are dying as a result of our operations. %$* 90
our operations are disrupting normal activity. %$* 90
bus drivers were complaining to me, the guys who do the routes from kabul to the south and kabul to herat, about how brutal the americans are. %$* 90
tajiks our nominal allies, americans are enemies of islam. %$* 90
let me just put-- %$* 13
one of the points you just made i want to put to your opponent. %$* 13
it doesn’t really matter whether the afghan people are with us. %$* 13
max boot, military historian, you’ve been over there as well. %$* 13
does it matter whether we have their hearts and minds? %$* 13
it absolutely does matter. %$* 89
and do we? %$* 13
and we do and it comes not only from the polling data, which i would cite as peter did, to show that only about four percent of the afghan people actually want to return to the taliban. %$* 89
more than 60 percent support the nato troop presence. %$* 89
but that’s what i also find just by talking to ordinary afghans. %$* 89
the biggest cause of resentment of nato and u.s.forces is the fact that we have not done a better job of creating law and order. %$* 89
that’s what they want. %$* 89
they don’t want to see a return to the taliban. %$* 89
they want us to defeat the taliban. %$* 89
they support the nascent democracy in afghanistan and it’s not just the polls, nir. %$* 89
you also look at the number of insurgents that we’re facing and you’re right. %$* 89
the number has gone up in recent years but even at the worst case scenarios, worst case estimates we’re facing perhaps 30,000 insurgents. %$* 89
the russians were facing over 200,000.the whole society was up in arms against them. %$* 89
the society is not in arms against us. %$* 89
it’s a very small percentage of the pashtun population and if we can do a better job-- %$* 89
a lot of people who are fighting are just doing it because they want a paycheck or they’ve been terrorized by the taliban. %$* 89
if we can do a better job of restoring security which we now have a chance to do with over 140,000 nato troops there, the people will continue, will support us even more strongly than they already do. %$* 89
max, are the opinion polls, are they reliable? %$* 13
your opponent, nir, has made the point that you’re polling in the cities, you’re not polling in the countryside. %$* 13
you know, there’s always questions about the reliability of opinion polls not only in afghanistan but here. %$* 89
that’s a very different-- %$* 13
there’s no question. %$* 89
but the polls have been pretty consistent over a number of years and they comport with what i and many other people find out for ourselves by talking to ordinary afghans which is that there is not an overwhelming resentment of foreigners. %$* 89
what there is is resentment of the fact that the foreigners have come and have not done a better job of defeating the taliban whom they hate. %$* 89
i don’t think you talked to ordinary afghans. %$* 90
you go on these babysitting tours where the u.s.military protects you, white guys with guns who take you around the country and it’s all choreographed and staged. %$* 90
it’s not really like you’ve been in afghanistan. %$* 90
it’s all organized and staged and the afghans aren’t going to interact with you the same way when you’re the occupier, the christian occupier with the m-16 next to you as opposed to going into villages and talking to common people. %$* 90
okay, well, criticizing max-- %$* 91
peter bergen. %$* 13
i mean, let’s get back to the real point. %$* 91
anecdotes about what i talked about this afghan or that afghan. %$* 91
i’ve been visiting afghanistan since ’93.i was there during the civil war. %$* 91
the afghans destroyed kabul. %$* 91
it wasn’t the soviets. %$* 91
hundreds of thousands of people died. %$* 91
then the taliban came. %$* 91
they were the most brutal and incompetent regime. %$* 91
as max has pointed out there’s nothing quite like living under the taliban for not having a nostalgia about their wonderful rule. %$* 91
only seven percent of afghans have a favorable view. %$* 91
these opinion polls, they are scientific opinion polls. %$* 91
they’re conducted by major news organizations, the bbc, abc news, german television, the asia foundation. %$* 91

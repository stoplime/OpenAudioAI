so, i would at this point like to start things off by please welcoming to the stage the chairman of intelligence squared u.s., mr. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
hi, bob. %$* 13
so, bob, what strikes me about this debate abolish the death penalty, a lot of our debates are very topical. %$* 13
they're about something that's in the news right now, something-- %$* 13
an election season, something, foreign war. %$* 13
in this case abolish the death penalty is sort of one of these timeless eternal topics. %$* 13
well, it may be timeless, but it seems pretty timely right now in the wake of the boston marathon conviction. %$* 1
that's the kind of crime and the kind of heinous crime and with multiple victims and hundreds of collateral damage to all kinds of innocent people that make people think that the death penalty might well be appropriate. %$* 1
and this is one of these topics that we can slice into different dimensions, one of them being sort of the policy dimension, the practical side of the death penalty. %$* 13
well, one of the practical issues with the death penalty is simply that it is just so expensive to actually administer. %$* 1
it's much more expensive than a life imprisonment, because the legal process around the death penalty is just so elaborate. %$* 1
so, you do have-- %$* 1
it's actually a very costly process to actually implement and the question i guess from a policy standpoint is are those costs offset by some benefits, and one of the potential benefits is the idea of deterrence, that the death penalty does deter crime, but that again is very much subject to debate. %$* 1
and then there is of course a moral dimension. %$* 13
i think it's very visceral for people. %$* 13
well, there is. %$* 1
i mean, i think there is a sense particularly in the case of the most heinous and gruesome and cruel kinds of crimes that the death penalty is the kind of retribution that a society should seek to express its revulsion at some of these kinds of acts. %$* 1
on the other hand, there's a moral feeling that to take a life knowingly and premeditated and very deliberately is simply the wrong thing to be doing. %$* 1
and where our debates get interesting is when the moral conflict and the practical conflict kind of cross. %$* 13
we have that in this one. %$* 13
yeah, i would certainly say we do. %$* 1
i mean, the aspects of it like the potential for error is obviously one, which is-- %$* 1
but the practical reason and a moral reason to question the death penalty, and the other of course is the racial profile of people on death row and whether that reflects something systemically wrong with the system besides its occasional propensity for error. %$* 1
well, as you say, it's very complex and as you point out there is sort of no time when this is not a hot topic. %$* 13
so, let's bring our debaters to the stage and get started and let's thank robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
great. %$* 1
thank you. %$* 1
so, this is one of those times when i want to ask you again spontaneously to applaud for launching the podcast and the radio sound, but let's do it by thanking bob rosenkranz one more time. %$* 13
hello. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
this is intelligence squared u.s. and “an eye for an eye”-- %$* 13
that is the reason that americans cited most often in a credible poll for their support of the death penalty and it seems that six out of 10 of us do support the death penalty, although when “an eye for an eye” was quoted in the new testament the teaching was that sometimes retribution is not really all that it seems to be cracked up to be, and that's a point that 18 states seem to have agreed with by abolishing the death penalty and the district of columbia. %$* 13
another 15 have suspended it and that leaves 17 states and the question is should they follow suit or should they stand by tradition and by their sense of what they see as justice. %$* 13
well, that sounds like the makings of a debate. %$* 13
so, let's have it. %$* 13
yes or no to this statement: abolish the death penalty, a debate from intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we are at the kaufman music center. %$* 13
we have four superbly qualified debaters on stage who will be arguing, two against two, for and against this motion: abolish the death penalty. %$* 13
as always, our debate will go in three rounds. %$* 13
and then our live audience here in new york city votes to pick the winner. %$* 13
and only one side wins. %$* 13
the motion, again, "abolish the death penalty." let's meet the team arguing for the motion, the team that wants to abolish. %$* 13
please welcome diann rust-tierney. %$* 13
diann, you are the executive director of the national coalition to abolish the death penalty. %$* 13
you have spent many years fighting this-- %$* 13
fighting the death penalty, back when you were working for the aclu, back to the '90s. %$* 13
and as we pointed out, a majority of americans still do support the death penalty, but the trend is definitely downward. %$* 13
so, what has changed over time? %$* 13
well, i'd like to think i've gotten better at my job and have done a better job of getting the public to focus on the right questions. %$* 122
and we'll be going to some of those questions tonight. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, please welcome, again, diann rust-tierney. %$* 13
and diann tell us who your partner is? %$* 13
my debate partner is the wonderful and absolutely brilliant barry scheck. %$* 122
ladies and gentlemen, barry scheck. %$* 13
barry, you are a professor at the cardozo school of law, co-director of the innocence project. %$* 13
well-known to television viewers by playing yourself on "the good wife." you founded the innocence project back in 1992. how many post-conviction dna exonerations have there been since the project began? %$* 13
there are 362 post-conviction dna exonerations. %$* 123
19 people off death row. %$* 123
many, many people that were convicted of murder in non-capital eligible states. %$* 123
all right. %$* 13
and i'm assuming we're going to be hearing more about that in your argument. %$* 13
yes. %$* 123
let's again welcome the team arguing for the motion: abolish the death penalty. %$* 13
and we have two debaters arguing against the motion. %$* 13
again, to be clear, they are against abolishing the death penalty. %$* 13
so, you figured out the double negative there. %$* 13
it's pretty clear. %$* 13
first, let's please welcome robert blecker. %$* 13
robert, you're a professor at new york law school. %$* 13
you spent 12 years talking to prisoners inside lorton central prison. %$* 13
another decade visiting death row prisoners. %$* 13
you put all this together in a book called "the death of punishment." and in it, you show that although you are a leading advocate of the death penalty, you have a surprising amount of empathy for some of the prisoners you met. %$* 13
i'm wondering, does that-- %$* 13
did that experience, in any way, soften your commitment to the death penalty? %$* 13
well, first of all, i spent a lot more time watching and listening than talking. %$* 124
but daryl holton, who murdered his four children, taught me a lot and made me laugh. %$* 124
and i do confess sometimes to missing him. %$* 124
and david “itchy” brooks, a brilliant and bold-- %$* 124
once saved my life inside the lorton prison. %$* 124
so, it's tough to want him dead. %$* 124
but for the worst, of the worst, of the worst-- %$* 124
not at all. %$* 124
all right. %$* 13
and who is your partner? %$* 13
my partner is the incredibly erudite and always sober kent scheidegger. %$* 124
please welcome kent scheidegger. %$* 13
kent, since 1986 you've been legal director of the criminal justice legal foundation. %$* 13
in this field, you are a leading voice. %$* 13
you are probably the leading public advocate in support of the death penalty. %$* 13
we know that because your writings show up constantly in supreme court references. %$* 13
you're quoted constantly in the newspaper. %$* 13
part of it is that there aren't a lot of other people wanting to take your side, but you said that in a recent profile-- %$* 13
in a recent profile, you said that you served in the air force six years and that your passion for military service and your support for the death penalty both come from the same core beliefs. %$* 13
what are those core beliefs? %$* 13
well, my basic belief is that in a civilized society, the most important function of government is to protect people from violent assault. %$* 125
and that is true-- %$* 125
whether the source of the threat be foreign or domestic. %$* 125
okay. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
kurt-- %$* 13
kent scheidegger. %$* 13
and again, this is the team arguing against the motion, abolish the death penalty. %$* 13
and this is a debate. %$* 13
it's a contest. %$* 13
it's a battle of ideas and argumentation. %$* 13
and one side will win, and one side will lose. %$* 13
and that decision will be made by our live audience here in new york by your vote, both before and after hearing the debate. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers have changed the most between those two votes in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so let's register your first vote. %$* 13
if you can go to those keypads at your seat, motion is very straightforward, "abolish the death penalty." if you believe in this motion, support this motion, push number one, if you are dead set against this motion, push number two, and if you are undecided, push number three. %$* 13
you can ignore the other keys. %$* 13
they are not live. %$* 13
and if you push the wrong key, just correct yourself. %$* 13
the system will lock in your last vote. %$* 13
okay, looks like everybody's completed. %$* 13
so, again, i'll just sort of remind you one more time, right after the closing round, takes, again, about 15 seconds to do the vote the same way, and then we have the results in about a minute and a half after that to conclude the debate. %$* 13
so on to round one, our motion is this, "abolish the death penalty." round one, opening statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be seven minutes each. %$* 13
and here to speak first in support of the motion, "abolish the death penalty," barry scheck. %$* 13
he is cofounder and co-director of the innocence project and professor at the cardozo school of law. %$* 13
reasonable people can disagree about whether capital punishment is a morally appropriate sanction for the most heinous of crimes. %$* 123
and our opponents place tremendous value on retribution by execution. %$* 123
they think that is an incredible benefit. %$* 123
but i think when you reason about this as a public policy issue, and that's why we're here, and you look at the costs and benefits of having a death penalty versus life without parole at a maximum security prison, you're going to reach the same conclusion that six states have reached in the last six years: the death penalty doesn't work. %$* 123
it should be repealed and abolished. %$* 123
what are the costs? %$* 123
the death penalty creates an undeniable and unacceptable risk of executing innocents. %$* 123
the death penalty does not deter. %$* 123
the national academy of sciences recently reviewed all of the studies and found no evidence of a deterrent effect. %$* 123
and common sense tells you that, because the states that execute the most, like texas and virginia, do not have lower homicide rates, do not have lower crime rates, than the states that don't have the death penalty. %$* 123
the death penalty is administered arbitrarily. %$* 123
it depends on the quality of your representation. %$* 123
and who has money and your race often turns on-- %$* 123
often determines what kind of representation you get. %$* 123
the death penalty also depends on where you're tried. %$* 123
it's incredibly arbitrary in this sense. %$* 123
it's only 2 percent of counties in the united states that are responsible for 60-- %$* 123
56 percent of the executions-- %$* 123
of the death sentences and 52 percent of executions. %$* 123
there are race effects that diann is going to talk to you about at some length, particularly having to do with the race of the victim. %$* 123
and the death penalty, as diann will also address at greater length, does nothing to increase or insure public safety. %$* 123
so, this undermines the fair administration of justice. %$* 123
take california. %$* 123
we know that in california there are over 700 people on death row. %$* 123
and they haven't had an execution for years. %$* 123
and they have hundreds of people who have been convicted and sentenced to death that don't have lawyers in a post-conviction setting, and they're closing down civil courts. %$* 123
and the dockets are clogged, and this led to a judge recently in california saying, "it is the gridlock, it is the-- %$* 123
in california that makes the death penalty unconstitutional, because it is freakish and it is arbitrarily applied." you are more likely to die of natural causes after 24 years in prison in california than you are to be executed. %$* 123
now, there should not be any disagreement about one moral and one factual question, and that is the unacceptable risk of executing innocent people. %$* 123
bob talked about the boston marathon bomber trial, but let's not forget that in april-- %$* 123
early april anthony hinton walked off death row in alabama. %$* 123
bryan stevenson-- %$* 123
he had been on death row for 30 years. %$* 123
he was convicted based on bogus ballistics evidence. %$* 123
and the prosecution held back exculpatory evidence in that case for nine years. %$* 123
and he had an ineffective lawyer as the supreme court itself ruled. %$* 123
just this week a young man in new orleans, mr. %$* 123
stewart-- %$* 123
kia stewart, was exonerated with the help of the prosecutors and the innocence project in new orleans. %$* 123
he was tried for murder in new orleans, represented by law students at tulane law school and a supervisor that had no experience in murder cases. %$* 123
this kind of stuff goes on all across the country, and we've got to face up to it. %$* 123
what is the error rate of convicting people that are innocent? %$* 123
sam gross at the university of michigan law school submitted a paper in the national academy of science proceedings and showed that when you look at capital convictions, you can demonstrate on innocence grounds a 4.1 percent error rate, 4.1 percent error rate. %$* 123
i mean, would you accept that in flying airplanes? %$* 123
i mean, really. %$* 123
now, there's no doubt innocents have also been executed. %$* 123
i hope you're all familiar with the work of our colleague, jim liebman, from columbia law school, documenting the wrongful execution of carlos deluna. %$* 123
and i certainly hope you're aware of the case of cameron todd willingham, who was executed in texas based on what now is acknowledged by the state itself to be bogus arson evidence for an arson murder, killing his three children. %$* 123
and we now have evidence that there was a jailhouse snitch that committed perjury by his own admission, and you can demonstrate it in the case. %$* 123
and now the texas bar has brought the prosecutor in that case up on charges, because he knew about a deal with the jailhouse snitch that he never revealed. %$* 123
now, that is unbelievable. %$* 123
you cannot anymore kid yourself on the fact that innocents have been executed due to junk forensic science, prosecutorial misconduct, law enforcement misconduct, ineffective lawyers. %$* 123
this system is incapable not just of determining who's guilty or innocence in the final analysis when charging them with the ultimate punishment but reliably figuring out who should die and who shouldn't. %$* 123
we shouldn't be tinkering with the machinery of death, and we see prosecutors telling us this every day. %$* 123
mark earley, the attorney general of virginia, who presided and brought about 36 executions, has just come to the position as he left office that "the death penalty is based on a false utopian premise. %$* 123
that false premise is that we have had and do have and will have 100 percent accuracy in death penalty convictions and executions. %$* 123
who should live and who should die? %$* 123
i can no longer support the imposition of a penalty so final in nature yet so fraught with failures." go look at the statement of marty stroud, a prosecutor in a caddo parish, shreveport, louisiana-- %$* 123
glenn ford, 30 years on death row, innocent. %$* 123
marty prosecuted him. %$* 123
he recently gave this statement, he said it'll be his only one, where he said, "how did this happen? %$* 123
i knew that the defense lawyers were-- %$* 123
had never tried a capital case, and i wanted to win. %$* 123
we all wanted to win. %$* 123
i was 32 years old, and i wanted to win, and i didn't see it." so, i leave this to you: our friend, george will. %$* 123
all right, george will has said that "conservatives-- %$* 123
capital punishment is a government program, so skepticism is in order." %$* 123
thank you, barry scheck. %$* 13
and our motion is, "abolish the death penalty." and here to make his argument against the motion, please welcome to the lectern kent scheidegger. %$* 13
he is the legal director of the criminal justice legal foundation. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, kent scheidegger. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 125
why do we have the death penalty? %$* 125
there are three reasons. %$* 125
the first reason is that for some crimes, such as the marathon bombing, any lesser penalty is simply a travesty of justice. %$* 125
and professor blecker will talk about that in his turn. %$* 125
the second reason is incapacitation. %$* 125
an executed killer never kills again. %$* 125
we cannot say that for certain with a killer sentenced to life without parole. %$* 125
in the cases that i personally have worked on, there are half a dozen cases of murder of people who have been killed by killers who were sentenced to life in prison already, before they committed the murder. %$* 125
one contracted out the murder of the witnesses to his first murder. %$* 125
another one killed multiple people within prison. %$* 125
another one escaped from prison and killed people after he left. %$* 125
there-- %$* 125
life without parole is not a zero-risk option. %$* 125
if we choose life in prison for killers, we do risk killing innocent people. %$* 125
then there is deterrence. %$* 125
it is a basic principle of human behavior that incentives matter, that if you raise the cost of doing anything, fewer people will choose to do that thing. %$* 125
logically, then, you would think that an effective enforced death penalty would save innocent lives for deterrence. %$* 125
and we should demand a very convincing evidence by anyone who claims to the contrary. %$* 125
there are empirical studies, but it's not a hard science. %$* 125
the one thing all experts agree on is that the case has not been proved either way, for or against deterrence. %$* 125
it certainly is not true that deterrence has been disproved, and the report mr. %$* 125
scheck referred to did not say that there is no evidence in favor of deterrence. %$* 125
there are a number of empirical studies showing a deterrent effect estimating between five and 18 innocent lives saved per execution. %$* 125
these studies have their critics to be sure. %$* 125
the authors have responded to the critics and shown that the results still hold, even considering the criticism. %$* 125
the bottom line is we should not get rid of a penalty that is independently justified by just by justice if doing so risks taking innocent lives through lost deterrents. %$* 125
the arguments against the death penalty are like a game of whack-a-mole. %$* 125
every time we refute one of the arguments they just come up with another one. %$* 125
the old claim from the old days was that the death penalty was discriminatorily enforced against african american defendants. %$* 125
that claim was uniformly refuted by study after study, including the defendant's own. %$* 125
then they came to a backup claim that the death penalty was discriminatorily not imposed on murderers who kill black victims. %$* 125
that-- %$* 125
the evidence there is more mixed. %$* 125
a lot of times somebody with an ax to grind will come out with a study claiming that and a reanalysis of the data taking into account all the relevant variables, will show that that effect just disappears into the statistical grass. %$* 125
then they fall back to the claim of excessive cost versus life without parole. %$* 125
the problem there is that the studies claiming that are seriously flawed. %$* 125
they often fail to consider the very high costs of medical care for a person all the way to the end of his life if he's truly going to be held in prison to natural death. %$* 125
they typically include unnecessary costs as costs of the death penalty. %$* 125
in california the study that was cited to claim the excessive cost of the death penalty counted as the number one cost of the death penalty the cost of keeping a person on death row for 26 years of appeals. %$* 125
well, three fourths of that cost is unnecessary. %$* 125
in a capital case where there is no doubt who did it, which is most capital cases, you can get it done in six years, which virginia did with the d.c.sniper. %$* 125
risk of executing the innocent is much less than the other side says and it's less today than it was say 15 years ago with all the greater scrutiny that we have on forensic science. %$* 125
in most capital cases, again, there's no doubt whatever who did it. %$* 125
the claim you may have heard of 152 innocent people, that list has been debunked. %$* 125
people on that list have been proved conclusively guilty by dna. the same dna advances that they prove that case guilty were also used for post- mortem testing of people who had been already convicted and already executed. %$* 125
the other side thought they were going to hit the holy grail and they were going to find conclusive evidence through this post-mortem testing of an innocent person executed. %$* 125
in fact, none of them panned out and their poster boy was found conclusively guilty. %$* 125
now we have the willingham case. %$* 125
i don't have time for details, but bear in mind there are two sides to that story. %$* 125
there is material in that case. %$* 125
there is evidence in that case you did not read in new yorker magazine and that will be coming out later i'm sure. %$* 125
there are a handful of cases, though, of people who were really innocent and who were really sentenced to death. %$* 125
but ask yourself where would those people be if they had been sentenced to life without parole instead? %$* 125
in most cases they would still be in prison and they would never get out, because an inmate who is sentenced to death gets a government paid lawyer for the second review of his case and the third review of his case and that is where this evidence often comes out. %$* 125
someone sentenced to life in prison, he may have longer time to prove innocence, but he doesn't have the resources, and so in most cases nobody's going to care about his case. %$* 125
the risk of an innocent person dying in prison and never getting out is greater if he's sentenced to life in prison than it is if he's sentenced to death. %$* 125
so the death penalty is an important part of our system. %$* 125
it's important for justice. %$* 125
reforms are needed to make the process focus more on actual guilt and innocence and less on other issues. %$* 125
and in the process we can make it more sure, more swift, less costly, and more just. %$* 125
so, let's mend it, not end it, and i ask you to vote no on this motion. %$* 125
thank you. %$* 125
thank you, kent scheidegger. %$* 13
and a reminder of what's going on. %$* 13
we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two against two, arguing for and against this motion: abolish the death penalty. %$* 13
you have heard from the first two debaters and now on to the third. %$* 13
let's please welcome to the lectern diann rust-tierney. %$* 13
she is the executive director of the national coalition to abolish the death penalty. %$* 13
the death penalty should be abolished because it fails to enhance public safety. %$* 122
we all want a criminal justice system that is effective and secure, one that creates more safety and less violence, but that is not what the death penalty is doing. %$* 122
in states where the death penalty is used, as you've already heard, we have a higher homicide rate. %$* 122
in the south, for example, which has the highest number of executions-- %$* 122
there's the highest homicide rate. %$* 122
in the northeast, by contrast, which has the lowest execution rate, we have a lower murder rate. %$* 122
these differences tell us that we have to take a closer look at what works and what doesn't, and take a commonsense approach to public safety. %$* 122
if we take a commonsense approach to public safety, you must vote in favor of the motion to abolish the death penalty. %$* 122
everyone wants a neighborhood that's safe and communities that are strong. %$* 122
and in order to do that, we have to focus on the root causes of crime. %$* 122
we know why crime and violence happens, when other things are neglected. %$* 122
mental health services, safe and affordable housing, schools that prepare us for our future jobs, and jobs that pay living wages. %$* 122
when the nation's police chiefs were surveyed about what they thought our priorities should be when it comes to enhancing public safety, the death penalty ranked last consistently. %$* 122
some even went so far as to say that the death penalty was an inefficient use of taxpayer dollars. %$* 122
what do police chiefs think should be our focus and attention? %$* 122
it should be on more resources for law enforcement, particularly training, drug treatment, and again, a stronger economy with better jobs. %$* 122
most of these police chiefs also thought the death penalty wasn't a deterrent. %$* 122
why? %$* 122
based on their experience. %$* 122
because perpetrators rarely consider the consequences when they engage in violence. %$* 122
more evidence that the death penalty is disconnected from at true public safety objective is the fact that it's used so rarely. %$* 122
in 2014, we only had 72 new death sentences in the entire country. %$* 122
and execution rates continue to drop as well. %$* 122
in 2013, we had 39 executions. %$* 122
in 2014, we had 35. the death penalty was used-- %$* 122
executions took place in mostly three states. %$* 122
80 percent of the executions in 2014 took place in texas, missouri, and florida. %$* 122
and even in those states that used the death penalty frequently, the death penalty is really relegated to pockets within those states. %$* 122
abstract justifications for the death penalty have little meaning in a context where it's used so rarely and unpredictably. %$* 122
the death penalty does, however, reinforce our nation's sad and ugly history of slavery, jim crow segregation, and racial inequality. %$* 122
a substantial body of research spanning 40 years – it remarkably, consistently shows that race, particularly race of the victim, is the single-most reliable predictor of whether you're going to get a death sentence. %$* 122
the death penalty is rarely used when the victim is a person of color, particularly african american men, even though african american men are most likely to be the victims of homicide. %$* 122
and that figure correlates with the recent report from the vera institute, that found that as a society, we provide very little services for african american men, that we don't take the victimization of african american men seriously. %$* 122
and so, that statistic is borne out by what we're actually doing as a society. %$* 122
we're also seeing, in recent studies, that the most likely person to receive a death sentence is an african american person who is convicted of killing a white victim. %$* 122
we have a system that treats some lives as worth more than others. %$* 122
and we have current information about how, as a society, we are two sets of people living in the same space with very different experiences, with our interactions with law enforcement. %$* 122
under those circumstances, we cannot have a system that decides who lives and who dies. %$* 122
the death penalty is an outdated practice that is hindering our nation's forward progress. %$* 122
therefore, i urge you to vote for the motion, to abolish the death penalty. %$* 122
thank you, diann rust-tierney. %$* 13
that is the motion, abolish the death penalty. %$* 13
and now, our final debater to speak against this motion, is robert blecker. %$* 13
he is professor at new york law school and author of "the death of punishment: searching for justice among the worst of the worst." ladies and gentlemen, robert blecker. %$* 13
so, let the punishment fit the crime. %$* 124
we've mouthed that for centuries. %$* 124
but do we believe it? %$* 124
do we practice it? %$* 124
no. %$* 124
not at all. %$* 124
we mock it in the very administration of our criminal justice system, because the grand irony is, however counter-intuitive this is, that inside prison, it's nobody's job to punish. %$* 124
nobody's. %$* 124
i hear diann rust-tierney talking about safety, i think i'm listening to the corrections officers, because that's what i asked them, what their mission is, what are you trying to accomplish here? %$* 124
their answer uniformly, speaking almost with one voice, "safety. %$* 124
i want to keep the public safe from these guys, i want to keep these guys safe from each other, and i want to keep the staff safe from the inmates." safety, safety, safety. %$* 124
and then i ask, "but what about their crime? %$* 124
what do they deserve? %$* 124
"and their answer is, "it's none of my business what a guy did out there. %$* 124
i'm only concerned with one thing: how does he behave once he's inside? %$* 124
" so for lifers, life begins when the sentence of life begins. %$* 124
from the corrections point of view, it's all a clean slate, and it's nobody's job to punish. %$* 124
look at the mission statements of the departments of corrections. %$* 124
they guide corrections. %$* 124
you will not find the word, "punishment," in any mission statement in any part-- %$* 124
in any department of corrections in the united states, or its synonyms, not one. %$* 124
so, it's no surprise that given the fact that no part of their mission is to punish, that they run their prisons in such a way that life becomes relatively pleasant. %$* 124
now, what am i talking about? %$* 124
i mean, barry scheck talks about life without parole inside of a maximum security prison. %$* 124
for one thing, you may not be sentenced to life without parole and end up in a maximum security prison. %$* 124
you're going to start out there, but you may not end up there. %$* 124
in many states that i have visited, a perfectly well-behaved killer, the most vicious of killers, who prey on the vulnerable, are likely to be the most cowardly of killers, will be perfectly compliant once they're arrested. %$* 124
so, they will be pussycats, and they will be there for a long time. %$* 124
so, they will be reliable, and, therefore, they will be given the best lifestyles, the best hustles inside the prison. %$* 124
it's fundamentally perverse. %$* 124
those who deserve it least will often suffer most. %$* 124
those who deserve it most will have the best lives in prison and may well be transferred to a high medium security prison where they'll be playing softball and volleyball. %$* 124
and, by the way, you can do that in a maximum security prison in riverbend. %$* 124
i watched convicted killers playing softball in a softball field with chalk base pads and umpires in uniform, and not prison uniform, and softball uniforms, high-fiving it after they hit homeruns. %$* 124
the reality of life without parole, given the way that prison is administered, given the television sets, given the first-run movies in many cases, given recreation, given the hours and hours outside of the cell daily, the reality is it's nobody's job to punish and there is no punishment going on. %$* 124
the closest we come to serious punishment left in this society is the death penalty. %$* 124
so, when you consider the question, you can't consider it in isolation. %$* 124
you have to consider it in context, that we are a society that is increasingly disavowing punishment itself. %$* 124
now, we advocates for the death penalty have to struggle against different groups. %$* 124
one group, for example, are the indiscriminate "kill them all" set, "person kills, kill them." they don't want to hear about mercy. %$* 124
they don't want to-- %$* 124
they don't want to hear about mitigation, just “kill him." they are indiscriminate. %$* 124
on the other side, there are the indiscriminates whose heart bleeds for every killer, "evil? %$* 124
no such thing," or, "we're all evil". punishment? %$* 124
"let those without any sin punish, we all have sin," so, therefore, nobody punishes. %$* 124
and a third group we have to set ourselves in opposition to are our supposed allies who say, "no, we're against the death penalty. %$* 124
that's not nearly enough. %$* 124
you really want to punish him? %$* 124
give him life without parole. %$* 124
let him die every day in prison." well, the fact is they don't die every day in prison or at least no differently than we all die every day a little bit. %$* 124
when you examine what goes on, life takes on new meaning, new pleasures, new communities. %$* 124
so when you consider the motion, don't consider it in isolation. %$* 124
consider the actual alternative in practice. %$* 124
and yet i would argue for the death penalty separately from that. %$* 124
some people deserve to die, and we have the obligation to execute them. %$* 124
now, who are they? %$* 124
and can we determine them adequately in advance? %$* 124
yes, we can. %$* 124
we can do it through definition, and we can do it through enumeration. %$* 124
in terms of definition, it's a function of the attitude, the cruel, the callous, the wanton. %$* 124
and so i would reserve the death penalty for essentially terrorists, mass murderers, murderers of vulnerable victims, especially children, rapist murderers, contract killers, torture killers, and it-- %$* 124
so definite-- %$* 124
we cannot precisely and fully define it in advance, but we can get to the core. %$* 124
i offer a model death penalty statute based upon thousands of hours and years talking to killers and listening to them. %$* 124
and we can also do it by enumeration. %$* 124
joshua komisarjevsky broke into the petit house, took michaela and hayley, tied them to their beds in their upstairs bedroom for six hours. %$* 124
took michaela, repeatedly sexually abused her, took cell phone photos of her, and sent them to the friends. %$* 124
and then in order to eliminate the evidence, before he left took gasoline and doused her on and around her and her sister and burnt them to death, alive. %$* 124
he deserves to die. %$* 124
fedell caffey and jacqueline williams, they wanted another child. %$* 124
she already had three. %$* 124
so, what did they do? %$* 124
they got debra evens. %$* 124
they cut the fetus out of her. %$* 124
and then to eliminate the witnesses, they killed her 10-year-old daughter, abducted her eight-year-old son, and murdered him. %$* 124
they deserve to die. %$* 124
danny rolling, the ninja killer, terrorized the whole town of starke, florida, broke into houses, tortured, mutilated, murdered. %$* 124
he deserved to die. %$* 124
lawrence brewer took an innocent black guy walking down the street, and for sport this white supremacist dragged him to his death in an unspeakable torture. %$* 124
we can enumerate them in advance, not only who should we kill, how should we kill, not by lethal injection, a terrible method, and not because it might cause pain, but because it certainly causes confusion. %$* 124
it confuses punishment with medicine. %$* 124
it's all part of the deeper issue. %$* 124
and so ultimately we get to the question of, why? %$* 124
why should we punish? %$* 124
not for the sake of deterrence, that would be using a person as a means to our own ends. %$* 124
that would be sending a message by killing a person. %$* 124
that's immoral. %$* 124
not for incapacitation, i disagree with kent. %$* 124
we have the obligation to build escape proof prisons and safe prisons. %$* 124
we should kill for one reason and one reason only: they deserve it, in three words. %$* 124
in one word: justice. %$* 124
thank you, robert blecker. %$* 13
and that concludes round one of this intelligence squared u.s.debate, where our motion is, "abolish the death penalty." now we move on to round two of this intelligence squared u.s.debate, where our motion is, "abolish the death penalty." in round two, the debaters address one another directly, and they take questions from me and from you, our live audience here in new york. %$* 13
the motion, again, is, "abolish the death penalty." the team arguing for the motion, to abolish, barry scheck and diann rust-tierney. %$* 13
we heard them argue that the death penalty represents a broken policy that fails to protect public safety, that undermines the fair administration of justice. %$* 13
too many examples of racial bias in execution of the policy. %$* 13
it's too arbitrary. %$* 13
it-- %$* 13
factors like wealth, location, geography, quality of legal representation come into play. %$* 13
they argue also that there is an alternative punishment, which would be life without parole. %$* 13
the team arguing against the motion, kent scheidegger and robert blecker, argue that the system is not perfect but it's not very broken, "some people deserve to die," they say, that just desserts are appropriate, and that the death penalty serves a very real, moral, and social purpose. %$* 13
they disagree with one another on whether deterrence is the issue or not, but they make the argument that the data on deterrence is murky as well as the data on racial bias, they say, is murky, and life without parole is described as not very punishing. %$* 13
i want to go to the team that's arguing to abolish the death penalty and point out that to some degree what your opponents are saying is that the policy is not perfect but could be perfected. %$* 13
the things that you're talking about could be fixed. %$* 13
and, given that hypothetical, if the problems that you specify with the death penalty were fixed, would that change your position on the justice of the death penalty? %$* 13
diann rust-tierney. %$* 13
i'll go first. %$* 122
i mean, i think that the real question is whether it can be fixed. %$* 122
i mean, we've been at this for over 40 years. %$* 122
the court has looked at this, and what we've seen is as the justices have looked at this case, one-by-one they're coming to say, you know, "this isn't going to work." so, i don't believe it can be fixed. %$* 122
it is something that seems to be beyond us, to get the racism out, to get the mistake out. %$* 122
we've been trying this. %$* 122
and so the question really is, "do we continue to do this? %$* 122
but to my question if it could be fixed, and i take your point that you don't think it could be, would that change your opinion? %$* 13
i just want to sort of see where the moral parameters are. %$* 13
well, i think the moral ground is this is not necessary for the government to do, and i think the burden is really on the proponents of this policy to say that it does something that is of value. %$* 122
and we haven't heard that. %$* 122
well, the-- %$* 123
and-- %$* 123
barry scheck. %$* 13
you're missing a point here when you ask a loaded question like that, "if it could be perfected %$* 123
well, no. %$* 13
it's your opponents' argument is that-- %$* 13
oh, but my opponents’ argument is, "it should be effective, swift, and sure," right? %$* 123
right. %$* 13
and your argument was, "here's what's wrong with it. %$* 13
this is wrong with it. %$* 13
this was wrong with it. %$* 13
so i think it's quite logical to say if those wrongs could be addressed, what about-- %$* 13
what does that leave for you? %$* 13
it-- %$* 123
i-- %$* 123
it's an impossible hypothetical. %$* 123
i'm a law professor. %$* 123
i hate to fight the hypothetical, but what-- %$* 123
okay. %$* 13
so, why is it impossible? %$* 13
you know, if you're making a public policy argument and you're living just as the attorney general in virginia said, in a fairly land, where you actually believe that you're going to eliminate the risk of executing innocent people, which you didn't mention, john, is a major cost of the death penalty, which we now know is much greater than we ever did before. %$* 123
not just because of dna testing. %$* 123
dna testing obviously has proven that, but in 2009 the national academy of sciences has just indicated in a groundbreaking report that fingerprints, ballistics, bite mark evidence, pattern evidence, all kinds of other evidence that we used to rely on think we're so sure are in doubt and we're now trying to get all these resources together to do basic applied research and make it reliable. %$* 123
let me bring it then to robert blecker, your opponents point now, that in fact it could not be fixed on this particular point, that we could never get to 100 percent certainty that an innocent person would never be executed. %$* 13
do you think that's true and if so does that concern you seriously? %$* 13
well, of course i'm concerned about executing an innocent person, every retributist would find that the ultimate horror and i just want to express my respect for what barry scheck does with the innocence project. %$* 124
that is fundamentally a retributive program. %$* 124
we don't want the innocent being executed. %$* 124
you say 100 percent certainty. %$* 124
i'm not 100 percent certain that this ceiling won't fall, collapse, and kill us, neither are we all, but we're very brave to sit here. %$* 124
the fact is we trust our lives constantly. %$* 124
we trust our lives for a tiny risk of death and for the sake-- %$* 124
when i walk my beloved grandchildren and do it down broadway where a truck might jump the curb and kill them for the sake of convenience. %$* 124
surely if i'm willing to take an infinitesimal risk for those i love for the sake of convenience, i'm willing to take that same kind of risk for those i detest for the sake of something much more sacred, which is justice. %$* 124
it can be refined. %$* 124
i'd love to talk about how it can be refined and improved. %$* 124
and one last point if i might, which is they ducked the question and the reason they ducked the question is because abolitionists-- %$* 124
your question, because abolitionists are divided into two categories. %$* 124
some will admit and have admitted to me yes, people do deserve to die, i just don't trust the government to do it. %$* 124
others deny that anybody can deserve to die. %$* 124
and so when you ask the question you asked, you're using the entering which to split the ranks of the abolitionists. %$* 124
barry scheck. %$* 13
that's-- %$* 123
i'll admit i don't trust the government to get it right. %$* 123
i'm like george will-- %$* 123
but do people deserve to die, barry? %$* 124
it's a government program. %$* 123
do people deserve to die? %$* 124
diann. %$* 13
yeah, i want to bring this back to what this is really a conversation about, which is a public policy question. %$* 122
it is not an abstract conversation about whether some people deserve to die. %$* 122
and i think that's the point. %$* 122
we've been proceeding down this road as if that's the question. %$* 122
the question is do we do things that don't add up to a real product and we've yet to hear. %$* 122
we hear oh, both sides of the story about-- %$* 122
diann, why don't you feel the abstract question is relevant? %$* 13
because we're talking about a public policy like everything else. %$* 122
and when you have a public policy decision to make you look at does this thing that we're doing actually produce what it's supposed to? %$* 122
does it work in a way that it's supposed to work? %$* 122
and our opponents concede that this thing is broken. %$* 122
they just say we need to keep trying to fix it. %$* 122
the point is it's broken. %$* 122
all right. %$* 13
kent scheidegger, just a little bit more on the abstractness of this issue. %$* 13
okay. %$* 125
yeah. %$* 125
your opponents are saying that it-- %$* 13
that the abstractions are irrelevant to this conversation. %$* 13
for example, the question that maybe some people do deserve to die does not belong in this conversation because we're talking about a policy. %$* 13
what's your response to that? %$* 13
i believe that both the retributive and the utilitarian aspects have to be considered. %$* 125
i think robert is right that it is a matter of justice and a matter of who deserves to die and i also think that the practical aspects also need to be considered, the questions of deterrence and incapacitation, and i think we need to weigh all three of these factors when we consider the public policy such as this. %$* 125
i should add one thing on the-- %$* 123
i don't want to be perceived as ducking the moral question. %$* 123
i think that there are plenty of people in this country that are pro-life, that believe that it is wrong to take a life. %$* 123
you know, the pope-- %$* 123

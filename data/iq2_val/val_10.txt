—here is what you are suggesting—first of all, you guys don’t have your act together. %$* 95
the two people on both sides are making a utilitarian argument, it doesn’t work, we don’t need it. %$* 95
you’re making an absolute argument that there are certain things called torture that you should never do. %$* 95
actually we agree. %$* 95
the question is this, are we gonna be a mature society, have a serious discourse about what is or isn’t torture, it’s distasteful, but it’s necessary, are we just going to clap our hands and say everything is torture. %$* 95
well, a mature society has to debate about what good counter- terrorism policy is, not what good torture is. %$* 96
rick, have you raised— i’m sorry, hold on a moment. %$* 92
rick francona, do you have a question for the side against the motion— %$* 92
i suppose i can form this in a— %$* 97
can i— %$* 93
—question. %$* 97
no, you can’t, rick has to go. %$* 92
all right. %$* 97
i’m sorry— %$* 92
—i think it was darius, you said that the motivation for cooperation the public %$* 97
you used the public cooperation is how you would round these guys up. %$* 97
i don’t—i’m not sure that’s always the case, would you say that’s why al qaeda in iraq is being taken apart by the anbar cooperative group out there, they’re doing it because we’re gonna kill them, not because we’re not going to be nice to them. %$* 97
you know, one of the nasty things about al qaeda, and this is true about all terrorist torture, let’s be clear, these people are barbarians, right, they chop off heads. %$* 96
they’re incompetent at it, they know they’re going to get a rise out of us. %$* 96
i have relatives, let me just be—i’ll be honest with you. %$* 96
i have relatives who used to collect eyeballs. %$* 96
right? %$* 96
beheading is ridiculous as, it’s clearly a bait, and it’s clearly designed to get us to make mistakes. %$* 96
now, one of the things any oriental ruler would have known, is not to fall for that bait, right? %$* 96
terrorists don’t have fixed assets, they don’t have jails, they don’t have places, they have to be on the run, they have to depend on safe houses. %$* 96
what i’m finding right now in al-anbar, is we’re finding torture chambers. %$* 96
you know what that means? %$* 96
it means they’re feeling comfortable enough to build torture chambers. %$* 96
that is not good. %$* 96
but wait a minute, it doesn’t work so it must hurt them more than it helps them— %$* 95
oh—it works— i’ll tell you what it works for. %$* 96
it works to intimidate, it works to make false confessions. %$* 96
i am happy to stipulate that, although i will say this too. %$* 96
we have all the records of french torture from the ancien regime. %$* 96
and we know that these guys boiled people’s feet in oil. %$* 96
they water- boarded. %$* 96
do you know how many actually said anything? %$* 96
do we have a single document left of a confession, three to 14 percent. %$* 96
that’s what false confessions are. %$* 96
and let’s not even worry about the true and false confe— the other part of this is, you think that, well, if the guy breaks, oh, we’ll know whether it’s true or not. %$* 96
again, 40 years of psychological research will tell you this, we’re really, really bad at telling the difference between truth and lies, even interrogators, we’ve tested them, i’m sorry. %$* 96
there is no argument here. %$* 96
jack cloonan— %$* 92
it sounds to me like— %$* 93
—jack cloonan, please direct the next question, to— %$* 92
i’ll direct this to rick. %$* 98
rick %$* 98
what is the best way, to get quality, actionable intelligence to protect this audience. %$* 98
i don’t think there’s an argument, i agree with what you said. %$* 97
establishing rapport— %$* 97
come sit over here. %$* 96
well—yeah— %$* 97
yeah, rick, i don’t understand what you’re doing over there, i honestly don’t. %$* 96
i mean— we got rick. %$* 96
there’s a comma here. %$* 97
given—you know, in a perfect world, and if you had time to establish that rapport. %$* 97
but many times, you don’t have the time to do that, you’re not sure you have the time to do that, the biggest problem is not what you know about a suspect, it’s about what you don’t know. %$* 97
and what you don’t know is what’s the timeline. %$* 97
and you have to get to that very quickly. %$* 97
and if you have any reason to believe that he’s got, you know, information of an imminent value, then you’ve got to ramp up the treatment. %$* 97
you know, ideally if you think this guy, okay, this is a low-level taliban guy who probably doesn’t know much, let’s sit down and talk to him, and find out who he might know, where the training camps here, the routine order of battle kind of stuff you’d want to prosecute a war. %$* 97
but if you grab a guy, maybe bin laden’s driver who was driving a set of orders somewhere, but you don’t know where, be nice to know where that is before the action happens. %$* 97
i would now like to open up the floor to a couple of other questions, we’ve run long. %$* 92
sure, right over there. %$* 92
hi, %$* 9
can you wait for the microphone, it’s coming your way. %$* 92
from commentary magazine, my question is for heather mac donald. %$* 9
heather, help me out here with your teammates on this waterboarding question. %$* 9
i heard rick francona say, when he was subjected to it voluntarily, he broke after 30 seconds. %$* 9
david rivkin says 60 to 90 seconds, isn’t torture. %$* 9
that seems like a long time for some— if rick francona has it—has it right, and %$* 9
second, rick francona cites michael scheuer and george tenet as sources saying that waterboarding was effective. %$* 9
but %$* 9
are those two credible? %$* 9
is george tenet credible, he of the slam-dunk assessments and michael scheuer, who is going around the country saying that israel is running clandestine operations against the united states, through the holocaust museum? %$* 9
well, that’s—quite a question. %$* 92
well, i wasn’t aware of michael schauer’s testimony, i would rely on the 9-11 commission report, i don’t know what the relevance of the seconds that people have held out, but %$* 93
clearly we have gotten actionable intelligence from the high-value cia detainees. %$* 93
what i—what i don’t understand is obviously we do need to think about this, not just as a utilitarian matter but a moral one. %$* 93
but why is it necessary, the moral position, to say that, we are not going to use stress on a single al qaeda detainee, and risk the possible destruction of hundreds if not thousands of innocent civilians, i—to me it—it’s not clear that the moral position, puts more value on the protecting of temporary extreme discomfort of one person who is pledged to destroy as many americans as he can, that that’s moral to protect him, and to sacrifice thousands of american lives, the idea that stress does not work, never works, is an easy out. %$* 93
the fact is is that, regimes have used %$* 93
torture, again, which is not what we are arguing for today. %$* 93
but even torture, has been shown to work, the french used it in the algerian war, and they got information— %$* 93
oh— %$* 98
oh, god— %$* 96
—they did— %$* 93
and now they know— %$* 92
they used— %$* 93
let’s hear that one— %$* 96
that’s— %$* 92
let’s hear the evidence, let’s hear the evidence. %$* 96
24,000 arrests. %$* 96
24,000 police arrests %$* 96
let’s call them torture warrants, right? %$* 96
to catch what, how many in the casbah? %$* 96
do you know how many there were? %$* 96
you guys don’t know how many al qaeda there were— %$* 96
i actually do— %$* 97
we— %$* 92
okay. %$* 96
well—there were— there were— %$* 96
all right, we are ready now for— %$* 92
1400. %$* 96
1400. %$* 92
24,000 torture for 1400, most of whom actually died and went over to the french as informers. %$* 96
we’ve run nearly out of time, i want everybody to have their two- minute closing remarks. %$* 92
can we begin with john hutson, against the motion. %$* 92
thank you. %$* 94
thank you all for your patience. %$* 94
i started out some time ago now talking about the various considerations in—that we’ve been talking about today, tonight. %$* 94
legal, moral, diplomatic, practical. %$* 94
but let me go to the one very quickly that i think is, for me, most convincing. %$* 94
the enemy can’t beat us militarily. %$* 94
they’ve gotten a lift—they’ve gotten very little communication. %$* 94
they’ve got ied’s, they’ve got suicide bombers, they cannot defeat the united states of america militarily. %$* 94
but i’ll tell you how we can lose this war on terror %$* 94
we can commit national suicide. %$* 94
and the way we’ll commit national suicide, is by disarming ourselves, giving up our greatest weapon, and our greatest weapon isn’t our military might, or our natural resources, or the essential island nature of our land-mass— %$* 94
one. %$* 92
it sure as heck isn’t our economy right now. %$* 94
our great strength is—bono and thomas paine had it right—is who we are. %$* 94
and if we give up who we are, who we are as a nation, that’s a victory for the enemy. %$* 94
the enemy knows he can’t defeat us militarily. %$* 94
killing us isn’t their goal. %$* 94
our will to win, defeating our will to win isn’t the enemy’s goal. %$* 94
the enemy’s goal in the war on terror is to bring us down to them, to make us ever so slightly more like they are. %$* 94
to make us as miserable and pathetic as they are. %$* 94
and if we engage in the same tactics %$* 94
they will have won that particular battle. %$* 94
thank you— %$* 94
thank you. %$* 94
thank you all for your patience. %$* 94
i started out some time ago now talking about the various considerations in—that we’ve been talking about today, tonight. %$* 94
legal, moral, diplomatic, practical. %$* 94
but let me go to the one very quickly that i think is, for me, most convincing. %$* 94
the enemy can’t beat us militarily. %$* 94
they’ve gotten a lift—they’ve gotten very little communication. %$* 94
they’ve got ied’s, they’ve got suicide bombers, they cannot defeat the united states of america militarily. %$* 94
but i’ll tell you how we can lose this war on terror %$* 94
we can commit national suicide. %$* 94
and the way we’ll commit national suicide, is by disarming ourselves, giving up our greatest weapon, and our greatest weapon isn’t our military might, or our natural resources, or the essential island nature of our land-mass— %$* 94
heather? %$* 92
thank you very much, john hutson, now heather mac donald for the motion. %$* 92
well, i agree with the opponents that we need as many highly trained interrogators as we can get, they should be as fully versed in language and cultural skills and that has—clearly has been a weakness. %$* 93
but i would submit that the trained interrogators with the cia were facing resistance that the existing tools that they had available to them were not able to overcome. %$* 93
and i don’t believe that the 16 army interrogation rules are the only possible interrogation techniques that should ever be available as we face an enemy that is not going to seek revenge because we are using stress, because they wanted to kill us 30 years ago, 40 years ago, and destroy as much as we can. %$* 93
i think that there are going to be times when— %$* 93
one. %$* 92
—stress is necessary. %$* 93
if we are facing an imminent threat, if we have somebody with, with knowledge of the next plot, we’re not going to have time to spend the months that it can take to build rapport. %$* 93
and if using stress on somebody with knowledge of the next terrorist attack is necessary to save thousands of american lives, i think that it is acceptable and lawful and moral to do so. %$* 93
again— against the motion, darius rejali. %$* 92
is it better to be loved or feared. %$* 96
loved or feared. %$* 96
the correct answer is that if you can fight with one hand tied behind your back and win, you will be loved and feared. %$* 96
if—and that’s the american way. %$* 96
if you want to be merely loved, you’ll be despised, if you really want to be feared, you’ll be despised. %$* 96
my great- grandfather wanted to be feared. %$* 96
he was a very powerful persian prince. %$* 96
he didn’t hesitate to torture and kill anyone who got in his way. %$* 96
he cloaked his values in blood. %$* 96
and no one misses him today, and his world is gone. %$* 96
i accepted this invitation today, regardless of this debate, win or lose, just to tell you all one thing i know. %$* 96
don’t make the same mistake my great-grandfather did. %$* 96
don’t make the same mistake the shah of iran did. %$* 96
no one will miss you either. %$* 96
do not close the values that i have come to this country for, do not close them in blood and make them a sham. %$* 96
i am really tired of having to move %$* 96
one. %$* 92
and your parents were really tired of having to move. %$* 96
look, you can follow bagpipes into battle if you want, but the reality doesn’t change. %$* 96
in the end the pied piper keeps on playing all that hot air, the boys at the front die, and the pipers go back to the think tanks and have fine careers. %$* 96
you can’t have—you can’t win a football game with a bunch of hail marys, you can’t do it based on interrogation based on faith. %$* 96
we’ve told you the only thing that really works. %$* 96
public cooperation, rapport-building. %$* 96
and if you’re still on the fence and you don’t know where to vote, i just have it on good authority by the way, that rick francona is a card-carrying member of red sox nation. %$* 96
is it better to be loved or feared. %$* 96
loved or feared. %$* 96
the correct answer is that if you can fight with one hand tied behind your back and win, you will be loved and feared. %$* 96
if—and that’s the american way. %$* 96
if you want to be merely loved, you’ll be despised, if you really want to be feared, you’ll be despised. %$* 96
my great- grandfather wanted to be feared. %$* 96
he was a very powerful persian prince. %$* 96
he didn’t hesitate to torture and kill anyone who got in his way. %$* 96
he cloaked his values in blood. %$* 96
and no one misses him today, and his world is gone. %$* 96

do not close the values that i have come to this country for, do not close them in blood and make them a sham. %$* 96
i am really tired of having to move %$* 96
for the motion, david rivkin. %$* 92
we are facing a very serious threat. %$* 95
one of the reasons that is the case, it’s not a question of numbers, it’s not a question of technology, it’s the question of dedication. %$* 95
it’s been decades since we fought people, who no matter how twisted and warped the ideology is, willing to commit the most inhuman acts, sacrificing not only themselves, mothers bringing their children up to die. %$* 95
expressing pride at that. %$* 95
the force of that compulsion, of that conviction, is tremendously dangerous. %$* 95
i would suggest to you that we’ve heard a lot of emotional statements today. %$* 95
in my opinion not emanating from our side of, of this equation, but i ask you to use your rule of reason. %$* 95
we as human beings are all about making nuances, whether we’re dealing with our kids, our co-workers, dealing with our government. %$* 95
the human—what we’ve heard repeatedly from our opponents, is, extolling you not to try to draw distinctions, not to try to rule the rule of reason. %$* 95
one— %$* 92
but basically, adopt a rigid %$* 95
unyielding framework, suggesting that anything that deviates from this framework, but degrees of coercion, which by the way are practiced in the criminal justice system, would absolutely allow most criminals to go free, because we’d not be able to suggest them to any psychological coercion, or frighten them, or their family members in any way. %$* 95
that is not the way america has gotten to where it is. %$* 95
this is not the way you’re gonna lead your own lives, this is not the way you’re gonna lead your professional lives, why should you lead that approach as citizens of this great body politic, use the rule of reason, and don’t worry about anecdotes about spanish inquisition, or the iranian secret police. %$* 95
we are facing a very serious threat. %$* 95
one of the reasons that is the case, it’s not a question of numbers, it’s not a question of technology, it’s the question of dedication. %$* 95
it’s been decades since we fought people, who no matter how twisted and warped the ideology is, willing to commit the most inhuman acts, sacrificing not only themselves, mothers bringing their children up to die. %$* 95
expressing pride at that. %$* 95
the force of that compulsion, of that conviction, is tremendously dangerous. %$* 95

the human—what we’ve heard repeatedly from our opponents, is, extolling you not to try to draw distinctions, not to try to rule the rule of reason. %$* 95
against the motion, jack cloonan. %$* 92
i think honestly that we all on this stage tonight have learned something about each other and i think that we all want to get to the same position. %$* 98
i firmly believe that. %$* 98
i think that we have a different way of going about it. %$* 98
and we may differ in methodology. %$* 98
i believe on our side and our argument, and i’m not making this just based on moral grounds, i’m making this from the position of a utilitarian, practical application of what i know to work. %$* 98
and that because we have such a huge deficit in our ability to collect solid, good intelligence, i don’t want to waste the time trying to find that little dime i mentioned to you on the beach. %$* 98
we don’t have time to do that, the enemy as david suggested is very committed. %$* 98
bin laden has issued a fatwa and in that fatwa he has declared war on the united states and he has said it is the duty of every good muslim to kill americans. %$* 98
one— %$* 92
where do they find them. %$* 98
the question is, how am i going to protect you. %$* 98
how is our government going to protect you. %$* 98
and the best way to do that it seems to me, is what we’ve been advocating on this side. %$* 98
let’s be clear. %$* 98
stress can be defined any number of ways. %$* 98
what we’re talking about are extreme measures. %$* 98
and those extreme measures don’t work %$* 98
haven’t worked, and it sets us up for cataclysmic results, which means, as darius pointed out, revenge of the worst sort. %$* 98
and we haven’t seen the worst yet. %$* 98
we haven’t seen the repercussions of what abu ghraib has represented and others. %$* 98
trust me when i say that. %$* 98
i think honestly that we all on this stage tonight have learned something about each other and i think that we all want to get to the same position. %$* 98
i firmly believe that. %$* 98
i think that we have a different way of going about it. %$* 98
and we may differ in methodology. %$* 98
i believe on our side and our argument, and i’m not making this just based on moral grounds, i’m making this from the position of a utilitarian, practical application of what i know to work. %$* 98
and that because we have such a huge deficit in our ability to collect solid, good intelligence, i don’t want to waste the time trying to find that little dime i mentioned to you on the beach. %$* 98
we don’t have time to do that, the enemy as david suggested is very committed. %$* 98
bin laden has issued a fatwa and in that fatwa he has declared war on the united states and he has said it is the duty of every good muslim to kill americans. %$* 98
for the motion, rick francona. %$* 92
i was struck by your question, sir, and i really appreciate you asking that, about the moral ground, you know, do we lose by not adhering to the moral high ground. %$* 97
trust me, and i think all of us are on the same tier, no one wants to use these techniques as a matter of course. %$* 97
no one enjoys this, from those of us who have done this, it’s not a very pleasant experience. %$* 97
but we don’t live in a perfect world. %$* 97
we didn’t create that world, and it is inhabit by people who wanna kill us. %$* 97
and i’m not sure revenge is the factor it’s their stated goal in life, for whatever reason. %$* 97
is this utilitarian? %$* 97
yes. %$* 97
it’s the mission of, of the intelligence community and the armed forces to protect the country, through whatever means are—is legally possible. %$* 97
and when you’re lucky enough to get your hands on one of these suspects—and it’s very difficult to do, how do you find them. %$* 97
these are all very good points. %$* 97
once you get your hands on one, you have to be able to get the information you need. %$* 97
if the rapport-building works, great. %$* 97
if it doesn’t, you’ve gotta be able— %$* 97
one. %$* 92
—to ratchet it up, and get what you have to have. %$* 97
they can’t defeat us militarily, but i am not willing to risk the death of thousands of americans just on the moral high ground. %$* 97
i just, you can’t have it both ways. %$* 97
thank you all very much. %$* 92
now it’s time, now it’s time for you to decide who carried the day, once again, please pick up the keypad attached to the left armrest of your seat, after my prompt, press “1” if you are for the motion %$* 92
“tough interrogation of terror suspects is necessary.” “2” if you are against the motion, “3” if you are undecided, please cast your vote now. %$* 92
i want to thank the debaters and the audience for their good work. %$* 92
before i announce the results of the audience vote, i just want to take care of a couple of things. %$* 92
the next intelligence squared us debate will be on tuesday, april 15th, here at asia society and museum. %$* 92
the motion to be debated is, “islam is dominated by radicals.” it will be moderated by npr’s robert siegel, the panelists for the next debate are, for the motion, vice- president of research at the foundation for the defense of democracies, daveed gartenstein ross, senior fellow at the hudson institute, paul marshall, and former reporter for the wall street journal and visiting scholar at georgetown university, asra q.nomani. %$* 92
against the motion will be assistant professor at the university of california, riverside, and senior fellow at the usc center on public diplomacy, reza aslan, professor of history at columbia university richard bulliet, and edina lekovic, director of communications for the muslim public affairs council. %$* 92

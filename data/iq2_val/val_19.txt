hi. %$* 19
my name is cassandra. %$* 19
i wanted to ask about the effect of the revelations of these programs on our foreign policy. %$* 19
could you speak to that, please? %$* 19
that's another one where-- %$* 13
well, i'm not sure that that's relevant to the question of how we should feel about being spied on ourselves, so i'm going to pass on that question. %$* 13
i can take that. %$* 18
i know you can take it, but-- %$* 13
sir, right up there. %$* 13
hi. %$* 18
my name is jamie. %$* 18
it seems to me the central issue here is a reasonable suspicion. %$* 18
so my question is, is the massive surveillance that is being on debate here necessary to ascertain whether someone is a reasonable suspicion or not? %$* 18
let me try this one. %$* 118
stewart baker. %$* 13
there-- %$* 118
no one looks at these numbers without reasonable suspicion. %$* 118
that's the standard that is required by some of the safeguards, not all of them, but some of the safeguards that are already built into this program. %$* 118
and stewart, just to clarify, so that means the data's available, but nobody actually goes and looks at it. %$* 13
right. %$* 118
okay. %$* 13
that's right. %$* 118
so that was done quite consciously because everyone at nsa and in the government believed that the right answer was not to look at data without some reason to believe that the person that you're looking at is engaged in suspicious activity. %$* 118
the only difference between a standard law enforcement search and the searches we're talking about in the context of nsa is they gather the information first and put it in a database, but didn't search it without a reasonable suspicion. %$* 118
the reason that they gathered it first was because it was not practical to leave it where it was. %$* 118
they would not be able to do the searches in the time with the efficiency that they needed to use. %$* 118
would someone like to respond? %$* 13
so part-- %$* 121
michael german. %$* 13
part of it is that the harm comes from the initial collection, right? %$* 121
if we know-- %$* 121
and there's studies to show this-- %$* 121
if we know we're under surveillance, our behavior changes, right? %$* 121
every time that you're on google and you hesitate before you put that search term in or you hesitate to go to that website that does damage to the fabric of our society, to the idea that there's a marketplace of ideas-- %$* 121
so that original collection is a harm. %$* 121
but even with the limited number of searches, they go three hops. %$* 121
so it's the reasonable suspicious number but the people they called, the people they called, and the people they called. %$* 121
and then that-- %$* 121
it's like a big scoop that goes into this database, pulls out all those numbers which could rise into the millions-- %$* 121
pulls out 500 numbers. %$* 118
they put in 300, they brought out 500, and they gave 500 numbers to the fbi. they didn't bring out a great gob of data. %$* 118
they said they go three hops out, so if you only talked to two people, perhaps five-- %$* 121
no, they go to many places looking for suspicious numbers. %$* 118
when they find the suspicious numbers, they take it to the fbi. they only took 500 numbers to the fbi. %$* 118
i thought i saw a hand. %$* 13
that doesn't say how many numbers they looked at. %$* 120
that just says how many numbers they-- %$* 120
names attached, it was just-- %$* 118
the minimization standard says the numbers from the three hops go into the corporate store. %$* 121
the corporate store can be searched by anyone for any reason. %$* 121
if there's-- %$* 121
the minimization limits aren't on the corporate store. %$* 121
so it's like a big scoop that gets it, puts it in the store, that data can be used for a myriad purposes. %$* 121
we have time for one more question, so make it good. %$* 13
hi, my name is sue. %$* 19
and my question is for mr. %$* 19
baker. %$* 19
it seems at the heart of your argument is the sense of credible threat, that the public believe that there is a credible threat. %$* 19
but the government can't tell us what it is. %$* 19
they cannot reveal-- %$* 19
they can only say, "we've uncovered plots.” they can't tell us what they are. %$* 19
as a journalist, i've had the privilege of talking with numerous people who do counterterrorism and journalists who cover that. %$* 19
and they've looked me in the eye, and they said, "the threat is real.” and i believe that. %$* 19
so is your question, "should we-- %$* 13
but my question is in the wake of supposed wmds in iraq, why should the public believe the government? %$* 19
i think that's a fair question. %$* 118
and the real answer is you don't need to believe the government. %$* 118
sure, the government has access to particular threats. %$* 118
but it doesn't take a security clearance to know that there are a lot of people who would like nothing better than to kill everybody in this auditorium and would be delighted to have done it. %$* 118
we live-- %$* 118
that's the world we live in, and the technology that we all enjoy has empowered them. %$* 118
you couldn't have pulled off 9/11 30 years earlier. %$* 118
what i'm really suggesting is that having empowered everyone, and increasingly empowered people on the other side of the world who hate us, to cause serious damage here, we need to let the government use the technical tools that are created by lower cost for storing data to offset the advantage that the terrorists have. %$* 118
that's-- %$* 118
it seems to me you don't have to have a security clearance to have a commonsense appreciation of what the threat is and how empowered terrorists are these days. %$* 118
you had a good long run, and we're going to wrap up. %$* 13
i want to give you 15 seconds for a last word. %$* 13
michael german-- %$* 13
sure. %$* 121
for 15 seconds if you can do it. %$* 13
land this thing. %$* 13
so we can demand accountability from our intelligence agencies, and we need to because the only way they're going to be effective-- %$* 121
we didn't know how bad things were on september 10, 2001, were right? %$* 121
so what happened now is we have less knowledge of what the intelligence community is doing and how effective it's being. %$* 121
that can't work. %$* 121
we have to have transparency. %$* 121
that's how we get effective government. %$* 121
and that concludes round two of this intelligence squared u.s.debate where our motion is "spy on me, i would rather be safe." and here's where we are. %$* 13
we are about to hear brief closing statements from each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be two minutes, each. %$* 13
and remember how you voted before the debate, we're going to have you vote again immediately after these closing statements. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers have changed the most in percentage point terms of your vote will be declared our winner. %$* 13
on to round three, closing statements. %$* 13
our motion is "spy on me, i'd rather be safe.” and here to summarize his position against this motion, michael german. %$* 13
he's senior policy counsel for the american civil liberties union's washington legislative office. %$* 13
michael german, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 121
thank you very much for having me tonight, and thanks to stewart and richard for a great debate. %$* 121
let me close by talking about this problem from a different standpoint. %$* 121
i’m hopefully they only person in this room who’s actually been part of a terrorist conspiracy so i have a little bit of insight on what terrorists want. %$* 121
they want you to be afraid. %$* 121
they know they aren’t powerful enough to overthrow a government or popular enough to win an election. %$* 121
so their only tool is to use horrible violence to try to provoke a government into taking measures that damages itself. %$* 121
they know that when people are afraid they make bad decisions, they act irrationally, and their hope is that the government is going to overreact to the threat, right? %$* 121
they’re going to go after communities of suspicion rather than focusing on individuals who are meaning harm. %$* 121
one of the interesting things i found working in terrorist groups: they always have a manifesto, right? %$* 121
they create a clandestine organization and the first thing they do is tell everybody in the world who they are. %$* 121
from an undercover perspective, that’s bad policy, but the reason they do it is because they’re trying to provoke grievance so that-- %$* 121
they want to let the government know who to go after so that they start to build real grievance, and that’s what starts to undermine the government, when it starts losing its legitimacy by doing things that violate its own values. %$* 121
that’s why i think the founding fathers were so genius when they created a system that inoculated against this kind of reaction, right? %$* 121
it made sure that the government was accountable to the people and limited in the power that it could use, particularly in violating the civil rights of americans, and what they knew wasn’t that that was going to be a weak form of government, but that that would be the strongest government on earth. %$* 121
we don’t need to be afraid. %$* 121
we need to demand accountability and we don’t need to sacrifice privacy, especially for the illusion of secrecy. %$* 121
thank you, michael german. %$* 13
our motion is: spy on me, i’d rather be safe; and here to summarize his position supporting the motion, richard falkenrath, former deputy homeland security advisor. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, richard falkenrath. %$* 13
thank you, john, and thank you, david and michael, for an excellent discussion and debate. %$* 119
i hope the audience understands that neither stewart nor i are in favor of an unfettered, unchecked executive authority to commit domestic spying. %$* 119
that’s not what we’re arguing here. %$* 119
we understand that this is an incredibly difficult area of governance and requires tough oversight, the involvement of congress, and the involvement of the judiciary. %$* 119
so please understand that’s where we’re coming from. %$* 119
there is another side to this, aside from the legitimate interest in personal privacy that we all have, and it’s security. %$* 119
and this is, as i said in my opening, not abstract, and i’ll end with a brief anecdote. %$* 119
i was deputy commissioner of counterterrorism in new york city police department. %$* 119
we were part of the fbi joint terrorism task force. %$* 119
in september 2008, we learned of a case. %$* 119
we knew nothing about it until we were told as result of electronic surveillance there was an individual in denver developing a bomb and intending to transport it back to new york city for the purpose of attacking the new york city subway around, he thought, september 14, 15, or 16. we found out about that because of his electronic communication with his bomb-making trainer in pakistan. %$* 119
he drove across the country, fbi surveillance team in denver acquired him and began surveilling him in the course of his drive across the country with one to two kilograms of tatp explosive in his trunk. %$* 119
we began an investigation of his contact, who he was in telephonic communication with. %$* 119
as a result of that, dozens of people he was in communication with were identified. %$* 119
quickly, his two key co-conspirators, and then subject to much higher levels of intrusion-- %$* 119
of intrusive investigation. %$* 119
this was a real plot against the city of new york, where i was at the nypd, and it was stopped not entirely, but in large measure because of the techniques we were talking about here tonight. %$* 119
this is not abstract. %$* 119
there is another side to this, and it something which is very, very valuable. %$* 119
thank you, richard falkenrath. %$* 13
our motion: spy on me, i’d rather be safe; and here summarizing his position against this motion, david cole, a professor at georgetown university law center. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, david cole. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 120
technology has changed the calculus of surveillance in a dramatic way. %$* 120
it used to be if the government wanted to find out everything about who you hung out with, what books you read, who you were talking to, what you thought, it was very difficult, very costly for it to do so, and that was a check on the government’s ability to invade our privacy. %$* 120
that check has gone out the window because of the-- %$* 120
because of al gore and the internet. %$* 120
we now-- %$* 120
it's now possible to learn everything about us through this third party information which richard falkenrath says we shouldn't be concerned about at all. %$* 120
i think we need to be concerned about it. %$* 120
i think we can strike a proper balance between the technology that makes it possible for this kind of very, very broad surveillance and the need to find bad guys. %$* 120
but we can't do so if the programs are run in secret, if the nsa is lying to us about it, and if we haven't had an opportunity to have a democratic deliberation. %$* 120
and when we don't have that democratic deliberation, it seems to me it's very likely that the security people are going to go overboard on the side of security. %$* 120
and when they're collecting texts, they're collecting data on every text that i send to my high school daughter when i go to pick her up from school, and she hasn't come out, and i say, "where are you? %$* 120
i'm here. %$* 120
where are you? %$* 120
i'm here. %$* 120
where are you? %$* 120
i'm here.” why does the nsa need to know that information? %$* 120
the only reason that they have access to that information is because they did it in secret because if they had done it in public and told us they wanted to gather that information to keep us safe, i think we would have said no. %$* 120
and you should say no. %$* 120
thank you, david cole. %$* 13
our motion, "spy on me, i'd rather be safe," and here to summarize his position in support of this motion, stewart baker, the first assistant secretary for policy at the department of homeland security. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, stewart baker. %$* 13
thanks, john. %$* 118
you know, when i started as general counsel of the national security agency, janet reno, the attorney general, came out for a visit. %$* 118
and this was a high- stakes meeting. %$* 118
she was deeply skeptical about whether this spy agency could be trusted at all, whether it understood what the fourth amendment was. %$* 118
and we were walking through an operations center with her when the director stopped, looked at a corporal who was going over some intercepts, and he said to the corporal, "stand up, sir.” and "what do you do if you find a communication by an american? %$* 118
" that corporal plucked out of a mass of people doing the intercepts, said, "sir, we segregate that. %$* 118
we cannot disseminate it unless there's foreign intelligence in it.”we must take the-- %$* 118
we must anonymize the data and destroy it if there's no intelligence in it," which was the rule. %$* 118
and i thought to myself, you know, the first rule of lawyering is don't ask a question if you don't know what the answer's going to be. %$* 118
but the director was absolutely sure that you could pick anybody out of that agency and ask him what the rules were. %$* 118
he would tell you and would be proud of the fact that he knew them and would obey them. %$* 118
that is the culture of the national security agency. %$* 118
if you give them the rules, they will follow those rules. %$* 118
they have-- %$* 118
we have given them rules in this context. %$* 118
they are subject to lots of constraints. %$* 118
we cannot say, "all of this public, or we might as well not try to gather intelligence.” we have to set rules, we have to count on people to enforce them, and then we have to count on the goodwill of our agencies to carry them out because that's our only hope of being able to do intelligence under law. %$* 118
i think we can do it. %$* 118
thank you, stewart baker. %$* 13
and that concludes closing statements. %$* 13
and now it's time to learn which side you feel has argued the best here. %$* 13
we're going to ask you again to go to the keypad at your seat and press keys number one, two or three. %$* 13
remember, the motion is this: spy on me, i would rather be safe. %$* 13
if you agree with this team that's arguing for the motion, push number one. %$* 13
if you agree with their opponents, this team, push number two. %$* 13
and if you became or remain undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and you can ignore the other keys. %$* 13
they're not live. %$* 13
and if you make a mistake, just correct it, and the system will lock in your final result, and we're going to lock this out in about 15 seconds, and then we need about two minutes to calculate the results for you. %$* 13
so while that's being done, one thing i want to say is i've been exchanging glances with our executive producer who sits in the front row. %$* 13
and the thumbs-up came up about halfway through. %$* 13
i think this is one of the best debates that we've ever had in terms of not only the material that the teammates-- %$* 13
that the opponents and teammates brought to the table, but also the spirit in which this was conducted and the respect, and the-- %$* 13
our favorite word-- %$* 13
the intelligence of it. %$* 13
so i just want to invite a round of applause for all of them. %$* 13
i also-- %$* 13
i also want to congratulate everyone who asked a question, and that includes the questions that i passed on. %$* 13
there was nothing wrong with any of them. %$* 13
this is the kind of thing that really makes you think, and your brain starts going, and i think in fact a couple of the questions that i turned down in themselves would make excellent topics for debate. %$* 13
so everybody who put their hands up and those who got up to ask questions, i want to thank you as well for doing that. %$* 13
as we said at the beginning, we would love to have you tweet about this debate. %$* 13
you can use the twitter handle at iq2us.that's us. %$* 13
the hash tag is spydebate. %$* 13
our next debate will be in new york city on wednesday, december 4, if you can get up there for that. %$* 13
and i happen to know that there are some of our new york audience members who came down for this debate. %$* 13
so you've got to copy that and go up to new york. %$* 13
the topic on december 4 will be "don't eat anything with a face." for the motion, dr. %$* 13
neal barnard, he is a clinical researcher who studies the effects of diet on health. %$* 13
also for the motion, gene baur, he is president and cofounder of farm sanctuary. %$* 13
time magazine called him the "conscience of the food movement." against the motion, chris masterjohn, who is a nutritional sciences researcher, and he's the aproponent of the paleo diet, and joel salatin, who is a third generation alternative farmer. %$* 13
a limited number of tickets are still available for that one on our website, www.iq2us.org. %$* 13
the mccain institute is holding another debate right here in the burke theater on thursday, december 5. they are debating this question, "drone wars, are we going too far? %$* 13
"to reserve a ticket for that, go to their website, mccaininstitute.org. %$* 13
and for people who couldn't join our live audience, there are a lot of ways to catch these debates, going forward, at iq2us.org and on fora.tv, and the mccain institute debates can be seen on their site as well. %$* 13
and we would love to have you listen to all of our debates on npr stations across the country. %$* 13
we'll almost definitely be broadcast here in washington on wamu, so tune in when that happens, and you can listen to your applause. %$* 13
and we're hoping to make it back to washington again next year, so go to our website for up-to- date information on that. %$* 13
and before i announce the final results, i want one more time to turn the lectern over to ambassador kurt volker. %$* 13
well, first off, let me say that these are issues that are in the news every day, that you hear about them all the time, but i do think this was the most serious, informed, respectful, and insightful discussion of these issues that i've ever heard. %$* 117
and i want to hear do you agree with that? %$* 117
and one of the reasons that, that is true is because of the person who has not yet been thanked, wonderful moderator, john donvan. %$* 117
oh, thank you. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
on behalf of the mccain institute i want to say thank you, and we've loved this partnership with intelligence squared. %$* 117
and we look forward to seeing you, as john announced, here in this room december 5, 5:00, on "drone policy, are we going too far? %$* 117
" john? %$* 117
thank you, kurt. %$* 13
all right, so i-- %$* 13
it's all in now. %$* 13
i have the results. %$* 13
remember, we have you vote twice, once before the debate and once again after the debate. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers have moved the most in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. %$* 13
our motion is this, "spy on me, i would rather be safe." the initial vote, before hearing the arguments 26 percent of you agreed with this motion, 41 percent were against it, and 33 percent were undecided. %$* 13
so those are the first results. %$* 13
remember, you need to move the most in percentage point terms to win this game. %$* 13
here is the second vote. %$* 13
the team arguing for the motion, their second vote is 29 percent. %$* 13
they went from 26 percent to 29 percent. %$* 13
that's a 3 percent increase. %$* 13
that's the number to beat. %$* 13
let's see the team against the vote. %$* 13
they were 41 percent to start. %$* 13
they were 62 percent at the end. %$* 13
they clearly beat that 3 percent. %$* 13
they are our winner. %$* 13
our congratulations to them. %$* 13
the motion "spy on me, i'd rather be safe," the team arguing for that has lost. %$* 13
the team arguing against it has won. %$* 13
thank you from me, john donvan, and intelligence squared u.s. we'll see you next time. %$* 13

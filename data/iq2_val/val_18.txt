yes, absolutely. %$* 118
all right, so let me take that to the other side. %$* 13
they’re arguing that in fact while the data is there, that there are built in safeguards, and those things are for real. %$* 13
you know, there’s a process through which governments need to go in-- %$* 13
or that the government needs to know to go in order to dig more deeply into that pile of data, but michael german, do you trust in the safeguards? %$* 13
or what is your response to their basic argument that maybe it’s not so nice, but it’s safe? %$* 13
well, i guess the easy two-word response would be edward snowden, right? %$* 121
if this data and all this stuff was so protected and so well regulated and so controlled, how would edward snowden have gotten so much access to it? %$* 121
and luckily, because edward snowden did get so much access to it, and because we’re still benefiting even this week from information that’s coming forward, what has become clearer and clearer is that the fisa court was being-- %$* 121
that the nsa was misrepresenting the program, i’ll say that in the nicest way. %$* 121
and continually going beyond the scope of the minimization procedures and rules to the extent that in 2011, judge bates said it was unconstitutional %$* 121
bottom line, then, are you saying that you don't trust the system? %$* 13
i don't trust any system that doesn't have effective public oversight. %$* 121
richard falkenrath. %$* 13
it's worth-- %$* 119
there's a few things that \-- %$* 119
neither do stewart or i.we think it's effective in this case. %$* 119
and you’ve left out a few facts. %$* 119
so this program, the one that draws your ire so strongly, the bulk acquisition of telephone call records. %$* 119
first point: the supreme court has held, since the late '70s, that this data, like what number called what number at what time for how long is not privacy information. %$* 119
getting it from the government is not a search. %$* 119
now, professor cole and his scholarship on this is against that and thinks the supreme court got it wrong. %$* 119
nonetheless, the supreme court, for 35 years, has held this consistently. %$* 119
second, going beyond what is strictly necessary from what the supreme court says, the congress has authorized this provision. %$* 119
it's called section 215.it was in the patriot act. %$* 119
it amended the fisa court regulation. %$* 119
people on your side of this debate were against it then, and you're still against it now. %$* 119
215 was very controversial then. %$* 119
it's still controversial now among the same people. %$* 119
but finally, you leave out the fact that this program, the bulk acquisition of telephone call records for narrow counterterrorism purposes has been authorized 34 times by 14 different federal judges, who wrote, in writing, they said they would not have authorized it but for the safeguards in place. %$* 119
and every 90 days, they have to do it again. %$* 119
all right. %$* 13
let's let david cole respond. %$* 13
well-- %$* 120
your opponents are saying it's credible. %$* 13
what's that-- %$* 120
the first-- %$* 120
your opponents are saying the safeguards are very credible. %$* 13
the first thing i'd say is i'm not sure we would be satisfied even if the safeguards were fully credible and followed in every instance. %$* 120
suppose the government said, "we're going to put a video camera in each one of your bedrooms. %$* 120
we're going to collect the data from what happens in your bedroom, but we're not going to look at it until we have a really good reason to look at it. %$* 120
would we say, "okay, that's fine. %$* 120
go ahead. %$* 120
put the video camera in every one of our-- %$* 120
" so back end safeguards don't answer all of the concerns. %$* 120
to richard's point about the notion that this information is not protected-- %$* 120
we don't have a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to this information. %$* 120
mike hayden has said, if they can get all the-- %$* 120
just remind people of who mike hayden is. %$* 13
mike hayden, the former head of nsa, cia, has said, “if i can get all of that phone data about who you've called over a period of time, i don't need to listen to what you're saying. %$* 120
i can get such a portrait of who you are that i don't even need the content. %$* 120
this stuff is more private than the content itself.” %$* 120
david, but i don't think that i-- %$* 13
i directly heard an answer or an articulated answer to why you don't trust the safeguards that-- %$* 13
you said they're not credible after richard actually made a pretty good point that the supreme court has time and again and legislation-- %$* 13
why don't you find them credible? %$* 13
well, first of all, richard's point about the supreme court was-- %$* 120
supreme court has not found that the safeguards are credible here. %$* 120
what the supreme court found was that in the '70s, before al gore invented the internet-- %$* 120
it found that when you make these phone calls, you don't have an expectation of privacy with respect to the data regarding who you called and how long you called for. %$* 120
immediately congress responded and said, yes, we do have an expectation of privacy. %$* 120
and they passed a law that forbade the government from getting it without individualized suspicion. %$* 120
this law, the government has now turned around and perverted, in secret, to get the very information that congress originally said we shouldn't get, and to get not just the data with respect to one suspect, which is what was at issue in the supreme court case in the '70s, but to get every piece of phone data of every one of us every time we make a call. %$* 120
richard falkenrath. %$* 13
let me try to put this in terms everyone can understand the utility of this. %$* 119
so professor cole, mike german, stewart baker, john, we're here at the same place, same time, participating in a complex operation. %$* 119
i, in fact, never had a phone call with david cole or-- %$* 119
nonetheless we're here, doing something relatively complicated. %$* 119
now, it turns out-- %$* 119
you mean putting on this show. %$* 13
yes. %$* 119
we talked to another person. %$* 119
you have no idea how complicated it is. %$* 13
we talked to another person, who is in the audience, and was the coordinator of this. %$* 119
and now, here's-- %$* 119
do you understand why this data matters and why mike hayden would say that we want this information where you have no expectation of right to privacy. %$* 119
we talked to the coordinator of this debate, who then put us together, right? %$* 119
that is how plots are unraveled. %$* 119
they find out about one perp. %$* 119
they look at the communications pattern, they identify the network, and they can diffuse the plot. %$* 119
so imagine this was not a debate but a bombing. %$* 119
this is how-- %$* 119
this call record data is how it gets unraveled and stopped. %$* 119
and it's why it matters. %$* 119
and it's not a video camera in the bedroom. %$* 119
that is-- %$* 119
that is not a fair comparison, and i think you know it. %$* 119
this data, for very good reasons, the government and the congress and the court do not hold that you have the same expectations of the right to privacy as to you do in your bedroom. %$* 119
let me bring in michael german and move the topic a little bit to the issue of practicality, because michael, you made the case in your opening statement against this motion, "spy on me, i'd rather be safe.” you made the case that the flood of data is actually-- %$* 13
it's overload, that it can't be used. %$* 13
and yet we heard stewart baker, your opponent, get up and go through a number of cases that he worked where in fact he has-- %$* 13
he clearly argued that the availability of the data after crimes were committed helped track down-- %$* 13
put together how the plot was put together and make some pretty decent arrests. %$* 13
so there's no doubt the fbi has tremendous investigative skills that can be put to place once you know something bad has happened. %$* 121
and i've seen that done on a personal basis. %$* 121
but what we're talking about-- %$* 121
first of all, it was sold as a preventive measure. %$* 121
this is for preventing terrorism, to the for solving a terrorist bombing. %$* 121
so you know, i think that the analysts at the nctc really say it all. %$* 121
so another i was going to quote. %$* 121
"there are so many databases, people don't even know what buttons to push. %$* 121
they don't know where to get information, or they may even already have it and not know it.” another said, "more information isn't necessarily better. %$* 121
better information is better.” so that's what we have to focus on, how-- %$* 121
how do we let law enforcement have the tools it needs to get the bad guys without impacting the rights of the rest of us? %$* 121
and i think the founders did a pretty good job of setting up a system based on reasonable suspicion and probable cause. %$* 121
but does that mean you're just dismissing the achievements that your opponent laid out, where in fact the data was used to-- %$* 13
again, there's no transparency. %$* 121
there have been these cases that they say these were solved with this program-- %$* 121
so you you're telling me we don't know whether he's telling the truth. %$* 13
right. %$* 121
because-- %$* 121
not that you're-- %$* 13
and i want to make clear-- %$* 13
no, no. %$* 121
that you're not calling-- %$* 13
accusing him of dishonesty. %$* 13
what i'm saying is there's no check to know whether the story is true or not. %$* 13
and it's also worth noting that stewart did not say that the nsa data mining program solved any of these. %$* 120
what he said was the passenger data program. %$* 120
when the nsa was asked, point blank, by congress, and by a friendly member of congress, can you tell us some terrorist plots that you've stopped by virtue of the nsa data mining program? %$* 120
the call data program, he said, "yes, one.” and it was the one that mike referred to earlier. %$* 120
it was about an $8,000 transmission. %$* 120
and the member of congress who was friendly to this, to the program, said, wait a minute, you have cases of violence, right, that you stop, not just transfer of money. %$* 120
and the nsa guy had to say, all right, actually, no. %$* 120
stewart baker, we've been quoting for quite a few minutes here without letting you speak, so it's-- %$* 13
it's your turn. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 118
i-- %$* 118
i have to say, there's a little confusion here. %$* 118
i hear mike german saying, you know, all of these data collection programs are bad. %$* 118
and i think i hear professor cole saying, oh, no, those are all-- %$* 118
spying on us is fine if you're gathering data about travel reservations or border crossings. %$* 118
all of that data isn't the kind of spying on us that we're opposed to. %$* 118
we're opposed to this one program that relates to nsa. %$* 118
and i think that suggests that they really don't have the courage of their convictions, that information that is available to third parties should be used for security purposes. %$* 118
that's the position that we are arguing here. %$* 118
and i think we've done a good job. %$* 118
on the question of whether nsa and its program responds to a very real problem, let's remember how they got started with this program. %$* 118
in the months before 9/11, nsa was listening to communications in yemen, and they heard calls from an al-qaeda operative. %$* 118
what they didn't know is that the al-qaeda operative was planning the hijacking in the united states. %$* 118
and those calls were coming from inside the united states, because they had no way to look inside the united states to see where these calls were coming from. %$* 118
if they had known months before the attack that somebody was inside the united states at that high rank within al-qaeda, there would have been an all-points bulletin for that person. %$* 118
they would have found him, and probably the attack would not have occurred. %$* 118
when you have a failure like that, you ask, what can we do to make sure that never happens again? %$* 118
and this program responds in part to that concern. %$* 118
and i think that's a lesson that is written in blood for the national security agency. %$* 118
michael german. %$* 13
again, the public record disputes that. %$* 121
the cia did know he was in the united states. %$* 121
but the cia wasn't talking to the nsa or the fbi or customs is a totally different issue than whether they needed to collect the information. %$* 121
there were people in our intelligence community in both the cia and nsa who knew they were in the united states. %$* 121
a few people here and there, but the nsa did not know because they had no tools to know it, to say, "well, if somebody else had done their job perfectly, you wouldn't have needed this program," is to say, you know, "if the world were perfect, we wouldn't need counterterrorism." %$* 118
but you have to fix the problem that exists, not create a new problem by gathering data you don't need. %$* 121
i'm going to come to the audience for questions in just a moment. %$* 13
and, again, i want to remind you if you raise your hand, a microphone will be brought from the side aisle, just hang for a second till the microphone reaches you. %$* 13
and then we'd appreciate it if you could stand up, and tell us at least your first name. %$* 13
and then to really shoot a question at these guys, and really make it really focused as a question. %$* 13
in fact, why don't we go to that since i've got some hands up already. %$* 13
sir, why don't you-- %$* 13
right down in front mike can be brought down here. %$* 13
i was thinking in the very center, thanks. %$* 13
hi, my name is michael. %$* 18
is there an alternative implementable replacement to these data collection programs to keep us safe? %$* 18
i think there is. %$* 120
i think-- %$* 120
david cole. %$* 13
the framers came up with an alternative. %$* 120
it's an alternative that we used for 200+ years. %$* 120
and the alternative says that you respect people's privacy until you have reason to believe that they're engaged in some sort of wrongdoing or that they have some sort of foreign intelligence that you want to get. %$* 120
and the-- %$* 120
but the point is it's individualized suspicion, and once you develop that, then you can tap their phone, then you can search their homes, then you can invade their privacy. %$* 120
what the fourth amendment was designed to stop was dragnet surveillance, general search warrants that gave the government the power to just pick up everybody's information in the hope that they'd find a bad guy. %$* 120
yeah, it's quite possible that they'll find a bad guy if they pick up everybody's information, but the framers said, "that's not the way we want to strike the balance between liberty and security because that gives up all of our privacy in the hope that it'll make us more secure. %$* 120
and i-- %$* 120
so i think we should stick with the way we've been doing it for 200 years and not let technology and the internet push us towards dragnet surveillance. %$* 120
we have-- %$* 119
richard falkenrath. %$* 13
we have, in fact, stuck with that for information the supreme court deems personal privacy information. %$* 119
we just don't for this category of information which you think should be categorized but the rest of the legal system in the united states doesn't. %$* 119
well, but that's actually the problem so if that's-- %$* 120
your standard still applies to content, right? %$* 119
it still requires particularized approval to get the content. %$* 119
what we're talking about here is information which you or whoever have given to a third party, namely, a telecommunications provider, and that they have in their system to use for their purposes and, as stewart explained, the government needs for its purposes from time to time. %$* 119
so you're confusing the discussion by suggesting they're the same. %$* 119
these are different categories of information. %$* 119
and while you disagree with how the supreme court has ruled this, the entire system is built around this distinction. %$* 119
well, two points on that. %$* 120
first of all-- %$* 120
david cole. %$* 13
i'm not the only one who says that this information is-- %$* 120
gives all kinds of private information. %$* 120
mike hayden has said that it's more valuable than the content itself in terms of determining what someone's doing. %$* 120
that's number one. %$* 120
number two, the supreme court has actually, in its most recent decision on whether the fourth amendment covers gps monitoring of a car in public, said, "absolutely, it does.” and five justices said-- %$* 120
because it involved an invasion of a property right-- %$* 120
but five justices said, "because collecting all that information, even though it's in public, about where you go-- %$* 120
" they were collecting where this guy went 24/7 for a month-- %$* 120
and all nine justices said, "that's an invasion of privacy, that requires fourth amendment protection," rejecting the very position that rich falkenrath is putting forward, that, "well, if it's in public, there is no expectation of privacy," or, "if you share it with a third party, there is no expectation of privacy.” the reality is that everything we do today is shared with a third party. %$* 120
every time you walk anywhere with your phone, you're telling the phone company where you are. %$* 120
should the government be able to get that without any individualized suspicion? %$* 120
and i don't-- %$* 118
can i-- %$* 118
stewart baker. %$* 13
a point where i think we do agree, of course the government should wherever possible be put to reasonable suspicion before it looks into individual activities. %$* 118
that is true even of the nsa program which is the one that you have chosen as the poster child for this issue. %$* 118
no one is allowed to search this data without a reasonable articulable suspicion. %$* 118
so the question really boils down to "are you allowed to collect it first and put it in the database? %$* 118
" and, look, the question i thought was an excellent one, "why would you do that if there's an alternative? %$* 118
" and the problem is there's not a good alternative. %$* 118
the alternative would be to leave it with the companies and search it there when we have some reason to be concerned about that individual phone number, but the companies get rid of that data on their own schedule. %$* 118
they’ve got no obligation to keep it, and they don’t. %$* 118
second, there are-- %$* 118
we got rid of ma bell. %$* 118
there is no one phone company you can go to search. %$* 118
no one computer system. %$* 118
so you would have to try to do this kind of analysis of who’s talking to whom outside the united states and in-- %$* 118
you’d have to go jumping from system to system to system to system. %$* 118
it’s a nightmare. %$* 118
if you thought the healthcare.gov was bad, building this system would be worse. %$* 118
we-- %$* 13
we are in the question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i’m john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two against two, arguing it out over this motion: spy on me, i’d rather be safe. %$* 13
let’s go back to questions. %$* 13
sir, right there. %$* 13
orange necktie. %$* 13
yeah, if you’ll stand up, they’ll find you with the microphone. %$* 13
i’m obviously tending to favor the middle, because you’re right in front of my vision and the whole microphone thing would be a lot easier at the edges. %$* 13
making it hard for the mic runner. %$* 118
yeah. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13
i’m going to go to the edges next time. %$* 13
you need a microphone. %$* 19
the radio wouldn’t hear you. %$* 13
all right. %$* 18
sure. %$* 18
hi, my name is afar and my question to the proponents of this motion is that the government is spying on me, you too, and everyone in this room, and if it were to know then did not expose these programs, how would i know and you would know that the government is spying on us, whether it’s legal or illegal? %$* 18
richard falkenrath. %$* 13
it’s a lot of different things, and so i think we’re probably going to refer back to this telephone metadata question, and in that case, it’s true that the scale of it was classified, but it was disclosed to every member of congress in writing twice, 2009 and 2011, where the administration-- %$* 119
the department of justice-- %$* 119
by the way, the obama department of justice-- %$* 119
wrote that this program, which we need you to reauthorize, which they did, broad bipartisan majorities, will entail the collection of substantially every telephone call record in the country. %$* 119
so they were told. %$* 119
now whether-- %$* 119
congress knew. %$* 13
yeah, so congress-- %$* 119
and they kept it secret. %$* 13
and if they didn’t-- %$* 119
and they kept it secret-- %$* 119
it wasn’t being hidden from them at that stage. %$* 119
you can make an argument about an earlier program up to 2006, but for that program in writing they were told. %$* 119
response from the other side? %$* 13
you don’t necessarily have to-- %$* 13
again, when ron wyden asked james clapper at a hearing, “are you collecting data on millions of americans? %$* 120
” he flatly said “no, we’re not.” that he’s talking to congress, he’s talking on the record, he’s talking to cspan, he’s talking to the american people. %$* 120
they are lying to us. %$* 120
and members of congress, members in the house have complained that the house intelligence committee will not give them access to records. %$* 121
you know, the exceptive classification on these programs makes it so that only the member can see it, not the staff who actually have the time to work on these programs, to understand the legality, so it’s not as easy as it looks. %$* 121
so, go ahead, yes? %$* 13
i was around for the creation of the legal structure around intelligence, and it was a remarkable achievement for the united states. %$* 118
no other country thought you could do intelligence under law. %$* 118
we set up a program that was designed to prevent the abuses that had occurred in the 60s and 70s, and by and large it has done it. %$* 118
but everyone knows-- %$* 118
everyone here knows you can’t do intelligence in the open because the people you’re trying gather it on will be watching more closely than anyone else to figure out how to defeat it. %$* 118
at some point you have to say, i’ve got to trust somebody. %$* 118
in this case we are trusting 14 judges, two different administrations, committees headed by different parties over almost a decade. %$* 118
at some point, you have to say, yes, i would love it if i could know about this, but i realize that everything i know about al qaeda knows about, and i have to trust somebody. %$* 118
if i’m going to trust both parties and all three branches of government, that’s probably as good as it’s going to get. %$* 118
and let me just challenge the idea that this is kept secret so that the terrorist doesn’t know that they’re doing this, because i worked and met a lot of terrorists working with them and every single of them and every single criminal i worked undercover against knew they were-- %$* 121
that they were a terrorist or a criminal. %$* 121
so they knew that there was probable cause to believe that they were a terrorist and criminal, and yet they knew that the fourth amendment existed. %$* 121
so they don’t worry about suspicion-less collection, because they know they can get caught up in reasonable suspicion collection, probably cause, proof beyond a reasonable doubt suspicion, right? %$* 121
so this was secret to keep it from us. %$* 121
so we wouldn’t know we were being spied on. %$* 121
i think you have to address the fact that jim sensenbrenner, the leading republican on the judiciary committee who wrote section 215, he says "this program is beyond anything that i would have ever dreamed of authorizing.” and how can that be if he was read into the program and-- %$* 120
is he lying to us? %$* 120
okay. %$* 13
right down in front. %$* 13
i think one of the more compelling arguments against the proposition is that it's just not practical. %$* 19
there is-- %$* 19
there is billions of numbers being collected all the time. %$* 19
and both of y'all seem to have a very extensive experience in this field. %$* 19
do you find that it is actually impractical, that agents are being completely overwhelmed by the numbers they're seeing every day and not at the higher levels, but down, the folks who are actually doing the collection and %$* 19
i'll try that. %$* 118
there is always a risk that you will be overwhelmed by data. %$* 118
90 percent of the data in the world was created in the last two years, apparently. %$* 118
i think that's about 40 percent my kids' facebook postings. %$* 118
but in fact, the tools for analyzing that are also pretty good. %$* 118
and no one at nsa said, we cannot keep up with this data. %$* 118
once you've put it in a proper framework, they were only doing, after all, 300 identifier searches in a year. %$* 118
it was not a problem doing those searches. %$* 118
it was not a problem collecting and putting the data into a database. %$* 118
there may be times when an ordinary agent says, "i've got too much data," but in this program and in the program i talked about earlier, with travel data, the computer systems allowed us to use it very effectively. %$* 118
i want to-- %$* 13
that was kind of michael german's opening point, that there is too much. %$* 13
so i'd like to hear your response to stewart's response to that. %$* 13
well, one of the major controversial programs was a similar program collecting internet data that ran. %$* 121
that was the whole hospital room confrontation with attorney general-- %$* 121
ashcroft. %$* 18
ashcroft. %$* 121
i'm sorry. %$* 121
and they ended that program in 2011 because they found that it wasn't actually very effective. %$* 121
so for ten years, they collected our records, and it took them that long to decide they weren't actually very useful. %$* 121
ma'am, you just had your hand up. %$* 13
right behind you, sir. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 19
my name is shelly. %$* 19
and i'd like to talk to the point-- %$* 19
ask the question about the point of what data mining means to our privacy and our safety. %$* 19
i have to admit that whenever i hear a government person say, "trust me, "i get very skeptical about what they're doing. %$* 19
we have a long history in this country-- %$* 19
okay. %$* 13
i'm going to stop you there because i would rather let them make the speeches. %$* 13
but your question is good, and when i-- %$* 13
and it feels like a big softball to this side. %$* 13
but-- %$* 13
but i think it's worth getting some more detail about the way in which-- %$* 13
that you-- %$* 13
you know, you proposed something that's not happening, the tv camera in the bedroom. %$* 13
but let's say that data mining is happening. %$* 13
and what are actually the risks to privacy, aside from the kind of creepy feeling that you described having, that it can be done? %$* 13
what are the actual risks in the implementation? %$* 13
and i'll let david cole take that. %$* 13
well, the risks are that with all of the-- %$* 120
i mean, the same logic that gave them access to the phone records would give them access to your email records, to your internet records, to your credit card records, to your bank records, to your phone location data. %$* 120
and the danger is you put all that information together, and they can determine everything about us. %$* 120
they can know more about us than our closest friends know, than our spouses know. %$* 120
and the only thing that-- %$* 120
if you give them all that data, then the only thing that's stopping them from doing that are these so-called backend safeguards which were routinely violated by the nsa and which we've-- %$* 120
we didn't have any opportunity to debate as to whether they were adequate or not because they were put in place entirely in secret. %$* 120
richard falkenrath. %$* 13
the "they" that you just described, "they can put all this together, they can understand-- %$* 119
the government. %$* 120
yeah. %$* 119
it sounds a lot more like google than the government because-- %$* 119
and you have to take this-- %$* 119
this is actually a serious point. %$* 119
this is not the case that the government is tracking everything you do and can put it all together. %$* 119
and the government doesn't care what you're doing. %$* 119
they're actually, though, in the last 10 years, with the explosion of social media and the explosion of terms of service agreement and informed consent that no one reads, is-- %$* 119
what you just described emerging in the private sector, with a legal basis being a document which no one can really read and give informed consent to; unlike the program we're talking about, which is subject to extreme safeguards, rooted in the constitution, backed up by both chambers of congress and by the judiciary. %$* 119
and so i think you've really got to shift your terms of your argument here. %$* 119
this isn't the '70s with the fbi running around at the behest of richard nixon probing into people's lives. %$* 119
this is a world where the government is tightly regulated and overseen in a way subject to law. %$* 119
and it's the private sector, if anything, which is emerging as the "they" in your scary scenario. %$* 119
well, the fact that the private sector may-- %$* 120
may threaten our privacy is not a justification to allow the government to invade our privacy, for two reasons. %$* 120
one, we can establish limits on private sector. %$* 120
but two, for the reasons i suggested earlier, there are lots more reasons to be concerned about the government having access to this information than the private sector having it. %$* 120
and that's reflected in our constitution, which constitutionally limits government access to data, does not constitutionally limit private access to data. %$* 120
there's a reason for that. %$* 120
and it's a good reason. %$* 120
i want to point out, tonight's debate is being broadcast worldwide on our website, iq2us.org and on fora.tv. %$* 13
it's also being seen on arizona state on live stream. %$* 13
and i'm just saying that because in the time we have left, if you're watching it and would like to join in the audience participation question, you can try sending us a tweet on it. %$* 13
and if we can pick it up in time, our hash tag is "spy debate.” and we'll try to work it into the debate. %$* 13
if you send that tweet, the nsa will know that you have-- %$* 13
they already know. %$* 18
so think carefully. %$* 13
another question, right up there. %$* 13
hi. %$* 19
my name is kadeeja i was going to say, if the nsa wanted to be safer, why did they lie to congress about spying on us? %$* 19
stewart baker. %$* 13
i'm-- %$* 118
well, really, the question is-- %$* 13
really, i think the question is, should we be troubled that the nsa is accused of having been dishonest? %$* 13
i don't want to defend what the dni said there. %$* 118
he was, as far as i can tell, surprised by the question and made an error in his answer. %$* 118
but, no, i'm sorry. %$* 118
how could he have said, i'm going to lie people after having gone out and said, "i want everybody to understand this program.” that's-- %$* 118
it's quite clear that he had set up and agreed to provide this information to everyone. %$* 118
and so i don't think that we should be saying that there is a-- %$* 118
there's intentional lie being undertaken in that context. %$* 118
other side want to respond? %$* 13
michael german. %$* 13
and it was an unintentional lie? %$* 120
at that time, nobody knew about this program. %$* 120
we didn't know. %$* 120
edward snowden hadn't stolen the information. %$* 120
he was asked, point blank-- %$* 120
this information was provided to everybody in congress. %$* 118
everybody in-- %$* 120
a letter was written that we-- %$* 120
you're assuming every member of congress-- %$* 120
every member of congress-- %$* 120
you know, i want to move on because-- %$* 13
reads every letter that's sent to %$* 120
i think the side argument on what he-- %$* 13
let me just clarify. %$* 18
said will not help the audience vote on the motion so i'd like to move on. %$* 13
but senator wyden did come out and say that he had given the question 24 hours in advance. %$* 121
okay. %$* 13
right up here. %$* 13
if you can stand, please. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13

okay, all of our preliminaries are out of the way, at this point, we’re going to begin the evening and it’s pleasure to introduce, to set the stage and set the theme, the chairman of intelligence squared, mr. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
thank you very much and welcome. %$* 1
well, it’s my role in these evenings to frame the debate, and i think for most new yorkers, we’re all very familiar with the liberal critique of george w.bush. %$* 1
but even from a conservative perspective, the bush presidency could be seen as far worse than than bill clinton’s. %$* 1
clinton was for free trade, he spent a lot of political capital getting nafta through, versus the bush administration with steel tariffs and ethanol subsidies. %$* 1
clinton had welfare reform. %$* 1
this administration has had the first new entitlement of great scale in the last 40 years in prescription drugs for the elderly. %$* 1
clinton had a balanced budget. %$* 1
this administration has had absolutely out of control public spending. %$* 1
on the other hand, consider the following. %$* 1
this administration accomplished something that nobody would’ve thought possible—they kept america safe after 9-11. and then think about a president like nixon who was so reviled in his time, but whose rapprochement with china really set the stage, geopolitically for everything that transpired, the collapse of the soviet union, the emergence of the chinese economy. %$* 1
sometimes the historic perspective gives a very, very different view than what you see at the moment. %$* 1
and finally consider jimmy carter. %$* 1
he invented the term “stagflation,” we had 13 percent inflation, no economic growth, 19 percent interest rates. %$* 1
he abandoned the shah of iran who was a staunch american ally, enabled the ayatollahs to take over in iran. %$* 1
his ineptitude during the hostage crisis emboldened russia to invade afghanistan. %$* 1
he was a truly awful president. %$* 1
so, there’s a lot to be said on both sides here. %$* 1
and it’s my pleasure now to turn the evening over to john donvan, and the outstanding panel that we’ve assembled tonight. %$* 1
thank you, and may i just invite one more round of applause, sustained applause for mr. %$* 13
rosenkranz for making all of this possible. %$* 13
welcome to the symphony space in new york city, we are here with a sold-out audience, for an intelligence squared us debate, in which the motion is, “george w.bush is the worst american president of the last 50 years,” that is, “bush 43 is the worst president of the last 50 years.” i’m john donvan, your host and moderator, and tonight we have, arguing for the motion, an esteemed panel, to my left, to your right, beginning with jacob weisberg, who is editor-in-chief of slate and author of the bush tragedy. %$* 13
joining him on the same team, simon jenkins, a distinguished british newspaper editor and commentator. %$* 13
arguing against the motion, to your far right, karl rove, former deputy chief of staff to president bush. %$* 13
and his debating partner, bill kristol, editor of the weekly standard and chief of staff for former vice president dan quayle. %$* 13
the intelligence squared and intelligence squared us debates are supported by the rosenkranz foundation. %$* 13
now, shortly you will be hearing from our four panelists, two for the motion, and two arguing against. %$* 13
but this evening is a contest, a contest of wit and skill and logic and ideas and in that contest, you are the judges, we are going to poll you twice during the program, once now and once later. %$* 13
we want to poll you to see where you stand on the motion. %$* 13
after that the debate will be open for our opening statements, and then we’ll come to questions from you, the audience. %$* 13
so, if you turn to those keypads that each of you had at your seat %$* 13
as we explained before, it’ll only take a moment to vote, you press 1 if you agree with the motion that george w.bush is the worst american president of the last 50 years, 2 if you do not agree, that bush 43 is the worst president of the last 50 years. %$* 13
and number 3, if at this point you are undecided. %$* 13
does anyone need more time? %$* 13
terrific. %$* 13
we’ll come to those results shortly after we hear the opening statements from the panelists. %$* 13
for this point let us say, let the debate begin, our motion is, george w.bush is the worst president of the last 50 years, bush 43 is the worst president of the last 50 years. %$* 13
arguing first for the motion is jacob weisberg, a chairman and editor-in-chief of the slate group. %$* 13
he has just published a book, a history of the bush family in politics, its title, gives you a sense of where he is coming from on this debate, it is called the bush tragedy. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, jacob weisberg. %$* 13
if you need more time i’m afraid i can’t help you. %$* 126
i’d like to thank bob rosenkranz and intelligence squared. %$* 126
i feel like i’ve spent most of the past year watching presidential debates, it’s nice to finally be in one. %$* 126
please don’t change your minds, bush was obviously the worst president of the past 50 years. %$* 126
yet the task simon and i have tonight is extremely difficult. %$* 126
we have to convince a small fraction of you, at least if you’re anything like the people who have given bush the lowest approval rating of any post-war president, who still resist that conclusion. %$* 126
and to be honest i’m not sure that people who still defend the bush presidency are entirely open to persuasion. %$* 126
but i wanna try, by talking a little about how much bush has done wrong and how little he’s done right. %$* 126
let me first just tell you a little bit about my own perspective on this, i am not a bush hater. %$* 126
i’m not someone who can be described as a partisan democrat, the way mr. %$* 126
kristol and mr. %$* 126
rove are partisan republicans. %$* 126
i’m a centrist liberal, i’m fairly hawkish on security issues, i’m in favor of limited government. %$* 126
and let me just state up front, i think george w.bush was a fine governor of texas. %$* 126
i think ronald reagan was a successful president, and i think george h.w.bush, 41, understood foreign policy better than all but a few presidents in the post-war era. %$* 126
about two years ago, i started writing a book about the bush presidency. %$* 126
and i was gonna spend a lot of time on bush’s successes and accomplishments. %$* 126
and i’ll admit that i wanted to do that not just to be fair, but so i would look fair. %$* 126
and, i looked for the successes and accomplishments, and i looked, and i looked, and i came back totally empty-handed. %$* 126
there were a number of areas where i expected to stick up for bush, but i really found it impossible. %$* 126
for example, i was sympathetic to his approach to education reform. %$* 126
but even from a conservative perspective, bush didn’t allow— provide enough resources to allow for any real mobility or choice in public schools. %$* 126
instead of national standards which we needed he let the states write their own tests. %$* 126
that’s what the conservative base wanted. %$* 126
they don’t believe the federal government should be involved in education at all, and in caving in to them bush ensured that he’d make little meaningful progress on education and in fact, he has made very little meaningful progress. %$* 126
i thought bush was right about the need for immigration reform. %$* 126
and then i watched him surrender to the xenophobes and nativists in his own party. %$* 126
i thought bush was right to spend a lot of money fighting aids in africa. %$* 126
and then i watched him save far fewer lives than he might have, because of religious extremists, again in his own party, who believe abstinence propaganda’s more effective than condoms. %$* 126
i thought bush was right about free trade, and then i watched his lack of leadership lead to the collapse of the most important item on the global trade agenda, the doha development route. %$* 126
so, those are the partial successes. %$* 126
i can’t hope to cover all bush’s failures tonight. %$* 126
what would be a top failure for a president doesn’t even really make his top five. %$* 126
so, never mind his incompetent response to hurricane katrina, it doesn’t make the cut. %$* 126
never mind his denial of climate change and eight lost years on global warming, that doesn’t make the cut either. %$* 126
i’m just going to give you my top five. %$* 126
number one is the invasion of iraq. %$* 126
this was the most important decision of the bush presidency and he made it on the basis, as i think we all know, of the false premise that saddam hussein was threatening america with weapons of mass destruction, and consorting with al-qaeda. %$* 126
now i’m not someone who believes that bush deliberately falsified the evidence. %$* 126
but i believe he was totally uninterested in the evidence. %$* 126
this war would never have been fought, if bush had been interested in the truth as opposed to finding a pretext for something he wanted to do. %$* 126
i think his second biggest failure is the mismanaged occupation of iraq. %$* 126
bush refused for more than three years to change a failed military strategy. %$* 126
and almost the whole time people like my friend mr. %$* 126
kristol here were desperately insisting, rightly in my view, that bush needed to move to a counterinsurgency strategy. %$* 126
bush said, essentially, don’t bother me with the details. %$* 126
he delegated the strategy to rumsfeld and he ignored the failure. %$* 126
i think the surge has helped tremendously in iraq, the outrage is that bush moved to it in 2007, not in 2003 or 2004.his third biggest failure is undermining constitutional rights, and american ideals. %$* 126
now i can’t go into detail here about all the ways he abused his authority, and disregarded the rights of both foreigners and american citizens. %$* 126
but he and vice president cheney opened the door to torture, which led directly to the horrors of abu ghraib. %$* 126
he effectively suspended habeas corpus, holding suspects for years without charge or trail, and he took a perverse view of his office, claiming that virtually limitless executive authority was part of the inherent power of the presidency. %$* 126
his fourth failure was sabotaging american unity after september 11th. %$* 126
the day after the attacks, the front page of la monde in paris said “we are all americans.” the whole world was with us. %$* 126
but mr. %$* 126
bush and mr. %$* 126
rove saw september 11th as a political opportunity for what spiro agnew called, “positive polarization.” now simon is gonna speak to the harm, that this did to america’s image in the world. %$* 126
but i would just say, with a new administration coming into office, never in more than 200 years of our history has restoring america’s around the world been such an urgent project for a new president. %$* 126
number five, my last, is bush’s catastrophic economic mismanagement, which is so current we hardly even need to spell it out. %$* 126
it remains to be seen whether we’re facing a depression, whether bush will stand in for herbert hoover. %$* 126
but i think it’s clear that we’re living through the direct result of an ideological refusal to sensibly regulate financial markets. %$* 126
bush says he’s sorry about all the lost jobs, if you saw his interview on abc last night. %$* 126
but, as he loses his, the interesting question is whether he ever understood or understood now, his own contribution. %$* 126
now our opponents this evening, may try to argue that richard nixon or jimmy carter was worse. %$* 126
but neither of those presidents failed as badly as bush. %$* 126
carter had the camp david agreement, and despite watergate, nixon left historic accomplishments including opening relations with china, and creating the environmental protection agency. %$* 126
neither of them rivals bush for sheer, all-pervading incompetence. %$* 126
but if our opponents tonight— thank you. %$* 126
i’m closing here, if our opponents tonight wish to argue that bush was only the second worst president of the last 50 years, that’s not much of a defense. %$* 126
this national nightmare, i would suggest, has been the deepest and longest of all. %$* 126
thank you, jacob weisberg. %$* 13
and actually perfect timing. %$* 13
bill kristol is the editor of the influential washington-based political magazine the weekly standard. %$* 13
just over a year ago he wrote a piece predicting that president bush’s presidency would be remembered ultimately by history as a successful one. %$* 13
we bumped into each other on the street last week, and he said, “i’m still prepared to argue that, but can i leave out the us economy.” bill kristol, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 13
well, thanks, john, i’m still happy to argue that and it’s the truth— it’s good to be back on the upper west side, let me say i grew up just a mile from here, bella abzug was my congresswoman. %$* 127
and that made me a conservative. %$* 127
right. %$* 127
a decision i’ve not regretted, since then. %$* 127
bush was not my first choice, george w.bush was not my first choice for the republican nomination for the presidency in 2000, i’ve had my quarrels with the bush administration, but he’s been a pretty good president. %$* 127
he’s, it’s— well %$* 127
as we sit here safely, seven years after 9-11, having won a war in iraq, we can snicker and laugh with the us economy having grown 18 percent over the last eight years, faster than any other western advanced country, with the prescription drug benefits having been passed that has benefited many seniors which bush gets no credit at all which he took on his own party for, on issues like immigration he valiantly took on his own party and did an awful lot to try to get that through. %$* 127
bush has actually been a pretty impressive president, it’s unfortunate that the public has, for various reasons, some of them good, soured on bush, and he’s done a horrible job, his administration, of explaining what they’ve done and what the choices were. %$* 127
in the real world the choices are not, you know, perfection, and a pretty good presidency, in the real world he’s made a lot of tough decisions, most of them correct. %$* 127
when he became president al- qaeda was ascendant, saddam hussein was contained but unsustainably so, unless you think we could’ve had sanctions and inspectors for the last eight years. %$* 127
north korea and iran were secretly working on nuclear weapons programs, a.q.khan was dispensing nuclear material and know-how all over the world, pakistan had exploded a nuclear weapon, in 1998.then, 9-11, bush reacted to that correctly, basically. %$* 127
we have been protected here since then, we have al-qaeda on the run internationally. %$* 127
people can talk all they want about—there are a couple of things he did that he shouldn’t have done, these have been— they were fixed by people in his own administration. %$* 127
jack goldsmith, attorney general ashcroft, attorney general mukasey, have fixed some of the mistakes that were made under the pressure of trying to defend this country against a ruthless terrorist group that had taken 3,000 lives, history will look kindly on bush’s performance as a national security and homeland security president. %$* 127
and one piece of the proof is that obama is not going to change much. %$* 127
as the obama people get briefed on the threats, they see that the surveillance program is necessary. %$* 127
i suppose obama will close guantanamo and move, in effect, guantanamo here to the united states and put the people at fort leavenworth but he’s not going to release these people into the us. enhanced interrogation techniques which mccain and obama oppose, so i guess i’m a lonely person in defending those, saved an awful lot of lives when used on khalid sheik mohammed and i’m not willing to second-guess the decision, to use those techniques. %$* 127
bush was a strong president on national security, the decision to go into iraq was necessary i think. %$* 127
the middle east today, with saddam in power, or his sons in power, with terror connections, redeveloping the weapons of mass destruction programs presumably, since i don’t think we could’ve kept sanctions on, and inspectors in for eight years, would’ve been a much more dangerous place. %$* 127
the decision to go with the surge was a courageous decision, made in december 2006, january 2007 under great adverse pressure, with very little public support, very little support from the republican establishment, no support, obviously from almost any democrats except joe lieberman. %$* 127
it was the right decision, it’s been utterly vindicated. %$* 127
have we ever seen really, this kind of real-time test. %$* 127
bush said let’s do this, here’s what will happen, here’s how we’ll work, these critics said it can’t work, it wasn’t working, you’re crazy, more lives are gonna be thrown away, and we had a real-time test of who was right and who was wrong. %$* 127
and now barack obama of course being an intelligent person, admits that the surge worked, and we are now beginning to draw down in a position of success in iraq, not leaving a country that would’ve been a breeding ground for terror, i mean the degree to which bush does not get enough credit, for refusing to cut and run in 2007 in iraq, the degree to which people don’t appreciate the strategic, the geostrategic disaster that would’ve been, remains kind of amazing to me. %$* 127
we have a pretty good outcome in iraq, a very important ally in the middle east, that has sacrificed a lot in fighting terror groups, that is standing with us against iran, that has signed just a status of forces agreement with us, that will be a strategic partner with us. %$* 127
in a way this could be a strategic victory that could be the flip- side of the strategic defeat that the iranian revolution in 1979, was. %$* 127
the rest of bush’s foreign policy has been %$* 127
i have my quarrels with some of it, but most of it’s been pretty successful, the relationship with india, the management of the china and japan relationships. %$* 127
the europeans have been annoyed at bush at various times, on the other hand we’re working more closely with europe on iran than we ever have before, and for all the talk about the us image in the world, the truth is, barack obama’s not going to change those policies much at all. %$* 127
and i think it’s good as an america, if we get a lot of credit now with obama and people decide they like us better but the actual policies, the nato policies, the afghanistan policies, the iran policies, the pakistan-india policies, the china policies, are not going to change much. %$* 127
because they’re sensible pollicies. %$* 127
on the economy, obviously that’s been terrible in the last few months, i do think bush could’ve done some things differently but to be fair, it’s not as if the democrats had one prescription and bush had another, and we went down one road and that’s where we are. %$* 127
there were bipartisan mistakes, on some of the institutions like fannie and freddie. %$* 127
i’d say bush was more correct than the democrats, on others, he might’ve been somewhat less correct. %$* 127
we did have economic growth over these eight years, on the other hand, the big piece of deregulation that everyone loves to site as being the kind of key that unlocked the derivatives and the other instruments that have turned out to be, that spiraled out of control, the key that unlocked that was presumably the 1999 deregulation of financial institutions signed by bill clinton. %$* 127
bush didn’t sign any big deregulatory bill. %$* 127
so he gets a bit of a bum rap on the economy but, i won’t, i won’t make that my leading argument, for why bush was a successful president, but the prescription drug benefit has worked very well. %$* 127
it has preserved competition while coming in under budget and helped a lot of seniors, aid for africa has worked well, bush has fought for free trade against a democratic party that has tried to turn its back on free trade and would %$* 127
hopefully obama will follow bush and not some of his fellow democrats in that way. %$* 127
the proof is in the pudding. %$* 127
obama is not going to change many bush policies. %$* 127
so it’s a little ridiculous to say, bush is the worst president in 50 years, barack obama’s an intelligent, impressive man. %$* 127
he promises change, i hope he brings some change. %$* 127
but the fact of the matter is, obama’s presidency will be in most major respects, a continuation of the bush presidency, and that’s a good thing for the country. %$* 127
thank you, bill kristol. %$* 13
simon jenkins is a journalist and an author and writes a column for the guardian, he is a british subject, he is a friend of america, but has never hesitated to tell america when he thinks it has made mistakes, ladies and gentlemen, simon jenkins, arguing for the motion. %$* 13
well ladies and gentlemen, i just heard a wonderful suggestion, barack obama is going to be the second-worst president since the war. %$* 128
the only thing i think that might make you, or many of you at least, not agree that george bush is the worst american president of 50 years, is to hear somebody say it in a british accent. %$* 128
i’m acutely aware of the sensitivity of international comment. %$* 128
i am a deep skeptic about my own government, and i will not say much good of gordon brown, i won’t say a lot of good about hereditary monarchy. %$* 128
but if i hear someone with an american accent insult my queen i’ll hit them. %$* 128
there is something about foreign accents on these subjects, that gets people’s backs up, so i beg your pardon. %$* 128
the point i want to make is this. %$* 128
that there are really two american presidents. %$* 128
there’s a president of the united states of america, and that is entirely your business. %$* 128
but there’s a second american president. %$* 128
and he is the president of the western alliance, and in many senses since the end of the cold war, is seen as a sort of president of the rest of the world. %$* 128
i’ve just been in syria and lebanon. %$* 128
a lady speaking at a meeting made a rather moving remark. %$* 128
she said every single one of us round the world, went to the polls on november the 4th, but only some of us were let in. %$* 128
the vast majority disenfranchised, sat outside, while america decided on their economy, on their diplomacy, on their politics, in many cases on their lives. %$* 128
and it’s to that american president that i want to say a few words tonight. %$* 128
i’ve spent almost all my life cheerleading for america. %$* 128
i’m second to nobody in this noble cause. %$* 128
and i can tell you it’s not been easy this past eight years. %$* 128
but until the last eight years, i have always felt, that each american president, in some small sense, pushed uphill the great boulder of democratic freedom. %$* 128
every single one, i felt at the end of it, yeah, america’s done it again. %$* 128
we’ve made a bit of progress. %$* 128
i felt that was one of the great strengths of america, that it could push that boulder a bit uphill. %$* 128
it may have been a military intervention, it may have been a trade agreement, may have been a single example. %$* 128
whatever it was, somehow or other, there was progress forward with what i call the great american crusade. %$* 128
when george bush came to power i was rather in favor of him. %$* 128
i rather admired the program he put forth with this foreign policy. %$* 128
condoleezza rice’s famous article on a humble foreign policy, definitely appealed to me. %$* 128
i liked the remark about america setting the world an example by what it did at home, rather than by getting the 82nd airborne to lead kids to school. %$* 128
this seemed to me to be a refreshing, unbombastic, unostentatious diplomacy. %$* 128
then came 9-11.and i’ve always remembered those few weeks after 9-11, when the whole world was pro-american. %$* 128
yasir arafat gave blood for new yorkers. %$* 128
many people forget that. %$* 128
almost nobody, almost nobody, was not on america’s side for those two or three weeks. %$* 128
and the disaster that followed, going to war in %$* 128
true retaliation for it, is something from which i don’t think american policy has ever recovered. %$* 128
i’ve recently been touring around that arc of instability, and the consequences of the consequences of 9-11 really have been catastrophic. %$* 128
to pretend that iraq is a success is obscene. %$* 128
iraq today is more or less back to what it was like in 2004 and if karl or bill want to walk hand in hand with me down haifa street in baghdad, as you could still in 2004, well, i can tell you they won’t. %$* 128
afghanistan is heading in exactly the same direction, i think afghanistan’s going to be a far worse mistake than iraq. %$* 128
but in every single theater that you look, with the possible exception of japan which had been eccentrically mentioned, you will see what i can only describe as the wrong decisions taken. %$* 128
iran should not be a at the moment, it should much more like egypt, and it could’ve been. %$* 128
there’s no reason for undermining the pakistan government to the extent it has been undermined by american military intervention there. %$* 128
russia, a putative friend eight years ago, is now a serious menace. %$* 128
wherever you look, you see what i call the crashes down the road of neoconservatism, littering the highway of world affairs. %$* 128
this was unnecessary, it was not required by circumstance, it was choice, it was decisions made in washington. %$* 128
now those of us who feel very strongly about america, always regarded the basis on which america operated out of its area, america went abroad to do things, was that it had a sort of moral superiority. %$* 128
there was behind what it did, a backbone. %$* 128
and that backbone was the backbone on which those people who approved of american intervention abroad always relied on. %$* 128
i’m afraid under the leadership of the last eight years, that backbone has snapped. %$* 128
it has been simply impossible to tell countries elsewhere in the world that the american example, that the american intention, that the american execution of its intervention has been for the best. %$* 128
people just don’t see it that way. %$* 128
if you go round many of these countries today, and i mean today, you see the most extraordinary faith put in the next american president— %$* 128
if you go round the world today, you will find the most extraordinary faith in the person you’ve elected as your next president. %$* 128
i have never come across anything like it. %$* 128
a totally naïve belief, that this is the messiah, barack obama, has come to save not you, but everybody. %$* 128
he will solve the middle east. %$* 128
he will get out of iraq, he’ll get out of afghanistan, he’ll pacify pakistan, he’ll make friends with iran. %$* 128
ludicrous expectations are placed on the shoulders of this man. %$* 128
the reason why that’s happened is because people simply have despaired over the last eight years. %$* 128
the reason why, i think, unrealistic but possibly disastrous expectations are made of barack obama, is that, george bush, for better or for worse, george bush, has caused such a catastrophe in so many countries around the world. %$* 128
i congratulate you on voting for obama, i hope you will vote for this motion, thank you. %$* 128
simon, could you repeat that line because we wanna not edit the bell and %$* 13
if you go round the world today, you will find the most extraordinary faith in the person you’ve elected as your next president. %$* 128
i have never come across anything like it. %$* 128
a totally naïve belief, that this is the messiah, barack obama, has come to save not you, but everybody. %$* 128
he will solve the middle east. %$* 128
he will get out of iraq, he’ll get out of afghanistan, he’ll pacify pakistan, he’ll make friends with iran. %$* 128
ludicrous expectations are placed on the shoulders of this man. %$* 128
the reason why that’s happened is because people simply have despaired over the last eight years. %$* 128
the reason why, i think, unrealistic but possibly disastrous expectations are made of barack obama, is that, george bush, for better or for worse, george bush, has caused such a catastrophe in so many countries around the world. %$* 128
i congratulate you on voting for obama, i hope you will vote for this motion, thank you. %$* 128
thank you, simon jenkins. %$* 13
karl rove has been a member of president bush’s political family since president bush first decided to go into politics. %$* 13
it goes back more than two decades. %$* 13
he is known as the architect of the 2000 and 2004 victories. %$* 13
the president has referred to him as “the boy wonder.” ladies and gentleman, karl rove. %$* 13
thank you, john. %$* 129
thanks to intelligence squared for having me here tonight. %$* 129
simon, i know what you mean about the problem with foreign accents. %$* 129
and i noticed it didn't take you all long to vote, did it. %$* 129
i'm going to make an appeal to the open minded people of the upper west side. %$* 129
and for those of you sensitive to sulfur and brimstone, i apologize, nothing i can do about it. %$* 129
i’d like to spend my time talking about the drive-by’s we just saw. %$* 129
let’s start with education. %$* 129
we say a drive-by on no child left behind. %$* 129
sure, we said states should set standards. %$* 129
we didn't set one national standard, because we wanted the people in new york and the people in new mexico to be engaged in setting standards for their states, and to be involved in setting up a system that they would buy into. %$* 129
and in the five years since no child left behind has come into force around this country, which requires every state to set standards, and to test every child grades three through eight to find out if the children are meeting the standards for reading, writing, and other material, we have seen more improvement in reading and math and science scores in those five years than we’ve seen in the twenty-eight previous years combined. %$* 129
and the scores have gone up most %$* 129
the scores have gone up most among minority communities, black and brown and poor and rural. %$* 129
we heard about immigration, with a, a line that said, somehow or other the president threw in with the immigration restrictions. %$* 129
you know what, i don’t think that bill we brought to the floor of the united states senate was an immigration restrictions bill. %$* 129
it was a bill that resolved the problem in a comprehensive way, and the president showed courage by standing for it and making it possible. %$* 129
pepfar.i heard a dismissal of this incredible effort, by the generosity of the american people, that is today providing over two million people in africa with life saving retroviral drugs. %$* 129
now sure, we insist upon encouraging programs to have to educate people about abstinence and faithfulness within marriage, and how those can help break the cycle of the spread of aids.and it’s working. %$* 129
and free trade, i love this one, i love this one. %$* 129
i sat there and was part of the team that bled to win trade promotion authority, and you know how many votes we won it by? %$* 129
one. %$* 129
we got cafta, which was a no-brainer, should have been a no- brainer. %$* 129
you know how many votes we got it by? %$* 129
one. %$* 129
i sat there in that room, in the cabinet room with twenty-two democrats who voted for nafta, and china, and tpa under clinton, who could not bring themselves to vote for free trade under this president. %$* 129
why? %$* 129
politics. %$* 129
so, i appreciate the enthusiasm that some of our adversaries here at tonight’s debate have for free trade, and i'm looking forward to working with them in common cause on behalf of every free trade measure that comes before the united states congress. %$* 129
and why don’t we make a pact that we’ll start with columbia? %$* 129
why don’t we do that. %$* 129
now, about that invasion of iraq, i appreciated hearing about how it was done on a false premise, and hearing those words come from the mouth of somebody who wrote eloquently about the need to remove saddam hussein from power, i appreciate your support at the time. %$* 129
nice of you to flip flop now. %$* 129
easy to flip flop now. %$* 129
look, do we wish we had the, that the weapons were there? %$* 129
and it was justified under those terms? %$* 129
yeah. %$* 129
you know what? %$* 129
you know what, though? %$* 129
smart people, like bill clinton and al gore and john kerry and our new secretary of state designate sat on the floor of the congress or at the white house in the nineties, or in the congress in the 2000’s and said saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction. %$* 129
and we now know that there was a reason why he didn't have them, but he wanted us to think he had them. %$* 129
he told his interrogators he felt it made him look big in the neighborhood, and he, and we know from two reports by, by kay and duefler, that saddam hussein was intent upon recreating these programs the moment the west lost its interest in him. %$* 129
so he literally siphoned tens of millions of dollars out of the food for peace program to do two things, to keep together the engineers and the scientists and the technicians to reconstitute these programs, and to keep the dual use facilities to rapidly reconstitute particularly the chemical and biological programs. %$* 129
now, i loved also being lectured about sabotaging unity after 9/11.i sat there in those meetings on homeland security, where we had a great consensus about the need to defend the homeland by reorganizing our government, and the democrats insisted on one thing, that the department of homeland security should not be subject to the same constrictors regarding union membership that john f.kennedy put in place for the rest of the government in 1961, and that jimmy carter signed into law in 1979.they wanted the department of agriculture and the department of transportation to be governed by strictures that said, in a time of national security, certain elements of the agency could be declared off limits for union organizing, but they didn't want that same rule to apply to one department in the government, the department of homeland security. %$* 129
because they saw it as a sop for their union allies. %$* 129
that was not national unity in the aftermath of 9/11, and it was an absence of national unity, because there were democrats in the congress who never accepted the legitimacy of this president. %$* 129
talk about the mismanagement of the economy. %$* 129
let’s talk about it. %$* 129
the dow down thirty-eight percent, the nasdaq down seventy-eight percent. %$* 129
the s&p down fifty percent. %$* 129
six trillion dollars lost in value in one year. %$* 129
i'm not talking about today, i'm talking about march 2000, when the markets started to go down and bottomed out in october of 2002.thank god this president had the wherewithal and the political capital and the moxie to pass a large effective stimulus package of one point six trillion dollars over ten years that got the economy growing again by long lasting tax cuts that benefited everybody in america who pays taxes. %$* 129
even the critic ray fair at yale, who forecast that in 2000 his model said george bush would get thirty-four percent of the vote, he was just a little bit off, said that without this one out of every twenty american workers who were employed in 2001 and 2002 would not have been employed were it not for the tax cuts. %$* 129
now, we’ve heard some other things, fannie, and we’ve heard about yassir arafat, giving blood in the aftermath of 9/11.well, as long as america wasn’t going to throw over israel as our ally and friend, that was going to be a temporary act of friendship, and an enduring life of hate. %$* 129
and iran, it’s somehow our fault, bush’s fault, that the ayatollah’s, and the mullah’s, and the lunatics are pursuing a nuclear weapon in iran? %$* 129
i think that has to do with their decision to pursue a nuclear weapon, not us making them do it. %$* 129
and pakistan? %$* 129
i loved it, being lectured about undermining the government of pakistan. %$* 129
after all, haven't we just elected a president who promised to invade pakistan if it didn't comply with america’s wishes? %$* 129
now look, i will defend the president, and i will defend the record of the last eight years. %$* 129
not always successful, but enormously successful over the long term and the long sweep of history. %$* 129
thank you for having me here tonight. %$* 129
karl, you’ve got thirty seconds. %$* 13
and pakistan? %$* 129
i loved it, being lectured about undermining the government of pakistan. %$* 129
after all, haven't we just elected a president who promised to invade pakistan if it didn't comply with america’s wishes? %$* 129
now look, i will defend the president, and i will defend the record of the last eight years. %$* 129
not always successful, but enormously successful over the long term and the long sweep of history. %$* 129
karl rove, thank you very much. %$* 13
thank you for having me here tonight. %$* 129
thank you, karl rove. %$* 13
and that concludes the opening statements. %$* 13
in a minute or two we’re going to come to you, the audience, again, reminding you to keep your questions focused and brief and have a question mark at the end of it. %$* 13
but we now have the numbers that tell us your opinions as you came off the street tonight. %$* 13
on our motion that george w.bush is the worst president of the last fifty years, that bush 43 is the worst president of the last fifty years, sixty-five percent of you are for the motion, seventeen percent against, and eighteen percent undecided. %$* 13
and again, as we said at the beginning, we tend to judge success in this debate by how much you can actually move those numbers. %$* 13
so, if that sixty-five percent goes up, the side for will have prevailed, if the seventeen percent that is against goes up, that side will be seen to have prevailed. %$* 13
anyone ready with questions just yet? %$* 13
yes? %$* 13
lady standing here. %$* 13
you can sit if you’d like to, it’s up to you. %$* 13
this is a question for any member of the panel. %$* 10
what president in the last fifty years has faced the challenges that bush 43 has faced? %$* 10
very good, and very sharp and focused question. %$* 13
bill kristol. %$* 13
every president faces challenges, and obviously each different. %$* 127
but i think if you're implying that bush faced particularly stark challenges, with a plummeting economy as he took over, and then of course 9/11, for which the government wasn’t prepared, the country wasn’t prepared, the bush administration frankly wasn’t prepared, but certainly the clinton administration hadn't done much to help prepare for, i think the president reacted well to the challenges he faced. %$* 127
and that is what makes someone a reasonably successful president. %$* 127
he made mistakes, as he said recently in the interview. %$* 127
you know, he wasn’t, he hadn't realized he was going to have to fight two wars, no one thought we would do that, be doing that in october of 2000.he adjusted in the conduct of those wars, i think pretty well, and the same with homeland security, they made a couple of mistakes, but basically ended up, thank god, i think, hardening this country in a pretty effective way, and putting al qaeda on the run by taking the offensive. %$* 127
i really don’t understand this, i mean, pakistan, poor bush, he gets criticized not promoting democracy in pakistan enough. %$* 127
then we promote democracy in pakistan, we have elections, we actually have a rather good leader of pakistan, now he has a corrupt past, but has said the right things about trying to curb %$* 127
well, you can laugh about it, but it’s a tough place to govern. %$* 127
he’s trying to curb the isi and the terrorists. %$* 127
we’re now going in aggressively in the northwest frontier to take out al qaeda. %$* 127
i don’t think that’s a mistake. %$* 127
i think obama is right to support bush on that. %$* 127
so, i think bush adjusted well to very difficult circumstances. %$* 127
jacob weisberg, the implication of that question is that no president could have done well with these circumstances. %$* 13
what do you think of that? %$* 13
well i disagree with that. %$* 126
every president until, through bush’s father, had to manage the cold war which was infinitely more threatening to the existence of civilization than september 11th was. %$* 126
and in particular, if you want a particularly specific example, john f.kennedy and the cuban missile crisis, which probably brought us closer to armageddon than we’ve ever been. %$* 126
and the way kennedy personally managed that crisis, if you’ve ever seen the movie thirteen days, or listened to any of the tapes, is an amazing story, because he rejected the advice of very powerful people in his administration who claimed to know a lot more than he did. %$* 126
but his instincts were very good, and he made the decision that saved us all. %$* 126
audience questions. %$* 13
i'm going to collect a couple. %$* 13
to the right here, and then i want to get to the other side, i see a white sleeve halfway up, keep that hand waving and we’ll get a microphone to you. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 9
this is a question for mr. %$* 9
rove. %$* 9
i have great belief in the wisdom of the gross american population. %$* 9
if what you have said about the bush successes is true, how is it that his general, approval record is so extraordinarily and historically low. %$* 9
ok, i'm going to hold that question, karl, and collect a couple of others. %$* 13
but we will come to it. %$* 13
the gentleman with the white sleeve we spoke of? %$* 13
this is also a question for mr. %$* 9
rove. %$* 9
if the united states is known for its constitution and for respect for the rule of law, how would you rate the bush presidency? %$* 9
and as a follow-up question, why would you not testify in a criminal investigation related to abuse of government power? %$* 9
thank you. %$* 9
all right. %$* 13
we’re going to take these two questions. %$* 13
now, these questions are to karl, but i see an opening a truck could drive through for your opponents to also be part of this conversation. %$* 13
karl, the first question, why are the president’s approval ratings so low? %$* 13
yeah, well look, we’re asking, it’s an unpopular war, and we’re asking the country to do tough things for a long time. %$* 129
and the economy’s bad. %$* 129
i would remind you, not to correct mr. %$* 129
weisberg, but there have been three presidents who have had lower approval ratings that i'm aware of, carter, well actually four, carter, nixon, johnson, and truman. %$* 129
truman left office with numbers lower than this president’s. %$* 129
history has judged each of these men differently after their departure. %$* 129
if i could respond to the second one, rule of law. %$* 129
first of all, i'm not aware that i’ve refused to testify in a criminal investigation. %$* 129
you may know something i don’t know. %$* 129
you want to elucidate? %$* 129
i think what you may be suggesting is why will i not testify in front of the united states congress? %$* 129
and the reason is because i believe in the rule of law. %$* 129
the rule of law that says there’s a separation of powers between the executive and the legislative branches, and that the president of the united states has a right to receive confidential advice form his assistants, which has been upheld by the united states supreme court. %$* 129
now, right now it’s being re- litigated again, because the united states senate did not like the answer the white house gave them in the summer of july, in the summer of 2007.if i'm called upon, and a court of law says that the president has no such right, i’ll testify. %$* 129
in the house of representatives and in the senate, we have made numerous attempts to provide the congress with the information that it’s requested, in a way that protects the right of a president and his prerogative to receive that kind of advice from his staff, from his confidential advisors. %$* 129
the senate has refused to take any one of the options. %$* 129
the house refused to take five separate options that we gave them, until finally, some members of the house judiciary committee asked the questions that were being asked by the committee, and sent them to me. %$* 129
and under penalty, i responded to those, and if you like, you can find my answers at rove.com. %$* 129
so, i’ve answered them. %$* 129
but, there is a rule of law, and we ought to respect that rule of law that says there is a separation of powers between the branches, and that’s exactly why i’ve been directed by the president not to testify in front of congress on these issues. %$* 129
simon jenkins, i want to bring you into the conversation. %$* 13
we, the issue, that question was premised on the notion that america’s image has always rested on its adherence to the rule of law, and that the years of the bush administration have, to some degree, to seem to have been a disintegration of the value of the constitution. %$* 13
with barack obama now taking over, does the fact that he has this terrible image with which to compare himself, give him a boost, or does the fact that american leadership have been so diminished, respect for america has been so diminished, give him a terrible starting point? %$* 13
well, i think the origin of this whole part of the discussion is the response to 9/11.9/11 is the starting point of almost everything that we’ve been talking about. %$* 128
and i think many people in europe, and around the world, simply feel that america over- reacted, and so did britain, i may say. %$* 128
so, this is not something peculiar to america. %$* 128
it was a feeling that some new force had been unleashed on the world to which we had to respond by restricting our normal customary defenses and liberty. %$* 128
i'm a libertarian, and i feel that was, i’ve always felt that was simply unnecessary, the reaction was an overreaction. %$* 128
the consequence of it, however, is that we have, in a sense, played the terrorist’s game. %$* 128
we’ve done what they wanted us to do, which was restrict our liberties, curb our liberties, behave in a certain way towards other states and other peoples that we would not normally have done before. %$* 128
and— %$* 128
but i heard bill kristol saying, and bill, let me bring you into this, i’ve heard you say that, when it comes to terrorism, rather than playing the terrorist’s game, that the president has succeeded in putting the terrorists on the run, which is why 9/11 was the only incident in this city. %$* 13
would that they were on the run. %$* 128
bill kristol. %$* 13
well, they haven't been very successful here, and they haven't been very successful in western europe, and they’ve actually not been very successful elsewhere. %$* 127
al qaeda has been a losing proposition for the last several years. %$* 127
it remains a huge problem of, a jihadist impulse in the islamic world, which is, unfortunately, abetted by certain states. %$* 127
but i think bush has done a pretty good, well, a very good job of making terror a losing proposition, which is the most important thing he could have done, taken away their momentum, which again, if we had not gone into iraq, and if we had lost in iraq, that would have been the single most disastrous result. %$* 127
bush turned that around. %$* 127
but i just don’t buy this premise that we’ve radically curved civil liberties. %$* 127
bush has done less after the 9/11 attack than any other president has done, much, much less, he’s much more responsible than franklin roosevelt was after we were attacked in world war ii.he’s been much more solicitous of civil liberties than, if i might say, john kennedy and lyndon johnson were during, and richard nixon were, during vietnam. %$* 127
we’ve had, you know, some controversial calls, and some tough calls. %$* 127
there were a couple of over-reactions which the bush administration itself walked back, jack goldsmith and attorney general mukasey have, i think, corrected some controversial interpretations that probably went too far— %$* 127
bill, can i interrupt you— %$* 13
yeah. %$* 127
one second— %$* 126
jacob weisberg. %$* 13
jack goldsmith was drummed out of the bush administration for challenging those decisions— %$* 126
that's not true. %$* 127
he was not— %$* 126
they, he changed the actual office of legal counsel policy, and attorney general mukasey is leaving the bush legal program intact, and i— %$* 127
but if you— %$* 126
it’s totally defensible, and it will not be changed much by barack obama. %$* 127
if you read goldsmith’s book he was driven out, more or less. %$* 126
but the point is you-- %$* 126
i'm amazed by-- %$* 126
i appreciate how open minded you are about some of these issues. %$* 126
but on the civil liberties issues, you're amazingly cavalier. %$* 126
closing guantanamo is no big deal, we have them here, we have them there. %$* 126
torture, you won't second guess the decisions. %$* 126
i mean, these go to the heart of the questions about the rule of law and the constitution, and the question of whether terror suspects %$* 126
ok, well what is the question? %$* 127
the question— %$* 126
bush— %$* 127
the question— %$* 126
bush has lost fewer court decisions than almost any president has. %$* 127
he lost two five to four decisions. %$* 127
you can, maybe the five were right, maybe bush shouldn't have gone quite as far as he did in some of the claims he made about guantanamo. %$* 127
but we are going to have to detain people. %$* 127
we are not going to be able to provide them all civil trials. %$* 127
i do not believe that is a way you can deal with terrorists captured on the battlefield. %$* 127
why can't you deal with them with military trials? %$* 126
we have an existing— %$* 126
we are, he set up a system of military trials— %$* 127
no, he set up his own alternate system. %$* 126
we already had a system of military justice— %$* 126
he signed legislation— %$* 127
he decided he needed his own— %$* 126
that congress passed. %$* 127
he signed legislation that congress passed in 2005 and 2006. %$* 127
karl rove, let’s bring in karl rove. %$* 13
and i just want to say, it’s fine to register your reaction to this with applause. %$* 13
i heard it for jacob, i haven't heard it for bill kristol. %$* 13
i mean, is there a sense of support for, for bill kristol’s argument? %$* 13
no, no, no %$* 127
karl rove? %$* 13
don’t, don’t be doing that again, john, we’ve lost sixty- five/seventeen. %$* 129
come on, man. %$* 129
i’m delighted that we did better than the upper west side— %$* 129
i was trying to get the seventeen to applaud here. %$* 13
you know, we got eight percent of the vote in one of the precincts up here, i mean, come on, man! %$* 129
come on! %$* 129
all right, look, it’s clever to suggest that we ought to have the military, the style of courtroom justice we provide to our military, and provide that for enemy non-combatants, i mean enemy combatants. %$* 129
we shouldn't. %$* 129
that’s what we attempted to do in the military justice system, is to the greatest possible degree possible duplicate our civil justice system. %$* 129
and are you suggesting that we ought to mirandize these people and keep a chain of evidence and all the other things that we normally do in both military and civilian courts for terrorists? %$* 129
not at all, and people have far fewer rights under the military system. %$* 126
but the point is, under your system, they have no rights. %$* 126
the prisoners at guantanamo were originally denied access to a lawyer, we couldn't even find out who was there, and the original claim by the bush administration was that this applied to citizens as well as non-citizens. %$* 126
so, if the bush administration decided that you were suspected of terrorism, you could be held indefinitely without a lawyer, without a hearing, without a trial. %$* 126
you know what— %$* 129
i'm not saying that these— %$* 126
with all due respect, you're making it sound like everybody on the upper west side needs to worry about being sent to the reeducation camps in texas. %$* 129
and in reality what it was focused at is, if we picked up a us citizen who was a terrorist on a battlefield abroad, would we subject him to us law, or would we treat them as a terrorist— %$* 129
but here’s what you slipped in, if we picked up someone who’s a terrorist. %$* 126
what if they happen not to be a terrorist? %$* 126
some of these people have been acquitted. %$* 126
and the system has a process of review in which that determination can be made. %$* 129
anyway, the big picture, look, the fact is in the big picture— %$* 127
name one guy you're worried about— %$* 129
let’s take it to bill kristol. %$* 13
name one guy you're worried about. %$* 129
no, that's exactly right. %$* 126
you're worried about john, john lindh? %$* 129
you're worried about him? %$* 129
i'm, i'm— %$* 126
i mean, what person are you worried about? %$* 129
was the bush administration bad at explaining their policies, especially abroad? %$* 127
yes. %$* 127
did people abroad take a kind of cavalier and really, hypocritical sense of pleasure in decrying those ridiculous americans with all this stuff? %$* 127
while they themselves, of course, as you know well, in continental europe, treat their own citizens with many less rights, are much, much nastier to their minorities, bush went out of his way, and with great success, to say this is not a war on islam, we need to protect everybody’s rights, he was incredibly solicitous, as he should have been of muslim-americans, muslim-americans here have a much fairer and more equal playing field than muslims do in most of these wonderful european countries that sit around having heart attacks about two hundred people held at guantanamo %$* 127
simon, let’s— %$* 13
and let’s just talk, bush made two supreme court appointments, they were incredibly highly qualified. %$* 127
alito, sixty-one appointments to federal courts. %$* 127
whatever, they were conservative, of course, as obama’s will be liberal, extremely highly qualified judges. %$* 127
he made a couple of mistakes, i think, in his appointments, out of excessive loyalty, perhaps with alberto gonzales, but the fact is, ashcroft was a serious attorney general, and then he brought in mukasey, and he’s leaving an intact and functioning legal system which we can be proud of given the threats we’re facing. %$* 127
simon jenkins? %$* 13
what i think is extraordinary to people abroad, is that those of us who are enthusiasts for america and american liberties cannot see why you needed to do these things. %$* 128
you will never persuade the outside world that you have not restricted liberty in america. %$* 128
you will never persuade them that you have not taken out muslims as a particular group, and you will never, and you never persuade them that you really needed to do these things. %$* 128
what things? %$* 127
because— %$* 128
what have we done to muslims in america? %$* 127
what has happened? %$* 127
arrested them. %$* 128
we’ve arrested muslims in america? %$* 127
incarcerated them without trial. %$* 128

you, you— %$* 95
they were in the dark. %$* 98
i’d like to return to this discussion about abu ghraib and those prisoners after, but first, we have two more speakers to hear from, for the motion, rick francona. %$* 92
well, we’ll just follow up on some of this, i had several pages of notes here, but heather and david went through them quite quickly, so— i’ll speak to some of the subjects that we’ve brought up here—all this is great theory. %$* 97
i appreciate what all of the other speakers have brought to this, and most of the time we’re talking theory. %$* 97
i’d like to inject some reality into this. %$* 97
i’m going to submit that i’m probably the only one on the stage that’s been waterboarded. %$* 97
i don’t consider it torture, but by no means do i consider it pleasant and it’s not something you sign up to do, you know, for your summer camp. %$* 97
the air force did it during our training to show us what it was like, the purpose of it was to show us the treatment that we could expect as potential prisoners of war. %$* 97
and the point was made and i want to underscore this, never in our history have we gone into a conflict and our prisoners been treated right, the geneva convention was an attempt to make that happen. %$* 97
i submit that it has failed miserably. %$* 97
it restricts what we can do, we make sure we treat people right, and we get no reciprocal treatment at all. %$* 97
so it does not work—now. %$* 97
john mccain will tell you that torture doesn’t work, and that he’s against it because of his experiences in north vietnam. %$* 97
no one can take away the fact that he was brutally treated, brutally tortured, and he has the gravitas to address this issue. %$* 97
but you have to understand that john mccain was the victim of torture for the infliction of pain. %$* 97
the vietnamese were great at that. %$* 97
they could hurt you, they could make you say things that maybe you didn’t want to say. %$* 97
for the most part, our prisoners did very well. %$* 97
they gave up what they thought their interrogators wanted to hear which is the biggest threat you have when you resort to torture. %$* 97
whoever you’re torturing, the subject, is going to tell you what he thinks you want to hear. %$* 97
just like a defector, we’ve seen how bad information leads to bad actions, remember curveball. %$* 97
the bad information about the iraqi mobile labs. %$* 97
this is another instance where people tell you things they want to hear. %$* 97
someone being tortured will tell you anything, anything, to stop the pain, to stop the treatment. %$* 97
waterboarding, someone mentioned a figure 60 to 90 seconds. %$* 97
i can tell you that after about 35 seconds i was ready to tell them anything they wanted to hear. %$* 97
and i knew this was an exercise. %$* 97
you know, and in the back of your mind, your instructors are telling you, project yourself into a situation. %$* 97
imagine this to be real. %$* 97
i survived by telling myself, i know this is a game. %$* 97
that they’re going to let me up before i drown. %$* 97
so, there is that reflex, and waterboarding is so powerful, that it will make you say something. %$* 97
so, in the hands of skilled interrogators, can waterboarding work? %$* 97
absolutely, but you have to know what you’re doing. %$* 97
the north vietnamese did not know what they were doing. %$* 97
they were great at inflicting pain, lousy at extracting effective, useful intelligence. %$* 97
now does it work? %$* 97
well, you hate to say trust the government. %$* 97
but we have two government officials that say it worked. %$* 97
that would be the former director of central intelligence, george tenet, and the director of the bin laden unit, alex station. %$* 97
dr. %$* 97
mark shore, you’ve seen him on television, he’s making the rounds, i think he has a book out. %$* 97
it can be effective if it’s done properly. %$* 97
the question is, not, can we do it, the question is, should we do it? %$* 97
and that’s where we have to decide, or is the tough interrogation of these suspects necessary %$* 97
do we want to go beyond whatever line that is. %$* 97
i can tell you the line that the government is trying to draw, is the army field manual, i worked under the army field manual, it’s pretty restrictive, the new one is even more restrictive, they rewrote it in november of 2006.it’s online, type in to google, “army field manual interrogation,” it’s a voluminous document, it’s written in typical army bureaucratese, there’s probably four pages in it worth reading. %$* 97
so, and those are the ones that tell you the 16 psychological approaches you can use, none of which will be effective against a terrorism suspect because those techniques were written, just as someone said, to break a captured enemy soldier. %$* 97
one probably with no resistance training whatsoever. %$* 97
when we started taking large amounts of prisoners, in desert storm, we had thousands, tens of thousands of iraqi prisoners that we had to interrogate, we had to assess, and determine if they were worth questioning. %$* 97
and once we determined that they were worth questioning, most of the time if you asked them a question, they gave you the answer. %$* 97
it was very surprising to us, to learn that all these techniques really weren’t necessary because the iraqis had no training, most of them were happy just to be away from saddam hussein. %$* 97
very powerful tool. %$* 97
the ones that did not want to cooperate with us, usually you found some major or lieutenant-colonel in the republican guard that didn’t want to talk to you, and that’s when those techniques became somewhat effective, but there were always ones that would spit at you, because they knew you couldn’t hurt them. %$* 97
they knew the americans followed the geneva conventions. %$* 97
they knew, that you weren’t gonna hurt them. %$* 97
you couldn’t touch them. %$* 97
until some—and i won’t use any personal references here, some lieutenant-colonels i know, would throw them down to the ground, pull out a pistol, put it to their forehead and say, tell me what i need to know, whatever the question was, or i’m gonna blow your brains out. %$* 97
that now will get you thrown out of the army, without your retirement. %$* 97
back then it was not common use but it was pretty effective because, it’s real easy in theory to know that the americans can’t hurt you. %$* 97
but, when the gun is on your forehead, you’re not sure if this is the one american that didn’t get the memo. %$* 97
so this can be effective. %$* 97
now, i think we— %$* 97
—we have to be somewhat reticent in applying these forms of interrogation. %$* 97
but i think we would be foolish, absolutely foolish to outlaw them. %$* 97
i think the president was right to veto any bill that limits what the cia can do. %$* 97
and this is only limiting the cia, the neutered department of defense is already constrained by the army field manual. %$* 97
the idea is to extend that to the entire government. %$* 97
i think that’s a mistake, we still have to have this tool in our arsenal because some people in the government who’ve done this for a living, say that it works. %$* 97
george tenet said it saved lives, i don’t know that to be true, i don’t know it to be not true. %$* 97
but i think we would be very foolish to take an arrow out of the quiver. %$* 97
and i do think this is an existential war. %$* 97
and i think it is a war that we’re gonna be fighting for a long time. %$* 97
i think we need to apply every weapon we have. %$* 97
one. %$* 92
sorry— %$* 92
—we have to be somewhat reticent in applying these forms of interrogation. %$* 97
but i think we would be foolish, absolutely foolish to outlaw them. %$* 97
i think the president was right to veto any bill that limits what the cia can do. %$* 97
and this is only limiting the cia, the neutered department of defense is already constrained by the army field manual. %$* 97
the idea is to extend that to the entire government. %$* 97
i think that’s a mistake, we still have to have this tool in our arsenal because some people in the government who’ve done this for a living, say that it works. %$* 97
george tenet said it saved lives, i don’t know that to be true, i don’t know it to be not true. %$* 97
but i think we would be very foolish to take an arrow out of the quiver. %$* 97
and i do think this is an existential war. %$* 97
and i think it is a war that we’re gonna be fighting for a long time. %$* 97
i think we need to apply every weapon we have. %$* 97
against the motion, jack cloonan. %$* 92
good evening. %$* 98
i don’t believe that harsh interrogation techniques actually work. %$* 98
i’m going to explain to you why, and i’m going to explain a little of my background as to why i’ve come to that conclusion. %$* 98
the question before us tonight is actually very, very important and it’s very, very important to you personally. %$* 98
i’m going to take us down from this sort of nuanced, 30,000-foot view that we’ve had discussed thus far, and i’m gonna take it down to what i like to call the practical level, the operator’s viewpoint, because that’s where i come from. %$* 98
that’s what my job was. %$* 98
that’s what i was charged to do. %$* 98
i was charged in 1996, to eliminate bin laden, ayman al-zawahiri and others as a threat to us national security. %$* 98
and i found myself in the enviable position of having to travel around the world, and find members of al qaeda, and gain their cooperation. %$* 98
and i can assure you as i sit here tonight, being very proud of what the end result of that was, that i did not engage in any harsh interrogation techniques. %$* 98
it didn’t involve sleep deprivation, it didn’t involve threats from dogs. %$* 98
it didn’t involve hijinks, and all the other stuff that we’ve heard about. %$* 98
we have a deficit, ladies and gentlemen, that we are facing. %$* 98
and that deficit has to be, that we do not have as we sit here tonight, really good human intelligence. %$* 98
yes, we spend an awful lot of money. %$* 98
we can intercept and suck up emails from all around the world. %$* 98
but we don’t really know what we have. %$* 98
we have a very hard time processing what we have. %$* 98
and when you have the opportunity to sit across the table from a real member of al qaeda, a person who has raised their right hand and swore bayat, or allegiance to sheikh bin laden, it’s your obligation to get information from them, and to ensure that that information is reliable. %$* 98
i would think even rick would freely admit, in some of his writings he has stated that harsh interrogation techniques typically don’t work. %$* 98
in fact, rapport building is what works. %$* 98
we’re always having this discussion about the ticking bomb. %$* 98
the scenario that if we don’t get this information right away when we’re confronted with somebody who we believe has this sort of information, that lives will be at stake, and that we have to engage in these harsh interrogation techniques or, as we’ve just described, waterboarding. %$* 98
when abu zubaydah was waterboarded, and we now know that to be the case, he was waterboarded after he was in custody for thirty days. %$* 98
he was waterboarded because the agency, the cia would argue, because what we were trying to get out of him we weren't getting out of him. %$* 98
yet i have been able to speak to people who told me rhyme and verse about abu zubaydah. %$* 98
abu zubaydah is not what you think he was. %$* 98
abu zubaydah was a great travel agent. %$* 98
he was a logistics person. %$* 98
he was not what has been described, as a key al qaeda operative, quite the opposite. %$* 98
so when we engage in these techniques, there is a pushback from the opposition. %$* 98
and what does that pushback mean to you? %$* 98
what does that mean to you and your families? %$* 98
because when we push back and when we engage in these type of techniques, the opposition is duty-bound, the enemy, as we’ve heard described here tonight, is duty-bound to get revenge. %$* 98
there is a constituency that you have not heard from tonight. %$* 98
and that is al qaeda. %$* 98
i am going to tell you what al qaeda has to say about torture. %$* 98
i am going to tell you what sheikh bin laden had to say about torture. %$* 98
and i'm going to tell you that from the prospective of having to deal with ali abdul saud mohammed who created the encyclopedia of jihad. %$* 98
who taught people what to do and not to do if in fact arrested by the unbelievers, we, the blood people. %$* 98
bin laden’s view was that any brother who was picked up and withstood torture for 72 hours, he and the other members of al qaeda would not seek revenge against him. %$* 98
even bin laden understood and did not take revenge against those who cooperated with the united states. %$* 98
think about that for a moment. %$* 98
i can talk to you about ibn al-sheikh al-libi, which you’ve probably all heard about. %$* 98
i happened to be on the receiving end of a lot of information that ibn al-sheikh al-libi was giving up to the fbi in bagram, afghanistan. %$* 98
ibn al-sheikh al- libi is the man who’s alleged to have given information that was used in colin powell’s speech before the united nations. %$* 98
ibn al- sheikh al-libi agreed to cooperate with the united states %$* 98
through rapport building. %$* 98
and he agreed to cooperate with the united states, but he was duct taped, put into a cardboard-, or a, or plywood box, and shipped and rendered off to egypt to be interrogated. %$* 98
he had agreed to cooperate with us. %$* 98
this was a policy decision that was made. %$* 98
good counterterrorism policy has to include the end result of what we do, whether it’s on the battlefield or whether it’s on the streets of new york. %$* 98
rapport building, treating people humanely, getting information, solid intelligence is what we’re after. %$* 98
there’s too much at stake, your safety is at stake, to engage in harsh interrogation techniques, which is going to cause the enemy to seek revenge against each of you. %$* 98
one. %$* 92
through rapport building. %$* 98
and he agreed to cooperate with the united states, but he was duct taped, put into a cardboard-, or a, or plywood box, and shipped and rendered off to egypt to be interrogated. %$* 98
he had agreed to cooperate with us. %$* 98
this was a policy decision that was made. %$* 98
good counterterrorism policy has to include the end result of what we do, whether it’s on the battlefield or whether it’s on the streets of new york. %$* 98
rapport building, treating people humanely, getting information, solid intelligence is what we’re after. %$* 98
there’s too much at stake, your safety is at stake, to engage in harsh interrogation techniques, which is going to cause the enemy to seek revenge against each of you. %$* 98
thank you. %$* 92
i have one last question and only a few minutes to get an answer, and i'm going to address the same question to both sides. %$* 92
and that is, is this foe different from the other foes that we’ve faced? %$* 92
this foe has stated, especially the high-value prisoners, those on the inside of al qaeda have stated that it is-, they are ready for death. %$* 92
can you break this foe by building a rapport? %$* 92
jack? %$* 92
rick? %$* 92
yeah, i’ll take that. %$* 97
ideally, you want to break any foe. %$* 97
and jack goes-- %$* 97
i mean, i agree that rapport building, if you have time, is the best way to go. %$* 97
the question is sometimes you don’t. %$* 97
the other point is sometimes you don’t have the time. %$* 97
but i believe this foe is a different one that we’ve ever-- %$* 97
than we’ve ever faced before. %$* 97
we’re not dealing with a state. %$* 97
we’re not dealing with someone with defined borders. %$* 97
the people-- %$* 97
these are not soldiers in an army. %$* 97
this is an ideal. %$* 97
this is a-- %$* 97
these are committed warriors in a religious battle. %$* 97
and i think that brings something that we’ve never dealt with before, and i don't think we’re very well-prepared to do that. %$* 97
if just %$* 95
and, and can i also add something that %$* 93
just briefly, here. %$* 92
was already mentioned. %$* 93
the destructive power—this is an asymmetrical war as john said. %$* 93
the destructive power that now lies available to individuals that are not a member of the state, that cannot be deterred as states can is unlike anything that we’ve faced before. %$* 93
with the %$* 93
let me just-- %$* 95
one sentence. %$* 95
availability of nuclear weapons. %$* 93
our distinguished colleagues don’t have their act together. %$* 95
jack seems to be arguing that it is silly to counterproductively use stress techniques and accomplish reliable rapport. %$* 95
nobody disagrees. %$* 95
nobody would-- %$* 95
be a fool to suggest to promiscuously use stress techniques. %$* 95
but it’s equally foolish to say we should never use them. %$* 95
because there may be circumstances where they’re necessary. %$* 95
and the true wisdom lies in ascertaining which one is which, and mistakes can be made. %$* 95
but wouldn’t it be a mistake, jack, to just take something entirely off the table? %$* 95
how %$* 94
do you think that everybody is subject to %$* 95
to the %$* 95
that’s a sentence? %$* 98
let me address %$* 92
where was the period? %$* 98
let me address this to jack first. %$* 92
because you raise the issue of rapport building as an effective way to get actionable intelligence %$* 92
it’s the only effective way. %$* 98
can %$* 92
well no, i-- %$* 98
that’s not what i'm saying. %$* 98
i used the word rapport- building, certainly. %$* 98
did i engage in harsh interrogation techniques? %$* 98
of course i did. %$* 98
but harsh doesn’t mean that i was engaging in sleep depravation. %$* 98
it doesn’t mean that i was engaging in some of these other techniques that we’ve now all identified. %$* 98
the harshest thing i ever had to do was to let somebody listen to barry manilow for twenty-four hours. %$* 98
that would be considered %$* 98
sounds awful. %$* 93
you know %$* 98
doesn’t it? %$* 98
honestly. %$* 98
no. %$* 98
what, what i'm saying is that we-- %$* 98
there is this supposition out there that al qaeda is everywhere. %$* 98
there’s a supposition that the taliban, you know, is, is, is al qaeda and we fail to make distinctions between that. %$* 98
if i ask the audience tonight, and i’ll ask my distinguished colleagues up here, and david, you can be the first one. %$* 98
how many members of al qaeda do you think there are? %$* 98
oh boy. %$* 92
is this, uh, multiple choice? %$* 92
i mean, the other side is arguing that this enemy is so vast, so depraved, so craven, they want to kill thousands of us. %$* 98
there’s no question about that. %$* 98
there’s no question that, that what they want to do-- %$* 98
we saw that. %$* 98
but my point to you is, when i took the original membership lift off of ali mohammed, who are al qaeda, there were seventy-two members. %$* 98
there’s probably a lot more now. %$* 92
well-, the sales stru-, the sales structure within al qaeda %$* 98
uh-huh. %$* 93
consists of four to six operatives. %$* 98
you are trying to find, on a beach, a small dime. %$* 98
that’s what we’re up against. %$* 98
but jack, that’s a different argument. %$* 93
i mean, it doesn’t matter whether they have a million or ten thousand, again, given the availability of weapons of mass destruction, that’s what we’re up against. %$* 93
and that’s the fear, that a small %$* 93
what are the weapons of mass destruction that they have %$* 94
number of people %$* 93
airplanes? %$* 94
you can-, there is the possibility of %$* 93
they don’t have nuclear weapons. %$* 94
nuclear weapons. %$* 93
come on, heather. %$* 94
where, where. %$* 94
you don’t-, you think it’s not going to happen? %$* 93
you think al qaeda’s got nuclear weapons? %$* 94
i'm going to break in here. %$* 92
they’re seeking %$* 95
come on %$* 94
there’s-, it’s never-, it’s not a %$* 93
they’re relentlessly seeking %$* 95
a puzzle. %$* 93
i'm glad, i'm glad to %$* 93
relentlessly seeking? %$* 94
rick may-, rick may know this. %$* 98
al qaeda first tried to get fissionable material in 1993.what they got was red mercury, they got scammed. %$* 98
and we got that from, what? %$* 98
we got that from one of the guys that we cooperated with. %$* 98
so not only did we learn about what they were trying to do, we knew how they went about it. %$* 98
i hope that will prompt %$* 92
there, the %$* 96
the audience to raise questions about the actual nature and the extent of the threat. %$* 92
i'm going to be turning to you in just a moment. %$* 92
but first, i want to announce the results of the pre- debate vote. %$* 92
and before the debate, for the motion, which is-- %$* 92
, i want to have the exact wording here, “tough interrogation of terror suspects is necessary.” 46% of you voted for the motion. %$* 92
35% voted against the motion. %$* 92
19% were undecided. %$* 92
so, so much for some on the panel that thought this was going to be an excessively liberal audience. %$* 92
so, now i’d like to open up the floor for q&a.please stand up when you have your question. %$* 92
i ask that you don’t start to ask your question until you have the microphone, this is radio. %$* 92
please make the questions short and to the point. %$* 92
and it would be great if members of the press would identify themselves as such. %$* 92
have we got a question ready? %$* 92
all right. %$* 92
the arguments on both sides so far have been mostly utilitarian. %$* 9
torture works, torture doesn’t work. %$* 9
torture has side effects. %$* 9
but there hasn’t been much said about the moral high ground, and america showing leadership in an ethical and moral universe. %$* 9
the “do unto others as you would have them do unto you.” what about the moral issue in here, which i think is a problem that many of us have? %$* 9
can i just say very briefly, let the record show, that nobody’s arguing on our side in favor of torture. %$* 95
the shame, frankly, the fault lies with the critics that damn everything with the t word and paint with a broad brush. %$* 95
we’re not talking about torture. %$* 95
we’re talking about the level of coerciveness and unpleasantness that permeates our spheres of public life without drawing any opposition from anybody. %$* 95
you tell me why in order for us to occupy the moral high ground we should eschew, give up, whatever verb you want to use, a level of coercion that is routinely used in other areas, including training of our own troops, specialized and advanced training, federal and state penitentiaries, boot camps for juvenile offenders. %$* 95
that makes no sense for us as a society to-- %$* 95
instead of having a common baseline that is not torture-- %$* 95
to have privileged, uniquely privileged-, only one set of people, captured al qaeda and taliban terrorists. %$* 95
if that is morality, it’s silly. %$* 95
the %$* 95
that’s david rivkin. %$* 92
darius rejali? %$* 92
do you want to try this one on? %$* 92
sure. %$* 96
i’ll take that on. %$* 96
look, you keep on saying that we do these things domestically and we should do them internationally and what’s the problem. %$* 96
well, a couple of problems. %$* 96
first of all, let me just say a couple of things. %$* 96
a young professor comes to me and he says, “could you tell me exactly what sexual harassment is? %$* 96
i mean, if i do a little bit of it, is it ok? %$* 96
” you’d think that’s creepy, right? %$* 96
these people are talking about, “let’s do a little bit of it.” and it’s creepy. %$* 96
and it should creep you out, okay? %$* 96
because there are certain things you shouldn’t get anywhere near. %$* 96
the line between domestic and international, whatever you want to call these things, not torture, is a thin one. %$* 96
and every war that we have used torture, the philippines, when we used that in the insurgency, those guys, they come home, what kind of jobs do they get? %$* 96
they get jobs as policemen, prison guards, and your private security officials. %$* 96
and behind them follows torture. %$* 96
or not torture, call it what you will. %$* 96
chicago is paying twenty million dollars thanks to mr. %$* 96
burge and his fifty detectives who brought all their lovely techniques back from vietnam. %$* 96
look, at the end of this war, whether these guys get their way or not, people are coming back. %$* 96
and they’re going to be your cops, your neighborhood officials. %$* 96
they’re going to be your private people. %$* 96
and yes, there is a difference between domestic- international. %$* 96
but this stuff travels. %$* 96
darius, do %$* 93
let me make another point, too. %$* 96
that if this %$* 96
why does %$* 93
is, if this is important for us to do, to save american lives because we’ve got this superhuman enemy that we have never faced before, because this foe is different and they are so dedicated, if this is important for us to do at some level, then to the moral imperative question, why should we stop at all? %$* 96
why not the rack? %$* 96
why not perfidy? %$* 96
why not treachery? %$* 96
why not all kinds of things? %$* 96
because if that’s the moral thing to do in order to save lives, then by george, we ought to be doing it across the board and not stopping ourselves anywhere short. %$* 96
i think that the world has relied, we’ve, the united states has been far from perfect. %$* 96
our history is replete with examples of where we have failed in big things and in little things. %$* 96
but the world has relied on us to stand for the rule of law and for human rights. %$* 96
and it’s not a rule of law, if you only apply it when it’s convenient. %$* 96
and it’s not a human right if it only applies to some people. %$* 96
we need to stand tall in this, and not draw lines because this enemy is the worst enemy we have ever faced. %$* 96
i—i— %$* 95
i can—let me just argue that, first of all what we are doing is within the rule of law because a terrorist detainee is not covered by the geneva convention— %$* 93
it’s how you define the law— %$* 94
and—we are— he is covered by the convention against torture, there is no question. %$* 93
we are obligated to follow the convention against torture, that’s why it matters to make the distinctions that darius refuses to. %$* 93
we are not arguing torture on this side. %$* 93
and darius, you seem to think that the only possible set of questioning techniques are these random— it was rather arbitrary what got put into the army field manual. %$* 93
you yourself know, there has been, contrary to the claims on the other side, there has been no serious empirical work on the—even on the army field manual. %$* 93
are you suggesting that those are the only possible %$* 93
questioning techniques that can ever be used, and that somehow they are handed down from on high as the absolute way of questioning. %$* 93
there may have been 12, if mutt and jeff had not originally been included in them, my guess is that if we were now pro— %$* 93
mutt and jeff— %$* 92
—proposing— %$* 93
—are good cop-bad cop— %$* 92
good cop-bad cop— %$* 93
—for people who don’t know the— %$* 92
—you would call that torture as well because that wouldn’t be in the army field manual— %$* 93
no, actually, heather, i think you’re getting— %$* 96
so that’s why i think again— %$* 93
—your distinctions quite all confused here— %$* 96
—we need to—we need to discuss— %$* 93
—whether stress is torture. %$* 93
all right— %$* 92
heather, listen. %$* 96
i’m the one who argued for public cooperation, because al qaeda is living—is like a fish in a sea. %$* 96
you need to push it out of the water. %$* 96
it’s a small group of people, and you need to have iraqi civilians come in and turn people and i have not been the one who argued for the interrogation manual. %$* 96
i have said, that all the studies show that unless you have public cooperation on your side, the chances that you will be able to clear and solve a crime will fall to 10 percent regardless of how you interrogate them, right. %$* 96
so it doesn’t matter what you throw at this problem, right. %$* 96
and the more you do your not-torture stuff, the more problematic it is, let me get to another thing. %$* 96
barbaric, different kind of enemy, sure. %$* 96
they’re vengeful. %$* 96
and in the middle east, they never forget. %$* 96
you know this. %$* 96
you know that in the middle east they never forget. %$* 96
you can get away with this. %$* 96
do they have weapons of mass destruction? %$* 96
well as i understand, mr. %$* 96
al-libi after he was beaten up by the iraqis, by the egyptians actually, said that, saddam hussein trained al qaeda in weapons of biological and chemical destruction. %$* 96
the pentagon yesterday produced this huge report that proved that this was entirely false. %$* 96
but it went into the president’s speech in october in 2002 and it was part of the case that took us to war. %$* 96
and let me tell you, i don’t know how many lives these not- torture techniques have saved. %$* 96
but i can tell you how many lives it’s taken. %$* 96
it’s taken everybody who’s died. %$* 96
all right— %$* 92
think—think about it— %$* 96
now, wait a minute, i have to apologize, i have taken this debate out of sequence. %$* 92
and you guys are supposed to ask each other questions now, so— let me hurry up and get some of those in. %$* 92
and if you don’t mind, i’ll begin with heather. %$* 92
heather, do you have a question for the other side. %$* 92
well, i’m just puzzled by the idea that, with—if you have khalid shaikh mohammed in detention, i’m not sure what the public cooperation is that you’re going to expect to get information from him. %$* 93
the 9-11 commission report, you’re claiming that interrogation stress did not work. %$* 93
they said that half of the information in that report came from the interrogation of high- value— %$* 93
is that the question? %$* 92
yeah, how do you—why are you disagreeing with the fact that, the interrogation of high-value detainees did produce valuable intelligence that allowed us to— %$* 93
well, in—in the case of, in the case of abu zubaydah, the information that was of high value, was not stuff that he gave up after he was waterboarded. %$* 98
the real critical stuff was in the apartment where he was seized. %$* 98
he jumped out the back window and in the apartment was a treasure trove of computers, documents, cell phones and the like. %$* 98
and so when they end— started to do their routine grunt work, and do the document exploitation and all the other stuff, that’s what led ultimately to the arrest if you will or the capture of khalid shaikh, and ramzi ben al-shif %$* 98
that was jack cloonan. %$* 92
john hutson, have you got a question for the other side? %$* 92
yes, i do. %$* 94
the side in favor of the proposition? %$* 92
yes. %$* 94
there’s been a lot of talk about the army field manual and the difference now between dod and the cia.the president just recently vetoed the intelligence bill, which contained— would’ve made the cia subject to the army field manual. %$* 94
the army field manual says, “use of torture by us personnel would bring discredit upon the united states and its armed forces while undermining domestic and international support for the war effort.” not making a distinction between the cia and the army, just talking about domestic and intellectual support. %$* 94
“it could also place us and allied personnel in enemy hands at greater risk of abuse.” %$* 94
there’s a question there, right— %$* 92
well, it—there’s going to be. %$* 94
which of—now these— the army field manual, or the intelligence bill that the army field—that would’ve incorporated the army field manual, has the following prohibitions. %$* 94
which of these prohibitions would you say is okay for the cia, and therefore for the united states. %$* 94
forcing a prisoner to be naked, perform sexual acts—and this is what the president vetoed. %$* 94
forcing a prisoner to be naked, perform sexual acts or pose in a sexual manner. %$* 94
placing hoods or sacks over the head of a prisoner, using duct tape over their eyes. %$* 94
applying beatings, electric shocks, burns and other forms of physical pain, waterboarding, military working dogs, hypothermia or heat injure, mock-executions and depriving a prisoner if necessary of food, water and medical care. %$* 94
now, which of those do you think it’s okay for the cia on behalf of the united states to engage in, in order to get information. %$* 94
rick, do you wanna take that one? %$* 92
well, since i think he’s reading from my article— %$* 97
no, actually i’m not. %$* 94
that’s the field manual, right. %$* 97
it’s— well, this is what the army is prohibited from doing, i’m not saying the cia should be allowed to do any or all of these, i’m just saying you shouldn’t extend this manual to the cia, the cia operates under different rules. %$* 97
but you were— %$* 92
but do you—do you want to go through and then the cia— %$* 97
he—he’s asking—he gave you a multiple-choice question here because these were, this bill was vetoed— %$* 92
but that’s—with all due respect, john, that’s not all that the army field manual does, my favorite example is, and i wish i had it in front of me. %$* 95
if you look at the definition of a good cop versus bad cop, there’s a restriction on how bad a bad cop can be. %$* 95
the bad cop cannot act in a manner that’s disrespectful to the person being interrogated. %$* 95
i would submit to you it’s not a question of violating the law on the domestic side. %$* 95
in virtually every police station, the bad cop is pretty damn disrespectful to the drug dealers and rapists and muggers. %$* 95
we’re talking about using the rules we’re not using in our criminal justice system. %$* 95
that john is absurd, it’s insanity. %$* 95
it’s not morality— %$* 95
but he’s citing the— %$* 92
but he’s citing selectively. %$* 95
the army field manual— %$* 95
and he’s asking you to respond selectively— %$* 92
my response is i have to defend all the good police officers and law enforcement officers out there. %$* 94
because i can assure you that doesn’t go on as—as much as david suggested it does, it just doesn’t— %$* 94
what— bad cop does not yell? %$* 95
no— %$* 94
spittle is not flying— %$* 95
i’m saying that— %$* 94
threats are not made— %$* 95
but you keep— %$* 98
we’re not allowed to— %$* 93
—you keep talking—you keep talking— %$* 98
—grab somebody’s collar— %$* 93
—about these extreme views. %$* 98
you keep talking in the extreme. %$* 98
what i’m trying to argue here is and i think we’ve done it rather successfully, frankly, is to tell you— %$* 98
little bias there jack. %$* 96
—is to tell you %$* 98
is to, is to tell you, that, that when you speak in the extremes and you speak in the absolutes, that there is going to be problems. %$* 98
i don’t think you have sat across the—maybe you have, maybe you have sat across the table from one of these guys, and tried to get information. %$* 98
heather, maybe you have, i suspect that rick has, i don’t know. %$* 98
but i will tell you if you had, you’d walk away from that experience being very humble %$* 98
and understanding what you’re up against. %$* 98
to the gentleman’s question, about the moral imperative. %$* 98
if you think, ladies and gentlemen and my distinguished colleagues over here, that we can defeat this enemy, with guns and bullets, and throwing money at this, you’re wrong. %$* 98
this is an epic struggle, this is a struggle for the next generation, and it’s the biggest challenge that we’re gonna have to face. %$* 98
and i don’t want to make it any more difficult than what it is. %$* 98
and when you engage in some of the things that have been, i’m not saying some of the things that we’ve discussed here tonight, you make that challenge a lot harder for us. %$* 98
david, do you have a question— %$* 92
two very good questions— %$* 95
—david rivkin—do you— one question for the other side— %$* 92
why—all right— %$* 95
—against the motion— %$* 92
why do you claim, that false, misleading information and lying only emanates from people who are being interrogated stressfully, the last time i checked, every criminal, every terrorist routinely lies and your job as an interrogator is to sift the truth from fiction. %$* 95
isn’t it the case that the biggest problem is, when a person says nothing, zero, nada. %$* 95
not the fact that somebody’s lying because you have enough time to cross-reference things, you can learn as much from lying, as from a person doing truth- telling, but everybody lies. %$* 95
okay. %$* 92
does anybody want— %$* 92
there’s— no kidding. %$* 98
well, look, there’s lots of collection— %$* 96
bad guys—bad guys lie— %$* 95
—the question is analysis. %$* 96
look. %$* 96
the guilty will lie no more nor—nor less, the problem is a selection problem. %$* 96
you have a fuzzy context in which you can’t tell who is a big fish, who’s a small fish. %$* 96
who is al qaeda, who isn’t. %$* 96
these are people who hide as ordinary civilians, you’ve all admitted this, right? %$* 96
so you have a selection problem. %$* 96
you have to pull in large numbers of people, and there, you have to decide who is guilty and who is innocent. %$* 96
the guilty, you’re right, absolutely will lie no more or less if you do whatever you want to do to them, right? %$* 96
but the innocent, oh my god. %$* 96
if you start torturing—torturing the innocent to 20 to 78 at that rate, you’re going produce a mound of false information. %$* 96
you’re weighing down the exact war effort you want to win. %$* 96
and not only that, i ask you, what american value does it promote to torture 20 to 78 innocents to get your one hit? %$* 96
actually darius—darius, it’s your time to ask a question— %$* 92
and i just asked that question— %$* 96
do you wanna ask that? %$* 92
yeah. %$* 96
did you guys get that— %$* 92
but that’s a straw man, nobody is suggesting that this administration, much-maligned, has used— has used the stress interrogation techniques, against very few high- value detainees. %$* 95
and whether or not a given individual as jack suggested, was more of a braggart, or, versus a real mastermind. %$* 95
he wasn’t innocent, the few people who were subjected to those things were anything but innocent. %$* 95
look— %$* 96
torture is like virginity— %$* 94
i don’t think— %$* 95
—once you’ve done it %$* 94
go ahead— %$* 95
—you’re torturer. %$* 94
you know, it’s a one-time deal, if we, it’s not necessary counting, or saying, well %$* 94
these people above these lines are high-values, so we can torture them, below this line, they’re not, so, you know, once you’ve done it, once you’ve engaged in it, that’s who you are as a nation. %$* 94
john, we’re not talking— %$* 95
and you’ve got to— %$* 94

well, you know what? %$* 75
one of those two little terrorist networks killed 3,000 people down the street from here, 19 men with box cutters. %$* 75
this is a real threat. %$* 75
these people are out there every day trying to kill us. %$* 75
and i think it's really shameful to dismiss them as two little terrorist networks. %$* 75
khalid sheikh mohammed was captured in pakistan. %$* 75
you said unless he's in iraq or afghanistan, he's not an enemy combatant. %$* 75
so do you consider can a lead sheik mohammed an enemy combatant, the master mind of 9/11, the man who commanded the operation, the operational commander of al-qaeda? %$* 75
is he an enemy combatant, yes or no? %$* 75
how do you know that he is the mastermind of 9/11? %$* 76
what-- %$* 76
oh, my god. %$* 75
he has not been put on trial. %$* 76
and you don't want to put him on trial. %$* 76
and you are denying those 3,000 victims-- %$* 76
i'm not denying them anything. %$* 75
you are denying-- %$* 76
you say it's not important to have a trial. %$* 76
i say it is important to have a trial. %$* 76
it's not the first priority. %$* 75
it is important to establish the truth of what happened and for people to get some closure. %$* 76
and it's important for these people to be punished. %$* 76
i do not in any way diminish the seriousness of 9/11.and i agree with general hayden that these are difficult decisions. %$* 76
and i am not sure that i would want to be in the position he was in of having to make those. %$* 76
but what i will tell you is that the oath that we take, that we both took as officers in the united states military is to defend the constitution of the united states. %$* 76
it is not to defend the people of the united states. %$* 76
because what we are defending are our values and our history. %$* 76
and sometimes, yes, it may cost lives. %$* 76
but you cannot achieve perfect security. %$* 76
and when you try to, by making shortcuts, you ultimately diminish us as a country. %$* 76
and it does not serve us in the long run. %$* 76
yes from the-- %$* 13
the blue jacket and white-- %$* 13
blue shirt and dark blue blazer. %$* 13
yep. %$* 13
your colleague is tapping you on the shoulder. %$* 13
could you just wait for the microphone? %$* 13
and again, to keep it as a question and-- %$* 13
my name is les shelton, and my question is that-- %$* 18
comes from the fact that it seems that what was really most difficult is what is the definition, operationally of a person whose terrorist that talking how can we be sure that a terrorist on a bus in pakistan and the whole bus is grabbed because they know a terrorist is on the bus. %$* 18
and how do we understand, as people listening to all this, how we can feel comfortable with the shortcut because nobody wants their ass burned. %$* 18
and the fact of the matter is we need to feel a bit more-- %$* 18
i need to feel a bit more comfortable about the selection process for applying these definitions is somehow rational. %$* 18
and i have to say that our legal system is one of the ways those things are done. %$* 18
but again, we have a group of people who say they're experts. %$* 18
and they know these people are. %$* 18
but we have a bad history. %$* 18
that isn't always the case. %$* 18
sir, can you cut to your question. %$* 13
the question is how do we make this distinction so that all of us can feel more comfortable with what our government may be doing? %$* 18
you mean the distinction who are the terrorists and who is not? %$* 13
yeah. %$* 18
you know, how to get the innocents off the bus. %$* 18
how and who? %$* 13
i mean, there is also the question of who makes the distinction as well. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 18
let's take that to the side for the motion. %$* 13
mike, go ahead. %$* 13
it's a process. %$* 77
it's a rigorous process. %$* 77
i governed it while i was the director of cia with regard to that portion of the war that cia had responsibility for. %$* 77
to be clear, just being a terrorist doesn't get much interest from us. %$* 77
the authorization we have from the congress and the authorization for the use of military force is against al-qaeda and its affiliates. %$* 77
so it's not a global terrorist issue. %$* 77
we are at war with a select group of terrorists. %$* 77
president obama has made that clear. %$* 77
the congress has made that clear. %$* 77
president bush has made that clear. %$* 77
we used same criteria to capture an individual as a terrorist that we use on the battlefield to kill. %$* 77
it is visual who is a terrorist. %$* 77
i am responding to the political processes of the american state. %$* 77
all three branches of government have said we are at war. %$* 77
i'm using the full authority given to me. %$* 77
i use it in the clearest conscience i have. %$* 77
are mistakes made on the battlefield? %$* 77
killing, capturing? %$* 77
of course, they are. %$* 77
what-- %$* 77
you have very good men and women working very hard to apply absolute precision to their task. %$* 77
now, i will admit that the processes of intelligence are a bit different than the processes of the judicial system. %$* 77
again, as i mentioned in the one habeas case, we had to fold our tent and admit defeat because i could not, in conscience, tell the enemy combatant who the source of our information was. %$* 77
if i did that, i would quickly not have sources of information anywhere in the world. %$* 77
and so we had to make a serious tradeoff. %$* 77
that's what i mean by putting this into a law enforcement template, rather than using a vigorous and consistent with the rule of law, law of armed conflict. %$* 77
thank you, michael hayden. %$* 13
go ahead and take one more question. %$* 13
there is-- %$* 13
on the far aisle, almost near the top. %$* 13
yes. %$* 13
up seven steps. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 19
i think my question is for general hayden. %$* 19
you and your partner have admitted that mistakes are sometimes made as to who does get picked up as a terrorist. %$* 19
in the civilian justice system, we say it's something of a cliché, that it's better for 100 guilty men to walk free than to convict an innocent man unjustly. %$* 19
what's your calculation in the war on terror? %$* 19
how many non-terrorists can be rendered off the streets of toronto or amsterdam to make it okay? %$* 19
obviously there's no precise answer to the question. %$* 77
michael hayden. %$* 13
we do the very best we can. %$* 77
and we review our data constantly. %$* 77
as i mentioned, to david's point-- %$* 77
and he’s nodding in agreement because he's familiar with the process. %$* 77
we have combatant status review teams even before we had the habeas process at guantanamo. %$* 77
you go over the evidence routinely. %$* 77
it's required by our regulations. %$* 77
it's required by the regime that's in place at guantanamo. %$* 77
i hope the audience is not demanding 100 percent certitude and 100 percent perfection before your intelligence services or your military services can act in your defense. %$* 77
and that concludes round two of our debate. %$* 13
we are about to hear closing statements from each debater. %$* 13
there will be two minutes, each. %$* 13
this is their last chance to change your mind. %$* 13
you will be asked to vote once again immediately after they speak and to pick the winner in this debate just a few minutes from now. %$* 13
our motion is "treat enemy terrorists like-- %$* 13
" excuse me-- %$* 13
our motion is "treat terrorists like enemy combatants, not criminals." and first, to summarize his position against the motion, stephen jones, who served as principal defense counsel for oklahoma city bomber timothy mcveigh. %$* 13
as we have listened to the debate tonight, i think two or three issues have emerged sharply. %$* 78
the issue is not just about the treatment of individuals at guantanamo bay. %$* 78
the issue is larger and that is, what is the system we will use to adjudicate the guilt of those persons charged with crimes against the united states. %$* 78
and i say that the line is indivisible. %$* 78
by that i mean you cannot say, "we have one set of justice over here for these categories of crimes, that one rule of evidence, one rule of procedure, one rule of appellate practice, and over here we have an entirely different rule of evidence and a different procedure.” first, that leaves the intelligence community who are largely anonymous and many law enforcement officers and prosecutors unaccountable in the final analysis for the decision made. %$* 78
general hayden has been very correct in telling you that there is not 100 percent perfection and there isn't. %$* 78
after all, the 9/11 commission in its report talked about the system was blinking red, so our intelligence and many of our law enforcement officials and indeed political leaders knew of the risks and did nothing. %$* 78
in the final analysis, accountability for responsible decisions has to be made somewhere, political process, the legal process, something done openly, but that is not what the argument is made by our colleagues to our right. %$* 78
their argument is trust us, trust us, we'll get it right this time. %$* 78
unfortunately history shows too many examples of not getting it right. %$* 78
that's why we have the rule of law. %$* 78
thank you, stephen jones. %$* 13
for the motion to treat terrorists like enemy combatants, not criminals, and summarizing his position for this motion, marc thiessen, a columnist for the washington post, a fellow at the american enterprise institute, and former speechwriter for president george w. bush. %$* 13
we did get it right. %$* 75
in the period in the eight years before september 11th, 2001, al- qaeda killed roughly 3,500 people in a series of attacks starting with the 1993 world trade center bombing, followed by the attack on our embassies in kenya and tanzania, followed by the-- %$* 75
or the attack on the uss cole and culminating in september 11th, 2001.that was when we followed the law enforcement approach to interrogation. %$* 75
during that period of time, we prosecuted 29 people in connection with those attacks. %$* 75
if you think that is an approach-- %$* 75
and we didn't get the intelligence we needed to stop the september 11th terrorist attacks, in the period that followed we have not been hit again. %$* 75
so it's a very stark question; do you want to go back to the approach when al-qaeda was mounting attacks of increasingly lethality, or do you want to follow the approach that we took which has kept this country safe for almost a decade? %$* 75
our opponents are trying to wiggle out of it. %$* 75
they want you to-- %$* 75
focus you on waterboarding and the interrogation techniques. %$* 75
if they don't like the techniques we used, there's a wide line between waterboarding on one hand and "you have the right to remain silent," lawful techniques that can be used short of that. %$* 75
choose other techniques, but what their position holds, if you hold that a terrorist is a criminal and not an enemy combatant, we cannot kill them using predator drones outside of the war zones of iraq and afghanistan. %$* 75
we cannot kill them in pakistan. %$* 75
we cannot kill them in yemen. %$* 75
we cannot kill them in east africa. %$* 75
there are terrorists plotting to attack us right now that barack obama would not be allowed to kill. %$* 75
and second, we will not be able to interrogate them effectively as we found out after the christmas day bomber, as we found out with the times square bomber. %$* 75
so this is a very stark question. %$* 75
do you want to go back to the approach that led to 3,500 american people getting killed and we were not able to get the intelligence to stop the attack. %$* 75
or do you want to follow the approach that kept our country safe for almost a decade. %$* 75
thank you, marc thiessen. %$* 13
the motion is “treat terrorists like enemy combatants, not criminals,” and summarizing his position against this motion, david frakt, a lieutenant colonel in the air force reserve, jag corps who served as lead defense counsel with the office of military commissions. %$* 13
our opponents seem to have valued american lives more than the lives of anybody else. %$* 76
they seem to forget about madrid, about london, about bali. %$* 76
the terrorists have not stopped. %$* 76
but simply because we’ve tightened security domestically and presented easy targets overseas, the action is moved overseas. %$* 76
we are not safer today than we were on september 12th, 2001.we are in a worse position because of our actions in the war on terror, our lawlessness and our abandonment of the rule of law. %$* 76
general hayden talks a lot about the rule of law and serving it but that was not really our experience under the prior administration. %$* 76
let me tell you about my personal experience. %$* 76
i was assigned to represent two detainees in guantanamo. %$* 76
both had been determined to be enemy combatants in the combatant status tribunals that you heard about. %$* 76
but in fact, neither was an enemy combatant. %$* 76
one, mr. %$* 76
ali hamza al bahlul was, in fact, a terrorist. %$* 76
he was an al qaeda insider. %$* 76
he was a media advisor and created propaganda for al qaeda. %$* 76
he should have been tried in federal court for material support in terrorism. %$* 76
he was not an operational terrorist. %$* 76
he did not kill any americans. %$* 76
he did not plot any attacks on americans. %$* 76
the other was neither an enemy combatant nor a terrorist and, in fact, he was a child who had been tortured into confessing to something he didn’t do. %$* 76
a lot of mistakes were made. %$* 76
the rule of law was not observed. %$* 76
over time, with the intervention of the supreme court, we gradually brought the pendulum back to something approaching equilibrium. %$* 76
but they’re advocating going back. %$* 76
i’m advocating going forward. %$* 76
so we urge you to vote against the proposition. %$* 76
thank you. %$* 76
thank you, david frakt. %$* 13
our motion is “treat terrorists as enemy combatants, not criminals,” and to summarize for the motion, our final speaker, michael hayden, former cia director and the country’s first principal deputy director of national intelligence and the former director of the nsa. %$* 13
as i predicted and somewhat feared, we’ve sidled into a discussion as to whether or not you are for or against the rule of law. %$* 77
i warned you that that was not the issue here, that there is plenty of law with the laws of conflict to govern our behavior and the american armed forces, the american intelligence community are quite capable and competent to function within that framework. %$* 77
i was taken aback a little bit by saying that the intelligence community is not accountable. %$* 77
clearly stephen has never been in front of the senate select committee or the house permanent select committee on intelligence and to go through the openness that we share within the confines of those committees. %$* 77
i was struck as stephen said the system was blinking red and i think he was alleging some sort of incompetence. %$* 77
the attack still happened in the summer in september of 2001. the attack still happened not because the intelligence was wanting-- %$* 77
although certainly you can always use better intelligence. %$* 77
the act took place because the model we were using, the model in which we placed the intelligence which was a law enforcement model. %$* 77
the difference between now and 9/11 is that we are a nation at war and we are taking the fight to the enemy. %$* 77
there’s an office in cia, most operational office that we have on our langley campus, responsible for many of the things the current administration is taking credit for. %$* 77
you walk into that office you hit a bulkhead, a wall, and there’s a sign there saying today’s date and you walk by it, very often don’t recognize it but every now and again you catch it. %$* 77
it actually says today’s date is september 12th, 2001.it’s been up there for over eight years. %$* 77
when i was director and got in a car and drove down g.w.parkway to my home, it didn't feel like september 12th. %$* 77
it felt a lot like september 10th. %$* 77
that's an attitude that we adopt at our peril. %$* 77
thank you. %$* 77
thank you, michael. %$* 13
that concludes our closing statements. %$* 13
and now it's time to learn which side argued best. %$* 13
i'm going to ask you, once again, to vote. %$* 13
go to those key pads at your seat that will register your vote. %$* 13
and we will get the readout and the results almost instantaneously. %$* 13
our motion is “treat terrorists like enemy combatants, not criminals.” if you agree with the motion, push number one. %$* 13
if you disagree, push number two. %$* 13
if you are undecided or became undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and you can ignore the other numbers. %$* 13
and if you want to correct your entry, go ahead and do so, and it'll lock in the latest one. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13
it will be a while, no? %$* 13
or did you did you get persuaded to go to the other side? %$* 13
i think not. %$* 13
i was undecided before, but i'm definitely against now. %$* 76
i'm going to have the results in just a moment. %$* 13
i think we've locked out the system. %$* 13
and i just want to-- %$* 13
first of all, when i said-- %$* 13
when i was going to say the rubber hit the road, it's rare that we actually-- %$* 13
and i know that it's in your car. %$* 13
but that we actually came to a kind of moment i think of really essential truth about the difference between the two sides. %$* 13
and it was-- %$* 13
i applaud both sides for going to that point and for a very, very spirited debate from both teams today. %$* 13
and the questions from the audience, including with the rhetorical flourish from west point, we're quite good, quite on point and better than we normally get. %$* 13
so i want to thank you for those as well. %$* 13
this is only the first of our five-part debate series throughout the fall. %$* 13

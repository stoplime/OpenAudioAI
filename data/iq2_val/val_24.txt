we’ve incarcerated— %$* 127
rounded them up? %$* 129
muslims in america without trial? %$* 127
rounded, rounded them up? %$* 129
name one? %$* 129
nonsense. %$* 127
name one instance. %$* 129
the, belabor me all day with lists of people who have vanished. %$* 128
vanished. %$* 128
you know— %$* 129
well, that— %$* 127
this is on the border of lunacy, with all due respect. %$* 129
but you didn't need to do it, you didn't need to do it— %$* 128
we didn't do it! %$* 129
all right, let’s come back to some questions. %$* 13
hang on, hang on here. %$* 126
you didn't need guantanamo bay. %$* 128
i see down in, down in the front row, there— %$* 13
you’ve got the world believing america is a less robust place, and it really is. %$* 128
now, what part of the world is that? %$* 127
is that— %$* 127
you— %$* 128
china and india? %$* 127
do they have %$* 127
i'm serious. %$* 127
no. %$* 128
let’s talk about “the world.” %$* 127
yeah, yeah. %$* 128
the world turns out to be a certain class of liberal elites in western europe. %$* 127
not all of western %$* 127
it does, it does! %$* 127
is bush %$* 127
is america unpopular? %$* 127
has anyone here been, is america unpopular in east asia? %$* 127
is america unpopular, has bush’s policy towards china been terrible in terms of chinese views? %$* 127
have we had a, india is a great success story, a rather important, huge democracy, for bush. %$* 127
even in western europe, when bush took over, there were rather anti-american prime ministers, democratically elected obviously, in france and in germany— %$* 127
it’s just not true. %$* 128
or at least skeptical of america. %$* 127
then merkel wins in germany, and sarkozy wins in france. %$* 127
if they're so, if america’s image is so ruined, if they just can't stand america, why did they elect the more pro-american candidate in both of those races? %$* 127
i want to go to questions. %$* 13
first row? %$* 13
and you know i don’t want to be biased against folks in the back just because i can't see them, if you can be a little horizontal. %$* 13
ah! %$* 13
all the way in the rear, blue shirt? %$* 13
i want to collect your question in the front row, and then you’ll be— %$* 13
well, i hate to disrupt that exchange, but question for mr. %$* 9
rove and mr. %$* 9
kristol, who is the worst president of the last fifty years and why? %$* 9
one second. %$* 13
let’s see what we have in the back. %$* 13
the statement has been made that we have been made safer since, because of president bush’s administration since september 11th. %$* 9
if he is to receive credit, is he to receive blame for not protecting us from september 11th? %$* 9
ok, i want to take a third one from about eight rows up, and three rows, three seats over. %$* 13
question for misters kristol and rove. %$* 9
in the last fifty years this administration has been by far the biggest spending administration with the possible exception of lyndon johnson. %$* 9
can, sir, can we ask you to start the question again? %$* 13
thank— %$* 13
in the last fifty years, this administration has been by far the biggest spending administration with the possible exception of lyndon johnson, and that’s even before spending on homeland security and iraq. %$* 9
what is your response to that. %$* 9
ok, i want to go to the second question first. %$* 13
on the question of september 11th, does president bush deserve any blame for september 11th? %$* 13
we published in the weekly standard of, in july of 2001 an article by reuel marc gerecht, who i think has participated in these debates, alarmed that we were not doing enough to fight al qaeda, that they had bombed the uss cole in october of 2000, and that neither the bush administration, nor the congress, the democrats, republicans, really understood how serious the threat of al qaeda was. %$* 127
i think the bush administration would say, i mean, i think conde rice and others have said this, that they now wish, of course, they had been more alarmed and more alert as they had taken office in those first few months. %$* 127
so yes, there is blame to go around on 9/11. but fundamentally, the growth of al qaeda, the ability of al qaeda, which was key to have the terror training camps unmolested in afghanistan, is not something that primarily happened under bush. %$* 127
can we just, one more word on this, because if you read richard clarke’s book, or some of the other inside accounts of this, it’s clear, it’s not that nobody had heard of al qaeda, richard clarke, for example, was running around with his hair on fire about how dangerous this threat was. %$* 126
and it’s clear that bush, in the early days, downplayed it, rejected it, didn't take it seriously, and did so because it had been a particular focus of the clinton administration, and he was reversing policy. %$* 126
the focus %$* 127
if it was such a focus of the clinton administration, it would be nice to know what they did about it, since— %$* 127
well they %$* 126
richard clarke himself— %$* 127
they launched missile strikes— %$* 126
well, they launched one series— %$* 127
on osama bin laden— %$* 126
one series of— %$* 127
they missed. %$* 126
bush hasn’t got him either. %$* 126
they started a little later. %$* 126
anyway %$* 126
a question you were asked, who is the worst president of the last fifty years? %$* 13
look, i mean this is a, you know, this is why this question is a little artificial. %$* 127
i mean, lyndon johnson probably made the worst mistake, perhaps, of the last fifty years, with vietnam, but he also deserves a huge amount of credit, i think, and i’ll say this as a conservative and a republican, some of what he did in terms of, certainly, civil rights, and i would say something like medicare. %$* 127
so, people are not, you know, univocally good or bad. %$* 127
i do think, at the same time, personal, corruption of the political system for political, of the judicial system, and of the governmental system for political ends, clearly nixon. %$* 127
and i would say in terms of just incompetence and leaving the country in dangerous shape which had to be reversed, carter. %$* 127
so, the seventies was a bad decade, in my opinion, for american presidents, and for america, and for the world. %$* 127
which was reversed by reagan. %$* 127
karl rove, we had a questioner say that president bush was a big spender. %$* 13
yeah, look, i like how first of all you did put, say put aside homeland security. %$* 129
let’s take a look at discretionary domestic spending. %$* 129
the last budget left to us, the fy ’01 budget, left to us by that previous president whose name you can fill in, increased discretionary domestic spending in fy ’01 fifteen percent in one year. %$* 129
that means that would double the discretionary spending of the federal government, if left at that rate, in five and a half years. %$* 129
we cut, in our first budget, fy ’02, discretionary domestic spending to seven percent, in fy ’03 to four percent, in fy ’04, excuse me, fy ’05, two percent, and six, seven, and eight, have flat lined discretionary domestic spending of the government. %$* 129
been hard to do. %$* 129
we’re going to leave a big, we’re going to leave an enormous benefit in place for barack obama in that we have flat lined discretionary domestic spending. %$* 129
and the biggest, and the biggest spending item is, are two things, the tax cuts, we can debate economic policy, but i think an awful lot of people think especially 2003 tax cuts were sensible and ended up producing, actually, a lot of revenue. %$* 127
and prescription drug benefit, which i would defend as a conservative. %$* 127
medicare exists, it is a pretty good program, it had to be improved, it had to be updated by bringing prescription drugs into it. %$* 127
it’s come in under budget, and i think, what, ninety-two percent of seniors are covered, and it seems to be working pretty well. %$* 127
now, if you're a strict, small government libertarian conservative, you would object to bush starting a new entitlement program, and that’s a defensible, philosophical position, but in that case, the biggest domestic expenditure, the biggest piece of domestic legislation of the bush administration, it did what bush said it was going to do. %$* 127
i'm collecting questions again, from the upper left where the camera is. %$* 13
john, could i add a little bit of that to, to— %$* 129
i want to move on, karl, because your colleague covered it quite well. %$* 13
he did. %$* 129
yes, sir? %$* 13
hello, my question is for mister %$* 9
your, i think your mic might have cut out, at least it did to the hall here. %$* 13
can you try again? %$* 13
jenkins %$* 9
weisberg. %$* 9
before 9/11 terrorism was viewed as a criminal act, let’s investigate, let’s get the bad guys. %$* 9
in my opinion— %$* 9
sir, i apologize because we’ve got the camera with you, and the mic is malfunctioning, and another one is on its way to you. %$* 13
while that’s happening, i'm going to go to a question down front row center. %$* 13
yes, for mr. %$* 9
rove. %$* 9
had the— %$* 9
wait, i'm sorry, do you need the shot? %$* 13
you're good? %$* 13
ok. %$* 13
mister— %$* 9
i'm sorry, we, we’re not quite ready. %$* 13
ok.we can't hear you also. %$* 13
ok. try again. %$* 13
had %$* 9
i just want to ask our broadcast side if they heard that, because i know i didn't. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
here it comes. %$* 13
the question is for mr. %$* 9
rove. %$* 9
had the intelligence been accurate prior to the invasion of iraq, would the invasion have still taken place, in your view? %$* 9
no. %$* 129
in the aftermath of 9/11 the concern was about a tyrant guilty of enormous human rights abuses, but possessed with weapons of mass destruction and an intention to use them as a state sponsor of terror. %$* 129
absent that, i suspect the administration’s course would have been to work to find more creative ways to constrain him than he’d been constrained in the nineties. %$* 129
the president did have an enormous concern about the human rights abuses under saddam hussein. %$* 129
he also had a concern about the deterioration of the credibility of the united nations, which had passed sixteen resolutions calling upon him to abide by the outcome and the agreements that he made in the aftermath of the ’91, of the first gulf war, that he’d not lived up to. %$* 129
but absent weapons of mass destruction, no, i don’t think there would have been an invasion. %$* 129
ok, are we set for the question up in the corner up here yet? %$* 13
and otherwise i’ll come up the aisle, if you can come up the aisle, red sweater. %$* 13
let’s wait till the camera reaches you. %$* 13
very good, very patient. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 9
my question is for mr. %$* 9
rove. %$* 9
what is the future of the party? %$* 9
specifically in terms of diversifying the party? %$* 9
as we’ve seen, that was the biggest issue next to the economy. %$* 9
can you please talk on that issue. %$* 9
ok, let’s hold that question and collect a couple more, just because we’re having this microphone problem. %$* 13
the young lady of two rows down, eyeglasses. %$* 13
this is for mr. %$* 10
jenkins and mr. %$* 10
weisberg. %$* 10
you’ve criticized president bush for going to war with iraq. %$* 10
if president bush had not decided to go to war with iraq and had only decided to go to war with afghanistan to fight terrorism, do you think saddam hussein would have, a, remained a neutral and impartial observer in the war between islamic terrorists and the west; b, allied with the united states in an effort to stamp out islamic terrorists and bring democracy to afghanistan; or c, grown a dangerous supporter and protector of islamic terrorists, including al qaeda and others. %$* 10
simon and jacob, why don’t you take that. %$* 13
we have a problem here. %$* 128
i just don’t see terrorism as a state projected force in the way that you do. %$* 128
i regard it in the sense that the question was trying to ask before, as a criminal act of gangsters roaming the world, and badly in need of curtailing by their own governments. %$* 128
i think the way we treated international terrorism is to glorify it, to give it the status of a state. %$* 128
we’ve given huge recruiting energy to those people who want to bring young people into this particular odious fold, and i think by declaring war on some governments, i may say not all governments that harbor them, we’ve accorded them a status wholly beyond what they deserve. %$* 128
i believe that my country and your country’s overstated this threat. %$* 128
i just think we’ve overdone it. %$* 128
and in overdoing it, we turned very large numbers of countries in the, particularly in the islamic world, into state menaces. %$* 128
they themselves are undermined by the status we’ve given to these people. %$* 128
pakistan being a classic case of that. %$* 128
this is quite a cosmic question. %$* 128
if you declare a very small group of people to be an international menace, you turn them into a sort of hero, and we’ve done that, and it’s been a terrible, terrible mistake. %$* 128
jacob? %$* 13
mr. %$* 126
rove mentioned somewhere in that incredible litany of distortions that %$* 126
that i was in favor of getting rid of saddam hussein. %$* 126
i was, as were a lot of sensible people. %$* 126
i didn't happen to favor doing it the way bush did, largely unilaterally, rejecting allies, as opposed to building pressure on saddam, and not waiting for the inspection process to play out. %$* 126
but i think the point is, and what we’ve subsequently learned, and the problem i had that bush didn't have, was i did not have access to analysts from the department of energy trying to tell everybody that those aluminum tubes were not for nuclear weapons. %$* 126
but the point is that saddam was being, had been successfully disarmed, and was being successfully contained, and he was not supporting international terrorism, because he was afraid to. %$* 126
he was a miscalculator, a serial miscalculator, but he was not a mad man, and i think he understood very clearly that supporting terrorism against the united states would have resulted in the same thing that happened anyway, his destruction. %$* 126
i think what would have happened if we didn't invade iran, i’d actually like to turn the question around a little bit and ask bill kristol, for example, does he, knowing what we know now, still think invading iraq would make sense? %$* 126
but i think that we might have ended up having to take military action against saddam hussein at some point in the future. %$* 126
but i think we could have done it with allies, i think we could have done it in a more thought out way, and i think we could have planned for an occupation, it could have been expected if we knew we were going to have to do it. %$* 126
bill, i think that question to you was more than rhetorical, but i want you to take twenty seconds to answer it. %$* 13
i think karl is right that we, that the president would not, in fact, have gone to war if he had known what seems to be the case, that saddam had no real functioning weapons of mass destruction programs at the time. %$* 127
i, having said that, so i think as an analytical manner karl’s certainly right, the american political system wouldn't have supported it. %$* 127
now, i think it was right to go to war to remove saddam. %$* 127
i think the middle east would be incredibly much more dangerous if he were, or his sons were in power. %$* 127
i think every radical state and every radical group would be empowered, because weakness is what empowers them, and he would have stood, stood down, in effect, the us, and the un, and the civilized world. %$* 127
it’s inconceivable we could have kept the sanctions up. %$* 127
they were already fraying. %$* 127
it’s inconceivable, the inspectors were only in because we moved a hundred and fifty thousand troops next door. %$* 127
they would have gone out, it would have been a horrible defeat for the west, and i think it would have, we would have had a much more resurgent radicalism in the islamic world than we have today, where i think it’s a mixed bag, that actually in many respects the terrorist groups are on the defensive and on the run. %$* 127
karl rove, you had a question %$* 13
you had a question, karl rove, about the future of the party particularly in its ability to be more diverse. %$* 13
well, after a loss, every political party goes through a period of introspection and rebuilding, and republicans have to do that this time. %$* 129
let’s be clear, though, about what happened in this election, and that is that barack obama got three point one percent more than al gore got in 2000.this is not the blow out that you might expect given the conditions of the economy and the unpopularity of the war. %$* 129
this was not a sixty/forty victory. %$* 129
he got fifty-three percent of the vote. %$* 129
he got seven point one million more votes than john kerry got, and four out of every five were black or brown. %$* 129
and therein lies the challenge for the republican party. %$* 129
the party of lincoln needs to make a concerted appeal for african-american votes, knowing that in the short term it is going to pay off not one twit, and in the long run, it has a moral obligation as a great political party to represent all americans. %$* 129
and it can only do that by making the case to african-americans and latinos. %$* 129
and republicans have a similar problem brewing among latinos. %$* 129
george bush got forty-four percent of the vote among latinos, john mccain, who was a courageous, early advocate of immigration reform, got thirty-one. %$* 129
we cannot take the largest, fastest growing minority in america and write it off like we did with african-americans. %$* 129
and then we also have a problem with the young, because let’s be candid, the war has turned young voters, eighteen to twenty-nine, against the war. %$* 129
they voted for obama by two to one, and they not only were against the war, they're against the republicans. %$* 129
and those three republicans have got to work on. %$* 129
but, on the other hand, republicans had a victory, had a defeat this year that was not the blowout, and it was also the victory for obama that was not as big as anticipated. %$* 129
i, take, for example, ronald reagan in 1980, when he got elected, he brought in a hundred state senators with him, net, and three hundred members of state houses. %$* 129
this time around barack obama brought in a net of ten state senators, and ninety-four house members. %$* 129
this was an individual victory for a charismatic, articulate, inspiring individual, an historical figure, and the democrats are going to make a mistake if they think this is some kind of gigantic swing toward their party. %$* 129
we’re heading down the home stretch from questions from the audience. %$* 13
where the mic is positioned now, and the camera, and halfway up to the left, the red sleeve. %$* 13
i'm sorry, because i'm rather blinded by the lights, i'm seeing the colors of sleeves. %$* 13
i’ll take you over there first. %$* 13
ok, as i tried to say before, my question is for mister jenkins or weisberg. %$* 9
some will say that george w. bush’s most difficult decision, and maybe most courageous, is to treat  %$* 9
and not a criminal act. %$* 9
i ask you, we’ve had decades to judge these, please name me the difficult and courageous decisions made by lyndon baines johnson and jimmy carter that have been proven to be the right ones, please. %$* 9
all right, and up here? %$* 13
mr. %$* 10
jenkins, i watched prime minister’s questions on wednesday morning. %$* 10
and the uk outlawed anchor babies as a way to curb illegal immigration. %$* 10
do you think that would work here in america, and what does the panelists think? %$* 10
i'm going to, i'm going to pass on that question, i'm afraid, because it’s actually not on our topic tonight, with respect, but thank you very much. %$* 13
and i want to ask the cameraman to pivot to his right, and there’s a man in a blue shirt. %$* 13
to simon and jacob, how would you describe bush’s prosecution of the iraq war and his rationale for the iraq war, versus the rationale and prosecution of the vietnam war by jfk, lbj, and nixon— %$* 9
all right, it’s— %$* 13
and what differences do you see in how those two conflicts have been resolved? %$* 9
it seems as though those two questions actually come together, so i'm going to go for a third one, the gentleman whom i can see clearly in the bright light with his hand up. %$* 13
hold on, one moment. %$* 13
ok. %$* 13
just one simple question, first of all, thank you all for coming here. %$* 9
i'm curious, if an aspect of the success of the bush presidency is his foreign policy, and his defending us against the, terrorism, then how do you explain the fact that no one has caught osama bin laden at this point, the chief architect of the act that set all this off? %$* 9
karl rove? %$* 13
because he is hiding in a deep, dark cave in a very dark corner of, in all likelihood, pakistan. %$* 129
and, to suggest that not every effort has been made to get him is inaccurate. %$* 129
every effort has been made to get him, to get at his communications, to get at his allies, to get at his subordinates, to get at his inner circle. %$* 129
a lot of them are dead %$* 129
and we aren’t hearing much from him. %$* 129
and %$* 129
but we gotta recognize we’re dealing with an odd part of the world, this is not as simon alluded to, this is not a state. %$* 129
and it operates through states, the taliban controlled a state, afghanistan, that harbored and trained and gave succor to these terrorists. %$* 129
but they live in a odd and dark part of the world that is not a state, and it’s what makes destroying al-qaeda’s leadership and our relationship with pakistan both two very problematic things. %$* 129
simon and jacob, you had two questions along the lines of comparisons of george bush to both presidents kennedy and johnson, with i think the implication that, the president’s iraq was their vietnam, can you take on that question? %$* 13
when i was a very young journalist, was in vietnam at the very end of that war, and attended the relevant briefings, and this is not a—a very well-informed comment but, my view was that the vietnam war and occupation of south vietnam, was far more competently executed than the occupation of iraq. %$* 128
the occupation of iraq, was, and i followed american and british occupation troops around the world for most of my career—the occupation of iraq was simply the most incompetent thing i’ve ever seen. %$* 128
it was stupefyingly incompetent %$* 128
and i’ve no doubt at all that many people possibly on the platform wouldn’t disagree with that, because it was conducted by a very small group of people, against the advice of a much larger group of people within the administration. %$* 128
it simply has been a catastrophe. %$* 128
afghanistan is much better conducted, although i think it’s a much more difficult war to fight. %$* 128
and that’s why i think it’s gonna end in greater tears than iraq will end, iraq is fairly simple to end, you just leave. %$* 128
it’ll be very, very difficult to leave afghanistan. %$* 128
but certainly in vietnam, i think you had on the whole relatively competent military people there, they had experience in korea many of them. %$* 128
they lost but they only just lost. %$* 128
i do think that america could’ve stabilized south vietnam had it stayed longer. %$* 128
it was not the right place to be and the right thing to do, but it was not a hopeless case. %$* 128
i think when you go into a country without a good reason, or with the purpose of simply punishing the country as was the case in both iraq and afghanistan, you’re not likely to do well, because you haven’t really plotted what the purpose of the exercise is, it was simply to punish. %$* 128
and i think it’s that punitive element that’s been the problem, certainly in iraq. %$* 128
and i am sorry i’ve been there only twice, but i cannot accept that it is in any sense of the word a success. %$* 128
jacob? %$* 13
just on a— sorry to step on your well-deserved applause, simon. %$* 126
the %$* 126
just on lbj, the questioner asked what courageous thing did he ever do, just for starters, how about saying goodbye to the south for the democratic party for generations, when he signed the civil rights act in ’64 and the voting rights act in ’65.johnson knew that would be the political consequence of that decision and he did it anyway, to me that’s almost the definition of political courage. %$* 126
on judgement however i don’t think johnson does so well in vietnam and it’s quite comparable to bush, i think— i think both of them were very poor—i think both of them were essentially unable to admit error, to recognize error, and to reverse error. %$* 126
and, whereas johnson a slightly different story, and you know, you get into sort of psychological territory here but, johnson clearly didn’t trust kennedy’s advisors. %$* 126
he had this longstanding issue with the kennedy brothers and i think he was getting some good advice from some of the kennedy people, but i think he couldn’t hear it because of who was giving it. %$* 126
and likewise with bush on iraq, certainly the advice he got from colin powell at the very beginning not to invade iraq was very good advice. %$* 126
but i think bush was so blinded by his own motives, whatever you think they were, that i think he effectively couldn’t hear that. %$* 126
and then he couldn’t hear the very good advice that i said came from bill kristol, among other people that the strategy was failing and— you know, it finally took just a series, i mean it got to the point really where there was a total consensus that the strategy was failed, and that rumsfeld was failing and i think bush postponed change until there was absolutely no choice. %$* 126
okay, we’re coming down to our last few minutes of questions and i would like to make it a little bit forward-looking and i just wanna see if any of the hands up here are—have questions related to what president-elect obama inherits from bush, is anybody thinking along those lines quite clearly, and don’t snooker me because i’ll squash your question if it’s %$* 13
gentleman with the— gentleman with the stubble. %$* 13
that’s what it is. %$* 13
i think we all know that this issue won’t really be decided here tonight but it very well may be in 12 years, in 16 years, in 20 years. %$* 9
for those against the motion, can you paint us a picture of the world that would make your case? %$* 9
yeah. %$* 129
iraq as a functioning semi- democracy in the heart of the middle east, as an example, that would be a powerful antidote to the terrorist image of what the future oughta be like. %$* 129
afghanistan stabilized, a continued decline in the ability of terrorist elements like al-qaeda to threaten the west. %$* 129
a continued diminution in their ability to recruit, which incidentally i think you may have seen or heard about the new report out which shows a dramatic decline in their operational capability and in their recruitment ability. %$* 129
and a world where the institutions that the president is seeking to leave in place, like pepfar and the millennium challenge have revolutionized and changed america’s pattern of foreign assistance to focus on results, and transparency and accountability. %$* 129
and new institutions whether it is the replacement for kyoto with the g8 agreement this year to pursue a new international regime in which all the major emitters are at the table, and all the major emitters are focused on energy efficiency and technological advances that allow them to clean the air and reduce greenhouse gases, like we have done, we’re the only economy, the last year for which numbers are available are 2006, there’s only one industrialized economy in the world that grows that year, and reduces the absolute level of greenhouse gases, it’s the united states of america because of the approach we’re pursuing. %$* 129
great— %$* 127
that’s how it would look abroad. %$* 129
let me just add to that and just, very briefly, make it a little sharper perhaps. %$* 127
look, from 1979 on the iranian revolution and the disastrous saudi wahhabi decision to compete with the iranian revolution by exporting wahhabi islam much more aggressively abroad, enabled to do that by the, obviously oil revenues from the ‘70s, that they—once they were able to jack up oil prices in the ‘70s— jihadism, islamic jihadism, islamic extremism, terrorism has been unfortunately on the rise doing some damage to us and huge damage obviously, within the islamic world and in the middle east, and the greater middle east and in south asia. %$* 127
successful bush foreign policy, i mean, successful us foreign policy, which would have been begun by president bush, 10 or 20 years from now, would’ve reversed that and i think we are on the cusp of reversing that. %$* 127
i think that is why the intervention in iraq, the stabilizing of iraq as a non- extremist, non-terror-friendly regime in the center of the middle east, the crushing of al-qaeda, and there’s some very difficult things to be done with pakistan but at least so far maintaining some of the decent civilian government in pakistan, while moving aggressively against the terror, parts of pakistan that had been for quite a long time, terror-friendly, i mean that, reversing that would be incredibly important, that is really crucial to having a decent 21st century. %$* 127
and i think bush has begun to reverse it, there’s much more that has to be done, i trust that president obama will do it. %$* 127
and secondly nuclear weapons. %$* 127
it’s amazing that we have had as little proliferation of nuclear weapons as we’ve had. %$* 127
many experts think over the last 50 years in retrospect the pakistani explosion of nuclear weapons in ’98, and i was no more prescient about this than anyone else, was a huge moment, a very dangerous moment, and what a.q.khan was doing, unbeknownst to us and, you know, to others, was unbelievably dangerous and made possible the north korea program, it’s made possible the iranian program, it accelerated the iranian program. %$* 127
if we can prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, and that means preventing iran from going nuclear, because if iran goes nuclear are other nations in the middle east going nuclear and we’re off to the races, then with a combination of nuclear weapons and possible terrorist and jihadist connections, it’s unbelievably dangerous, so i would say %$* 127
bush i think has done a pretty good job of beginning with that, i might’ve done a few things more hawkish than bush actually, in terms of confronting iran but, you know, he’s got the europeans together for the first time with serious sanctions through the un security council, the united front he’s handing obama, to put as much pressure as possible on iran, if he can turn around the negative momentum on nuclear proliferation and on islamic jihadism, we will have a much safer world, if we can turn it around over the next 20 years, if all of us can turn it around around the world— if not we’re in a lotta trouble. %$* 127
i’m gonna turn one more time and, i wanna hear the question before we go to the panel, i’m really looking for something that talks about the legacy that president-elect obama inherits %$* 13
we’ve had a question from you %$* 13
yes. %$* 13
i for one am proud of the job president bush has done to keep us safe, and, in turn the world. %$* 9
with that said, mr. %$* 9
jenkins and mr. %$* 9
weisberg, you speak in theories, what would you suggest that barack obama now do with islamo-fascism, its threat to the world, and how is that different from the current policies that the bush administration is employing. %$* 9
jacob. %$* 13
i think obama should focus as he’s appropriately doing on afghanistan and how to turn around a deteriorating situation there. %$* 126
i think he should figure out, how to get us out of iraq without iraq falling back into the situation it was in before the surge. %$* 126
i think those are com—things that are compatible, i think they’re possible. %$* 126
and, you know, much of this is so invisible to us that it’s very hard when we say bush has kept us safe. %$* 126
it’s true, we have not had another terrorist attack in the united states. %$* 126
how much of that is the result of policy, how much is the result of accident. %$* 126
we don’t know that much about it, it’s the dog that didn’t bark. %$* 126
would another president have handled it differently, i don’t think so. %$* 126
i think that it’s—it’s impossible to say. %$* 126
simon jenkins. %$* 13
i imagine the reason why there’ve been no more attacks in america or in britain or in most of europe, is because of good policing on the ground, not because you’ve been at war in the middle east. %$* 128
i believe in good policing, i think the kyoto terrorism, whatever that precisely may mean, people blowing people up, is essentially front-line policing. %$* 128
good intelligence, good espionage, good work on the ground. %$* 128
it’s not by going to war against other states. %$* 128
but the phrase islamo-fascism, so easily bandied about from this side of the atlantic, and i may say from europe, when you travel in these countries the relentlessness of the assumption that every arab, every muslim is a crypto-islamo-fascist. %$* 128
and the evidence you give of it, by going in and invading some of their countries, is the surest possible way to turn them into hostile— i cannot emphasize enough— %$* 128
as a follow-up to that— %$* 13
—these are normal people, by and large. %$* 128
they’re people quite like you. %$* 128
they don’t think, most of them, that they have a right to come and invade your country, close down guantanamo bay, do all the things they think you’re doing wrong. %$* 128
there is now an assumption on the part of both your country and my country under tony blair, that we have in some sense a right to go and sort out their countries, because they’re not like our countries. %$* 128
this must be one of the great fallacies of the modern age. %$* 128
i hope obama overcomes it. %$* 128
sir, did—did you get your answer? %$* 13
yes, i did. %$* 9
i didn’t ascribe the term islamo— %$* 9
i’m sorry, i— %$* 13
—fascism to every— %$* 9
can you start—can you begin again, please. %$* 13
i didn’t ascribe the term islamo-fascism to everyone who’s a muslim, or in that part of the world. %$* 9
i’m speaking about a specific group of people, who have no intent but to do all westerners harm. %$* 9
you’ve taken it beyond that which is a great %$* 9
liberal-elitist move to include everybody, but %$* 9
to the answer to my question, how does barack obama, tackle it, what does he do different from the current policies to be effective. %$* 9
well, i think that, good relations with a country, are more likely to get that country to suppress those elements within the country that are inclined to terrorism than bad relations with the country, that has to be true. %$* 128
i myself, i myself tend—i’m sorry, do you— %$* 127
bill kristol. %$* 13
no, i mean i myself tend %$* 127
not to use the word islamo-fascism, i just think it’s a little, analytically confusing, i’m not sure fascism is the best way to describe them but, the islamo-fascists if you wanna use that term, the takfiris, the terror— islamic terrorists have killed more muslims than anyone—than they’ve killed westerners. %$* 127
and if you talk to muslims they want those people, to many muslims including many in iraq, the greatest single vic— what country has been the greatest victim of the terrorists of al- qaeda? %$* 127
iraqis, iraqi muslims. %$* 127
and they are grateful now that they are going to be able to vote in 2009 in regional elections and in national elections and have a shot at not having a horrible dictator who himself murdered hundreds of thousands of people, who are not being dominated by ghastly islamo-fascists if you wanna use the word, but i do think, i sort of agree with the question in that sense— precisely using the term islamo-fascist separates, the reason you use the term is precisely to say that’s not all of islam, that’s a little part of it which unfortunately has been ascendant, and if not resisted, will become more ascendant, and we need to help people resist it, we can’t stand back and say hey, none of our business, afghanistan, taliban takes over, so tough on you, you know, and saddam, tough on you guys, and i guess in the sudan, it’s tough, and other places it’s tough and the iranian civil society gets suppressed, and i guess we just can’t say anything. %$* 127
and we just say hey, that’s the way they wanna live in that part of the world, i mean that is really what the counsel i think of these sort of realists who want us to think they are going to improve america’s standing in the world and in fact, will correctly call down condemnation on america as has happened in the past. %$* 127
incidentally, one of the things that encouraged radicalism in the middle east, was the sense that we were standing aside, and supporting dictators out of narrow self- interest. %$* 127
the single greatest harm we did to ourselves was stepping back in ’91, we went in to kick saddam out of kuwait which was correct, we needed to do so for strategic reasons, and then we abandoned the people of iraq, when saddam turned on them, i don’t think that’s something to be proud of and i very much hope actually that barack obama does not revert to that kind of foreign policy. %$* 127
i’d like to quickly— i’d like to quickly return to a question about why was america kept safe for seven years. %$* 129
we’re given two answers, one was luck and the other was that any other president would’ve handled it the same way. %$* 129
now luck does come into play. %$* 129
but luck works when you have the kinda attitude that this president has which is he’s gonna stay on the offense so we fight ‘em over there, and we’re gonna use every intelligence tool at our disposal, to find out what they’re up to. %$* 129
that is why we broke some of the plots that you know about publicly. %$* 129
you don’t know about all the plots but you know about the attempt to bring down liberty tower in los angeles, or to blow up airliners simultaneously over the pacific ocean. %$* 129
we’re able to break up those plots because this president adopted programs—now maybe, jacob is right that any other president would’ve pursued the terrorist surveillance program, and the widespread use of our intelligence assets abroad, to listen in on the enemy. %$* 129
i hope he’s right. %$* 129
what do you mean, karl, by fight them over there, they weren’t in iraq. %$* 126
unless you meant somewhere else by over there. %$* 126
well first of all, again i repeat, i appreciate you support for the war in iraq at the time. %$* 129
well, i wasn’t— %$* 126
but jacob, but let’s be honest, he was supporting terrorists, this is a man who, who gave payments to terror bombers. %$* 129
this is a guy who allowed terrorist camps to organize in his country. %$* 129
the ricin attack in london was launched from a camp in northeast iraq, this is not a nation which you can organize a terrorist camp without the central authorities knowing about it— %$* 129
hang on— %$* 126
—in the aftermath—pardon me, let me finish. %$* 129
okay. %$* 126
in the aftermath of afghanistan and taking down the taliban, where did zarqawi go for medical treatment. %$* 129
he checked himself into the mayo clinic of baghdad. %$* 129
you don’t get that unless somebody in the government up top allows a known terrorist to seek, to seek succor and medical care in baghdad, this was a bad actor. %$* 129
now, did we think he had weapons of mass destruction, you bet, and i’ve got a sheaf-load of quotes from people that you love, like ted kennedy and others saying he did. %$* 129
he didn’t. %$* 129
we now know that. %$* 129
we went in on intelligence that was flawed, but i would remind you of this. %$* 129
intelligence gets it wrong both ways. %$* 129
in the run-up to iraq muammar qaddafi looked around and said you know the united states is serious about it, britain is serious about this, i got problems. %$* 129
if they’re willing to take out 25 million people and take on iraq with 25 million people they’re willing to take me on. %$* 129
and he coughed up his weapons programs. %$* 129
and western intelligence found out they were wrong, they systematically underestimated how far along his chemical and biological programs were which were weaponized, and how far along his nuclear program which—which was way beyond what anybody in western intelligence thought he had. %$* 129
what was this ricin attack in britain. %$* 128
jacob, simon, the rest of the panel, i wanna— if you wanna respond to karl’s point, save it for your summary two minutes— %$* 13
milk powder, milk powder. %$* 128
simon— thanks. %$* 13
we’re out of time on the questions and answers but you have two minutes to sum up, and you can respond to the point there, i just wanna thank all of you, and encourage you to give yourselves a round of applause for terrific questions. %$* 13
so, i wanna remind you where we are in this intelligence squared us debate. %$* 13
we’ve already polled you when you came in before the debate began to see where you agree on the motion. %$* 13
the motion before us is, “george w.bush is the worst president of the last 50 years.” “bush 43 is the worst president of the last 50 years,” before the debate, 65 percent of you agreed with the motion, 17 percent were against, 18 percent, one in five of you roughly, were undecided, and we’re going to poll you again shortly but now we move on to the final session of the debate in which each of the panelists has two minutes to summarize. %$* 13
i will step in at the two-minute mark just to tell you that your time is up, and we are going to begin the summary against the motion, that george w. bush is the worst president of the last 50 years, bill kristol, the editor of the weekly standard. %$* 13
as someone who grew up not far from here it’s embarrassing frankly that 83 percent of the people who voted think either that bush is the worst president in 50 years or are undecided about it. %$* 127
look, people don’t have to like bush, half the country voted against him in 2000 and—well, virtually almost half in 2004, if you’re a liberal you won’t approve of his domestic policies, if you think that we’d be better off not having gone into iraq which obviously is a debatable proposition, you could be very condemnatory of going into iraq and certainly many people have criticized the way in which we managed that war from 2004 to 2006.there’s no reason not to be critical of bush, not to disagree with bush, not to prefer obama, not to have voted for gore and kerry, most people in new york obviously, have all those views. %$* 127
but to think that he’s the worst president in 50 years is just silly. %$* 127
it’s just silly and it came out very well in the vietnam discussion, i mean are we being serious here? %$* 127
vietnam was well-run and that was okay somehow and, you know, westmoreland knew what he was doing. %$* 127
of course we lost 55,000 people, we lost a war, 2 million people plus died in vietnam and cambodia, it was an unbelievable catastrophe, which the region took a long time to recover from, it was a terrible humiliation moral and political for the united states. %$* 127
that’s like iraq? %$* 127
where we’ve lost 4,000 soldiers, where iraq is now back on its feet, where we’ve won the war, where we’ve won the war and established us credibility and a willingness to stick to it even though we’ve made terrible mistakes and where we’re actually in pretty good shape with most of the governments in the region, i myself being more of a democracy and human rights activist am a little unhappy that we’re so friendly— %$* 127
bill, conclude— %$* 13
—with the governments— %$* 127
—your time is up, 15 seconds grace. %$* 13
with the governments in the region. %$* 127
but we are so if we’re in the real world, in the real world you can dislike george w. bush but you should be against this motion. %$* 127
summing up for the motion that george w.bush is the worst american president in the last 50 years, jacob weisberg, author of the bush tragedy and editor-in-chief of the slate group. %$* 13
jacob weisberg. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 126
“we’ve won the war in iraq,” there’s something about this “mission accomplished” language that always makes me a little nervous. %$* 126
i think the damage in iraq can be mitigated, but it can’t— the war can’t be vindicated as a decision. %$* 126
and this goes to the heart of our disagreement, bill said at the beginning that bush had bad choices, i don’t think he had bad choices, i think he made bad choices. %$* 126
and i think things could’ve been different for bush. %$* 126
i think he could’ve taken a different approach, and in fact it was the approach he took when he was governor of texas. %$* 126
he could’ve united the country and the world after september 11th, it would’ve given him an opportunity to be a great president, he could’ve reached out to the other party the way fdr did after pearl harbor. %$* 126
he could’ve kept his focus on america’s real enemies, as opposed to becoming distracted by saddam hussein. %$* 126
he could’ve compromised with democrats on a whole range of issues including climate change, expanding health care coverage, entitlement reform. %$* 126
he could’ve focused on protecting the free market instead of the interests of big business. %$* 126
and i think if bush had tried to govern from the center right, instead of from the far right, he would’ve been reelected by a bigger margin in 2004 and he would’ve been a successful president. %$* 126
but bush was never up to the job of being president, and it’s not a matter of lacking in intelligence, it’s a matter of lacking character. %$* 126
bush wasn’t interested enough in policy, he couldn’t tolerate challenge or dissent or disagreement, he couldn’t open his mind long enough to consider alternatives or admit the possibility that he might sometimes be wrong. %$* 126
he let his righteousness and his arrogance and his anger get the better of him. %$* 126
and in the end i think what’s so damning about bush and what does make him the worst president of the last 50 years, is that these were things within his control. %$* 126
and to finish, i think we can say at this point that, american’s great nepotistic experiment is finally coming to an end. %$* 126
it’s— and as my colleague simon jenkins has said, it’s finishing not just with failure, not just with rejection, but in global disgrace. %$* 126
thank you, jacob weisberg. %$* 13
making his summary statement against the motion that george w. bush is the worst american president of the last 50 years, karl rove, former deputy chief of staff and senior advisor to george w. bush. %$* 13
john, you said that with a particular glee, i mean it’s, %$* 129
look %$* 129
i wanna end with, by accentuating the point that bill made, but first of all i need to say jacob’s comments can be read in his book, which is a piece of fiction. %$* 129
to believe that george w.bush didn’t tolerate strong people in his cabinet or dissent, or disagreements, is ridiculous. %$* 129
and to suggest that he’s not interested in ideas is that peculiar form of bush hatred that causes people to lose their rational senses about the man. %$* 129
and this president has been— this president has been on the receiving end of this kinda attitude since the moment that he took office in an election, that many on the left thought made him an illegitimate president. %$* 129
now, here’s a man who one of his—the first person that he met with from the united states congress was the democrat, ranking democrat on the house education and labor committee, george miller. %$* 129
didn’t compromise with democrats, didn’t compromise with democrats on no child left behind which he worked with ted kennedy and george miller and john boehner and judd gregg to get passed. %$* 129
didn’t cooperate and compromise with democrats when we came out and endorsed wholesale large elements of the joe lieberman program for homeland security. %$* 129
didn’t compromise with democrats when we came out for immigration reform? %$* 129
you know, that’s just ridiculous. %$* 129
but i wanna end, ‘cause most of the circle’s around iraq. %$* 129
vietnam i agree, better prosecuted than iraq? %$* 129
we ended vietnam in defeat, for which the families of 55,000 fallen heroes, had reason to ask themselves, whether or not that sacrifice had been made in vain. %$* 129
and we’re coming out of iraq with iraq becoming a functioning democracy in the heart of the middle east, still fragile, but because of the surge, and a place today where we can see the moment that us troops can come home with their honor and in victory. %$* 129
and for which the sacrifices of those who have died, will not have been in vain. %$* 129
karl rove, time up, take fifteen seconds, if you need it. %$* 13
you're good? %$* 13
karl rove. %$* 13
summing up, finally, for the motion that “george w.bush is the worst president of the last fifty years,” simon jenkins, journalist and columnist for the guardian. %$* 13
simon jenkins. %$* 13
well, i repeat my view at the very beginning. %$* 128
i'm not here to be rude about an american president. %$* 128
i would just point out about iraq, you cannot say something’s a success when i saw last week two million iraqi’s are camped outside damascus because they haven't got the nerve to go home to their homeland because the americans are there. %$* 128
two thirds of all the christians in iraq have been driven out of that country under america’s aegis. %$* 128
fundamentalism is far more rife in southern iraq than it ever was under saddam hussein. %$* 128
let’s just get some facts here. %$* 128
however, let me come back to the original point, i had great respect for bush when he came to power. %$* 128
i liked his courtesy, i liked his moderation, and i liked his concept of humility in america’s power projection. %$* 128
i think, tragically, after 9/11 he allowed the politics of fear to get the better of him, he persuaded my prime minister, tony blair, to let the politics of fear aid his re-election campaign as well. %$* 128
the politics of fear is the most corrosive of all forms of politics in a democracy. %$* 128
power, and america remains %$* 128
remains a hugely powerful country, power has an obligation of restraint. %$* 128
if you're the most powerful country in the world, your obligation is not to go over the top, to charge around the world invading countries on the feeblest of pretexts, your obligation is to show restraint. %$* 128
my america was always a country of huge self confidence, belief in its ability to resist attack of any sort, and not needing to erode its own freedoms and those of other people in order to achieve that defense of democracy. %$* 128
i personally think that you’ve just elected a man who i have found, from when i first read his book, a truly remarkable figure, on whom i think it is right to place great expectations. %$* 128
and, but, he has got to recover from a terrible legacy in the world, outside america. %$* 128
i still believe he will. %$* 128
i think you have a terrific future ahead of you, but you have been through an awful eight years. %$* 128
thank you very much. %$* 128
thank you, simon jenkins. %$* 13
and may i invite a round of applause for our entire panel. %$* 13
i'm asking them to sit back down for the moment of truth. %$* 13
gentleman, have your seats once more, because we have to decide the winner. %$* 13
let’s remember where we are. %$* 13
we have heard the debates, we have heard the arguments, and we have heard from you when you came into this debate, that sixty-five percent of you were for the motion, that “george w.bush is the worst american president of the last fifty years,” “bush 43 is the worst president of the last fifty years.” it is now time for you, seventeen percent of you were against, and eighteen percent, one in five, were undecided. %$* 13
it is now time for you to reach for those keypads and register your decision at this point. %$* 13
while you're doing that, i will %$* 13
does anybody need more time? %$* 13
is everybody locked in? %$* 13
ok. sorry? %$* 13
oh, i'm sorry, some of you weren't here in the beginning, which really is going to mess up the numbers, isn't it? %$* 13
you press one if you are for the motion, two if you are against the motion, and three if you remain undecided. %$* 13
the other keys don’t matter. %$* 13
if you make a mistake, just re-enter your number, and your last number will be recorded by the computer. %$* 13
everyone is clear on that? %$* 13
and does anyone need more time? %$* 13
just shout out. %$* 13
ok, so the numbers are being tabulated, it will take about ninety seconds. %$* 13
and while we’re waiting for the vote i would like to remind you that our next debate will be here again at the symphony space, and it will be recorded once again for broadcast on bbc world news television. %$* 13
the motion to be debated on tuesday, january 13th, 2009, is this: “major reductions in carbon emissions are not worth the money.” panelists for the motion are peter huber, bjorn lomborg, and philip stott. %$* 13
against the motion, daniel kammen, oliver tickell, and adam werbach. %$* 13
and we will see you all back here in january at symphony space. %$* 13
and just in time, thank you, the results come. %$* 13
well, we tend to judge who is the winner by who moved most positions, and in that case, i’ll give you the numbers in a second, but the bottom line is that those against the motion changed more minds tonight than those for the motion. %$* 13
before the debate sixty-five percent were for the motion, seventeen percent against, and eighteen percent undecided. %$* 13
after the debate, sixty-eight percent were for the motion, twenty-seven percent are against the motion, and five percent remain undecided. %$* 13
congratulations to all of our panelists, congratulations to you, and thank you for joining us at this intelligence squared us debate. %$* 13

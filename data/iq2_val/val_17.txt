and-- %$* 13
and as i said, we are delighted to be doing this debate in partnership with the mccain institute for international leadership. %$* 13
and i would like to welcome to this lectern the institute's executive director, ambassador kurt volker. %$* 13
thank you, john. %$* 117
thank you very much. %$* 117
delighted to be here and delighted to be partnering with intelligence squared again. %$* 117
we've done another debate together on defense budgets. %$* 117
the mccain institute for international leadership is a part of arizona state university, based in washington, d.c.with a strong footprint in arizona as well. %$* 117
and in fact, during the course of tonight's debate, we have students who will be watching this at asu.and it will be broadcast on arizona state television as well. %$* 117
we seek, at the mccain institute, to advance the next generation of character-driven leadership. %$* 117
that is our core mission. %$* 117
and part of that core mission is to advance the culture and the practice of serious debate over serious issues affecting our country. %$* 117
we've launched this debate series at the mccain institute back in january with debates on syria policy and afghanistan. %$* 117
we're delighted to be doing this one with intelligence squared. %$* 117
we have another one on december 5th. %$* 117
please come, this room, december 5th, on drone policy: are we going too far? %$* 117
i'm confused now about the hash tags because if you want to tweet, and you can do it without interfering with the signals, then it's hash tag spy debate. %$* 117
but if it interferes, don't do that. %$* 117
john, what was the signal you showed for spontaneous applause? %$* 117
thank you. %$* 117
yeah, what we're really counting on is limited tweeting competence in the audience. %$* 13
so-- %$* 13
so if you can, we're delighted, but if you're not, we just want you to shut down. %$* 13
and just to get us started, i just want to, one more time, give a round of applause to ambassador volker for bringing us here. %$* 13
metaphor: the u.s.government sucking in all of that data about the phone calls that we make when we're talking, who we're talking to, how long we're talking, is a fishing trawler dragging a net across the high seas. %$* 13
the government and its crew at the national security agency wants to catch bad guys, terrorists the crew on the fishing boat wants to catch, let's make it tune a fish. %$* 13
but the fishermen's net also drags along with it all those good guys who are swimming out there, those cute little dolphins. %$* 13
and the dolphins die, which is a clear harm to them. %$* 13
but is there a harm to us in the data that is collected by the nsa in its net. %$* 13
nobody likes it, but nobody dies from it. %$* 13
in fact, the argument is that the nsa's big net is saving lives, keeping all of us little dolphins out there safe. %$* 13
yes? %$* 13
no? %$* 13
well, it sounds like there's a debate in that, so let's have. %$* 13
yes or no to this statement: spy on me, i would rather be safe. %$* 13
a debate from intelligence squared u.s., in partnership with the mccain institute for international leadership. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four superbly qualified debaters, americans all. %$* 13
but two against two in this debate for and against this motion: spy on me, i would rather be safe. %$* 13
we look at this motion not as an extreme statement, all for spying and all against spying. %$* 13
but we're going to be talking about gradations, what's in the middle. %$* 13
as always, our debate goes in three rounds, and then the audience votes to choose the winner and only one side wins. %$* 13
our motion is, "spy on me, i'd rather be safe.” let's meet the team arguing for this motion. %$* 13
first of all, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome stewart baker. %$* 13
and stewart, you were the nsa's top lawyer, and later on, you became the first assistant secretary for policy at the department of homeland security. %$* 13
and in your memoir, "skating on stilts," you wrote about having to build the whole thing from scratch, recruiting the right people, setting up a budget. %$* 13
and at the end of it, you wrote this: "i did that. %$* 13
now i'm tired." so have you caught up on your sleep? %$* 13
well, i may never be tan, but i'm rested, and i'm ready. %$* 118
all right. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, stewart baker. %$* 13
and, stewart, your partner is? %$* 13
oh, rich falkenrath-- %$* 118
with whom i worked at the department of homeland security, and one of the people i admired most in my government service. %$* 118
ladies and gentlemen, richard falkenrath. %$* 13
richard, you are also arguing for this motion: spy on me, i'd rather be safe. %$* 13
you've held a lot of leadership positions in u.s.counterterrorism efforts. %$* 13
you were deputy homeland security advisor under the bush administration. %$* 13
you were new york city's police department's deputy commissioner for counterterrorism. %$* 13
both jobs, tough places, tough times. %$* 13
but which is the harder place to live in, new york or washington? %$* 13
washington's harder. %$* 119
i'll take traffic gridlock over partisan gridlock any day. %$* 119
ooh, clever, clever. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, richard falkenrath. %$* 13
our motion is this: spy on me, i'd rather be safe. %$* 13
we have two debaters now arguing against this motion. %$* 13
first, let's welcome, please, david cole. %$* 13
david, you are a professor of law at north town university law center. %$* 13
you are one of the country's leading civil liberties advocates. %$* 13
you've litigated many constitutional cases, big ones, in front of the supreme court. %$* 13
we read that when you off to law school, you did not actually plan on being a lawyer, but you were going to be a writer. %$* 13
so you didn't, so i'm wondering, is the nation missing one great american novel? %$* 13
well, i think it turns out the truth is stranger than fiction. %$* 120
if i'd written a novel saying the nsa was spying on every one of us, no one would have believed it. %$* 120
thank you. %$* 13
thank you, david cole. %$* 13
these guys are on fire already. %$* 13
and your partner is? %$* 13
mike german, one of the few people in the world who's worked for both the fbi and the aclu. %$* 120
exactly. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, michael german. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13
you worked for the fbi for 16 years. %$* 13
you were a special agent in domestic terrorism for 12 of those years. %$* 13
then you moved on, and you resigned in 2004. and now you work for policy-- %$* 13
on policy for the ucla-- %$* 13
the ucla. now you're working for-- %$* 13
on policy for the aclu. and i'm just wondering, does-- %$* 13
how does being-- %$* 13
having all that undercover experience come into play for you now? %$* 13
well, the first rule of working undercover is never telling anyone you've ever worked undercover. %$* 121
oh. %$* 13
boy, did i make a mistake. %$* 13
well, ladies and gentlemen, michael german. %$* 13
so those our-- %$* 13
those are our debaters. %$* 13
and our motion is "spy on me, i would rather be safe.” and this is say debate. %$* 13
it's a contest. %$* 13
these two teams are competing for your votes. %$* 13
and by the time this debate has ended, we will have asked you to vote twice, how you stand on this motion. %$* 13
and at the end of the debate, the team whose numbers have been changed the most in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so let's go to the preliminary vote. %$* 13
go to the key pads at your seat. %$* 13
and you look at the motion and the team arguing for it, this side-- %$* 13
the motion is "spy on me, i'd rather be safe. %$* 13
if you agree with that motion, push number one. %$* 13
if you're on the other side at this point, if you're against this motion, push number two. %$* 13
and if you're undecided, a perfectly reasonable position, push number three. %$* 13
you can ignore the other keys. %$* 13
they're not live. %$* 13
and if you push the wrong button, just correct yourself, and the system will lock in your correct vote-- %$* 13
your last vote. %$* 13
and then at the end of the debate, we're going to go through the process again, and we get a readout in about 45 seconds to a minute and a half. %$* 13
so you'll know-- %$* 13
we'll know who the winner is based on whose numbers have changed the most in percentage point terms. %$* 13
so we go in three rounds. %$* 13
and now we go onto round one, opening statements from each of our debaters in turn. %$* 13
they will be six minutes each. %$* 13
speaking first for this motion, "spy on me, i'd rather be safe," richard falkenrath. %$* 13
he is a principal at the chertoff group and former new york city police department deputy commissioner for counterterrorism. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, richard falkenrath. %$* 13
thank you very much, john. %$* 119
thank you all for coming. %$* 119
these issues we're debating tonight are difficult and very complex. %$* 119
they engage some of the most fundamental issues in american public life: liberty, security, technology, democracy. %$* 119
and there really are no simple answers to this. %$* 119
we'll do our best to distill it, but let me just say, anyone who's worked in these issues in a practical way knows how hard they are and that they do need to be very carefully weighed and not handled impulsively or ideologically. %$* 119
i'm going to make three points in this opening statement. %$* 119
the programs that we're going to talk about tonight really do matter for security. %$* 119
and for me, having been deputy commissioner of counterterrorism at the nypd and then three different jobs in the white house before, during and after 9/11, i can really tell you this on a first hand basis. %$* 119
and we may get into some of the details of how this works, how these sorts of systems lead to the original lead that then leads to the unraveling of a plot and the saving of lives. %$* 119
it is not abstract. %$* 119
it is real no kidding lives at stake sort of business. %$* 119
i don't want to hyperventilate about it, but i've lived through enough of them to be able to recount some of the direct experiences. %$* 119
and if that comes up in a q&a, we'll have to go through them in greater detail. %$* 119
but they really do matter. %$* 119
turns out a terrorist plot is not that difficult to stop if you know about it, and finding out about it in the first place is by far the hardest step in the process. %$* 119
in the overwhelming number of incidents that we've had since 9/11, that original lead, what's called the "predication for further investigative steps," has come from electronic surveillance of one form or another, so these programs really do matter. %$* 119
second, and what i'm about to say i think is going to unite both sides of this debate. %$* 119
stewart and i have worked on these issues for a while. %$* 119
we are for lawful surveillance, lawful forms of electronic surveillance, things which clearly backed up by the constitution, by statute, and by court interpretation are permissible, so don't for a second think that stewart and i are arguing for anything that is illegal. %$* 119
and since the other side i think is very likely not to argue in favor of illegal surveillance either, i think this is something that brings us together. %$* 119
we are for lawful forms of surveillance. %$* 119
and there is an extensive body of law that governs when, how, where these systems can be deployed. %$* 119
and this is not a legal seminar, but i can tell you that, that system has evolved in such a way, over the last 35 years, that it is really nothing short of an enormous success for the american privacy and civil liberties community. %$* 119
it's hard to believe, but it's a fact that 35 years ago there was no statutory constraint and no jurisprudential constraint on the ability of the president of the united states to conduct electronic surveillance inside the united states for foreign intelligence purposes. %$* 119
it was unfettered. %$* 119
now it's fettered quite significantly, first with the creation of a fisa court, the foreign intelligence surveillance court, with-- %$* 119
and an act of 1978, and then adjusted in important ways with the fisa modernization acts of the last five years. %$* 119
and so this is something you really have to understand, if you take this in kind of broader historical context, an incredible amount of progress has been made, and these sorts of programs have been brought under the constraint of law where they were not previously. %$* 119
previously-- %$* 119
if these laws had never been passed, it was solely the powers of the president under the constitution, article 2 that permitted him to do this. %$* 119
and those days are over. %$* 119
now there is a law which governs it, and many laws, in fact, and the court is involved in overseeing things which previously were exclusively within the domain of the president. %$* 119
there are now checks and balances on his power to do that, and that is extraordinary progress. %$* 119
and the third thing i want to say is how unusual this area is in washington. %$* 119
as i said, there's partisan gridlock in here. %$* 119
name me another issue in public life, health care or taxation or entitlement reform or what to do in the middle east, where you have the executive branch, the legislative branch, and the judiciary all unanimous about the contours and direction of a specific program. %$* 119
it's remarkable that this happened, not just the three branches of government but in the case of the executive branch a set of policies and programs which have survived partisan transition. %$* 119
so these programs which we have today emerged in the latter half of the bush administration and have survived essentially unchanged into the obama administration, two leaders who could not be more different. %$* 119
and they are unchanged. %$* 119
and so this is where the other side of this debate really have a pretty tough argument because you have broad bipartisan majorities in both chambers of congress, the two presidents of different parties, different characters, one, the current one, quite liberal and quite educated in constitutional law-- %$* 119
he taught it, university of chicago-- %$* 119
and the judiciary all backing up and saying it's fine. %$* 119
so what the other side has to do, and it's a tough burden i think, is say, "they've all got it wrong, we've got it right, we know better.” and i think frankly that's a pretty high burden for them. %$* 119
thank you very much. %$* 119
thank you, richard falkenrath. %$* 13
i just want to mention to our other debaters, we give them a visual clock so they know how much time they have left. %$* 13
and our clock's not functioning. %$* 13
richard, you hit it. %$* 13
you have a magic clock in your head. %$* 13
but if the other debaters would like me to give them a 30-second warning to give you a target, i'm happy to do that. %$* 13
and if you don’t think, you know, so i’ll just-- %$* 13
i’ll just gently say 30 seconds. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
i’ll do that. %$* 13
our motion is this: spy on me, i would rather be safe, and our next debater will be speaking against the motion. %$* 13
he is michael german, senior policy counselor for the american civil liberty union, washington legislative office, and a former fbi special agent. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, michael german. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 121
thank you, john, and just to be clear, the question isn’t whether there are threats; there have always been threats and i would be the last person in the world to tell you that there aren’t threats right here in our own community that can harm us. %$* 121
and it’s not whether the government should have tools to address those threats-- %$* 121
of course it should. %$* 121
it’s whether the tools the government is using today are necessary, legal, or effective. %$* 121
i oppose the motion spy on me, i’d rather be safe because i’m not a terrorist or a violent criminal, and spying on me isn’t going to keep anybody safe. %$* 121
and unless you’re a terrorist or a criminal you should also vote no, whether you care about your privacy or not because spying on you is only going to waste security resources and fill important intelligence databases with irrelevant information. %$* 121
spying on you and spying on me makes us less free and less safe. %$* 121
we know that spying on us didn’t protect us from the christmas day underwear bomber, from the times square bomber, from najibullah zazi’s crew who got an explosive into new york city, but ultimately flushed it down the toilet rather than detonating it. %$* 121
these terrorists all traveled to foreign terrorist training camps. %$* 121
then they came to the united states and attempted to bomb us. %$* 121
luck is what protected us in these cases, not mass surveillance. %$* 121
spying also didn’t protect us from the boston marathon bombers or shootings at fort hood or at an army recruiting center in arkansas. %$* 121
these terrorists were investigated by the fbi before they went on their rampages and yet they weren’t stopped. %$* 121
while the government was spying on us, violence from far right extremists killed 300 people in the united states since 2001.and this is just a tiny fraction of the 14,000 murders that happen in the united states every year. %$* 121
a third of those-- %$* 121
more than a third of those-- %$* 121
go unsolved. %$* 121
solving 4,000 murders a year? %$* 121
that would keep us safer. %$* 121
in a 16-year fbi career, i can honestly say i never found a criminal or a terrorist by rummaging through the personal information of innocent people. %$* 121
traditional law enforcement standards of reasonable suspicion and probable cause don’t just exist to protect our rights. %$* 121
these standards actually helped me as an investigator, because they forced me to focus on the right people for the right reasons, to follow evidence rather than flawed hunches or profiles. %$* 121
in my undercover work against neo-nazis and anti-government militias, there were a lot of people saying things i didn’t like, but i knew i had to have a reasonable basis to assume somebody was engaging in violent activity or illegal activity. %$* 121
otherwise, if i couldn’t find that i could just turn my attention to somebody else, because again there are real threats, and this standard helped me focus my investigations properly so those cases successfully prevented terrorist attacks, ended in successful prosecution, and didn’t violate anyone’s rights. %$* 121
today our government’s spying on all of us in a lot of different ways. %$* 121
it collects all of our telephone records on an ongoing daily basis. %$* 121
it photocopies every piece of domestic mail, it intercepts americans’ international communications and financial transactions, it collects millions of images from license plates readers and surveillance cameras. %$* 121
the fbi even collects census information so it can map american communities by race and ethnicity. %$* 121
the problem with these programs-- %$* 121
the problem is that these programs collect so much information that the signal gets lost in the noise. %$* 121
so it’s not a surprise that the nsa can point to only one terrorism-related prosecution that might not have happened absent gobbling up all of our telephone numbers, and that was a material support for terrorism case that involved an $8,000 transmittal to somalia. %$* 121
think of the billions of dollars these programs cost and how that could have been spent on so many different things, including things that improve security. %$* 121
if a 2011 triple homicide in waltham, massachusetts had been solved the boston marathon bombing might never have happened. %$* 121
instead of making us safe, these mass surveillance programs cast undeserved suspicion on innocent people, simply because they’re linked somehow to a suspect-- %$* 121
not a terrorist, but suspect, often by two or three degrees of separation, like that old kevin bacon game. %$* 121
this process creates a flood of false positives that then have to be run to ground. %$* 121
these are what the fbi used to call the "pizza hut leads" because they often ended up at the pizza delivery guy. %$* 121
the difficulty resolving this false suspicion leads to bloated watch lists, the watch list, over a million names on it now, but often not the right names, like the underwear bombers. %$* 121
the flood of data coming into the intelligence community is so overwhelming the agents that it's harming our security. %$* 121
the national counterterrorism center says it receives 5,000 pieces of information and puts 350 people on the watch list every day. %$* 121
the official review of the fbi's investigation of major nadal hassan prior to the fort hood shooting blamed what is called "the relentless workload on the agent," which was caused by-- %$* 121
what it said was a data explosion within the fbi.the fbi assessment of boston marathon bomber tamerlan tsarnaev was one of 1,000 assessments the boston jttf did that year. %$* 121
a study of intelligence community analysts published earlier this year included some interesting quotes. %$* 121
one analyst said, "there's just so much information. %$* 121
how do i know which of 3,000 cables to pay attention to? %$* 121
it's an unrealistic expectation." %$* 121
30 seconds. %$* 13

michael german, i'm sorry, your time is up. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
michael german. %$* 13
and here's where we are. %$* 13
we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two against two arguing it out over this motion: spy on me, i'd rather be safe. %$* 13
you have heard from the first two debaters, and now onto the third. %$* 13
and stewart, our clocks are working again. %$* 13
is that going to be enough for you? %$* 13
that'll be fine. %$* 118
you don't want the audible. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
here's-- %$* 13
i'm going to introduce you. %$* 13
here to debate for the motion, "spy on me, i'd rather be safe," stewart baker. %$* 13
he is former general counsel of the nsa and the first assistant secretary for policy for the department of homeland security, currently a professor-- %$* 13
currently a partner at the law firm, steptoe and johnston. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, stewart baker. %$* 13
thanks, john. %$* 118
mike german has put the problem, i think, as directly as it could be. %$* 118
when, if ever, is it appropriate for the government to gather data on large populations, everybody in order to make us more safe? %$* 118
so that's the question. %$* 118
you can call it spying on everybody, if you like, and he does. %$* 118
but it's not as unusual or as ineffective, and certainly not illegal as he suggests. %$* 118
and i'll take his challenge of saying, "when has spying on everybody-- %$* 118
when has gathering all of the data on everybody, innocent or not, helped us stop terrorist attacks? %$* 118
" and let's take the zazi case, the times square bombing case, the underwear bomber. %$* 118
when i was at dhs, one of the things we fought very hard to do was something that i think mike german would call spying on everyone. %$* 118
we said we want the airlines to give us the travel reservation information and the passport information on everybody who's flying into the united states; everybody, not just the suspects. %$* 118
we need to know who's coming here. %$* 118
we use that data to compare the names and the information that was on there to the databases in which we had information about people we were worried about, or patterns that we were worried about. %$* 118
and then when those people arrived, a few of them, half of a percent, would end up spending about 45 minutes talking to a customs agent about why they were coming to the united states, who would try to determine whether this person was a threat. %$* 118
that was a routine practice. %$* 118
and most of us just, you know, it's welcome home, and you move on. %$* 118
but a few people, they couldn't stop everybody, but they could stop a few people. %$* 118
they used this data to decide who was worth worrying about. %$* 118
now, let's take the underwear bomber. %$* 118
the people who did airport security had no information about him. %$* 118
and not surprisingly, didn't check in very carefully, and he got right past them. %$* 118
it turned out that when he was due to land, he had already been flagged by the customs folks who had access to that data as somebody that they, through checking back in databases, were able to identify as somebody that they were worried about. %$* 118
so he would have been caught if we'd had the information earlier, and he would have been caught when he landed. %$* 118
that's, indeed, probably why al-qaeda wanted to blow up the plane before he had to get past the customs officials. %$* 118
the same thing is true for the times square bomber, where after the bombing, the fbi got a phone number. %$* 118
they asked our guys, do you have that phone number? %$* 118
did anybody with that phone number come into the united states? %$* 118
turned out that he'd given that same phone number to the airline for his reservation data. %$* 118
the department was able to identify him, provide the data, start a man hunt. %$* 118
and then he got on the plane and was about to leave the country. %$* 118
the only reason we caught him is because we had data on everybody who was getting on that plane, and we were able to run the information in the background and determine, this is the guy we're looking for. %$* 118
he's on the plane. %$* 118
that plane had already closed its doors when the customs officials went on to pull him off. %$* 118
he would have gotten away, but for the data which mike german calls, "spying on everybody.” i would call it "gathering data that is already in the hands of third parties," given it to the airlines, they're going to use it to decide whether you get chicken or tornadoes, and whether you get that 3 inches of extra leg room. %$* 118
you know, i'm happy to have that information also used to make sure i actually arrive at my destination. %$* 118
and it seems to me that the intrusion-- %$* 118
you can call a lot of scary things, but the fact is, at the end of the day, it's information that i willingly shared with the airlines, and i'm happy that they're using it to protect me as well. %$* 118
that's the real question we have here, is, can we use data that we've given to a third party, can the government use data that you've given to a third party, to try to find terrorists? %$* 118
we do that all the time. %$* 118
the nsa program is probably the most aggressive use of that. %$* 118
but at the end of the day, this is billing information you've given-- %$* 118
we've all given to the phone companies. %$* 118
it is searched by law enforcement outside of the nsa program 1.3 million times a year. %$* 118
what the nsa did, at the end of the day, through the program and through the safeguards that they established for that program, they required-- %$* 118
yes, we gather the information, but no one can search it without articulable, reasonable suspicion passed on by a lawyer. %$* 118
it'll be audited. %$* 118
a limited number of people will have access to it. %$* 118
at the end of the day, 300 numbers went into that on a given year. %$* 118
500-- %$* 118
there were searches to find who they were talking to. %$* 118
500 numbers came out as potentially suspicious. %$* 118
and only then did the government go out to try to find out whose name was associated with those phone numbers. %$* 118
500 people versus-- %$* 118
and all used for terrorist purposes, all carefully scrubbed versus 1.3 million searches done by law enforcement every day without bringing 1984 home to america. %$* 118
thank you. %$* 118
thank you, stewart baker. %$* 13
our motion is, "spy on me, i would rather be safe.” and now our final debater making an open statement is david cole. %$* 13
he will be arguing against this motion. %$* 13
he's a professor at georgetown university law center, and a volunteer attorney for the center for constitutional rights. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, david cole. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 120
stewart baker gave a great defense of the public passenger data program that we've all known about for years, and no one has had any problem with. %$* 120
of course, that's not what's at issue here. %$* 120
what's at issue here is whether we have a problem with the secret nsa program adopted in secret through secret interpretations of a law whose author said this would never-- %$* 120
he never would have dreamed of authorizing this sort of program, had he known that's what the government was going to do with it. %$* 120
i think that's a very different question. %$* 120
the nsa is collecting information on every time every one of us calls or texts anybody; your son, your daughter, your mother, your doctor, your psychiatrist, your aa mentor, your old girlfriend, your new girlfriend. %$* 120
that's what they're collecting. %$* 120
it's not passenger data about people getting on airplanes. %$* 120
it's literally every phone call. %$* 120
it's doing it in secret, as i said, pursuant to a secret interpretation of a law whose author said this is not consistent with what i understood. %$* 120
and rich falkenrath says there's unanimity about this program, i don't think so. %$* 120
there are 30 bills that have been introduced in congress to try to fix the problem that has now been disclosed not because of openness and checks and balances but because of edward snowden leaking it. %$* 120
and this is a program that the nsa lied to congress to keep secret from us. %$* 120
when the director of national intelligence, james clapper , was asked pointblank, "are you collecting data on millions of americans? %$* 120
" he said-- %$* 120
in congress, under oath, he said, "no.” later he said that was the least untruthful answer he could give. %$* 120
well, i think i can think of two more truthful answers. %$* 120
one would have been, "yes," and the other would have been, "we can't confirm or deny.” but instead he lied to us, lied to us, why, because if we knew that this program was underway, we wouldn't accept it. %$* 120
mike has suggested reasons why you should vote against this kind of spying, because it doesn't work, doesn't make us safe. %$* 120
i'm going to suggest that you should vote against the program because it violates core principles of a democracy, transparency, and privacy. %$* 120
a healthy democracy demands transparency from the government and privacy for the citizens, but it seems that today we have reversed that, with the government demanding transparency from us but insisting on secrecy with respect to the programs that it employs. %$* 120
we should be concerned about this because of the problems that secrecy poses to a democracy. %$* 120
of course there's a role for secrecy in terms of national security, but there's also a role for democracy. %$* 120
and when you have an agency engaging in conduct that the person who passed the law says is totally inconsistent with the law he passed and doing it in secret and lying about it, you have a problem with democracy. %$* 120
national security is a compelling state interest, and it is justifiable to engage in surveillance of a range of kinds in order to keep us safe. %$* 120
but we have a right to have a say in how far the government goes in spying on us and our daughters and our sons and our mothers, et cetera. %$* 120
and we were denied that, say, and denied it in the worst possible way, through secrecy and lies. %$* 120
we should also be concerned about the program because it invades our privacy. %$* 120
privacy is critical. %$* 120
it's essential to human development. %$* 120
it's essential to intimate relations. %$* 120
it's essential to political freedom. %$* 120
people can't speak freely when they fear that the government may well be listening in. %$* 120
now, some people say, "well, you know, if you've got nothing to hide, you've got nothing to fear.” but i think most of us have nothing to hide but most of us nonetheless close the door to our bedrooms, close the door to our house, put password protections on our computers. %$* 120
some of us limit who can be friends with us on facebook. %$* 120
we seal the envelopes that we mail. %$* 120
we believe in maintaining privacy because it's central to human existence. %$* 120
and it's particularly essential to a robust democracy that people have the privacy to engage in political discussion without fear that the government's going to be coming in and invading that privacy. %$* 120
stewart suggests, "well, some-- %$* 120
if verizon has it, why should we be concerned if the government gets it? %$* 120
" well, i think there are a number of reasons we should be concerned. %$* 120
first of all, verizon doesn't collect this data on every person and hold it for five years as the nsa is doing. %$* 120
that's precisely why the nsa is demanding it, because verizon just gets it, looks at it for billing records, and then gets rid of it. %$* 120
second, verizon doesn't have the power to lock you up, it doesn't have the power to indict you, it doesn't have the power to investigate you for tax evasion because it doesn't like your politics, which we've seen this government do in the past. %$* 120
the government does have that power. %$* 120
and, third, verizon doesn't have the incentive to go after its customers in the same way that government unfortunately all too often has an incentive to go after those that are critical of it. %$* 120
and we've seen it-- %$* 120
we saw it in the '60s and '70s with a national security program that ended up focusing on anti-war protesters, civil war-- %$* 120
i mean civil rights activists, martin luther king, and women’s rights activists. %$* 120
so it’s not an abstract concern. %$* 120
it’s a real concern. %$* 120
so i think because the nsa program turns democracy on its head, demanding that our lives be transparent and insisting on secrecy for the government, you should vote against the motion. %$* 120
thank you, david cole. %$* 13
and that concludes round one of this intelligence squared u.s. debate where out motion is: spy on me, i would rather be safe. %$* 13
now you’ve heard the opening round. %$* 13
remember how you voted just before the opening round, because we’re going to have you vote immediately after all of the arguments and after round three, and the team whose numbers have changed the most over the course of your two votes in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. %$* 13
now on to round two. %$* 13
round two is where the debaters address one and another directly and answer questions from me and from you, our live audience here in washington, dc. we have two teams of two arguing out on this motion: spy on my, i’d rather be safe. %$* 13
the team that’s arguing for this motion, richard falkenrath and stewart baker, make the argument that there are no simple answers to this; yes, there is a conflict between privacy and security, but that on the whole the mass surveillance programs such as were exposed in 2013 regarding the nsa and phone records and verizon-- %$* 13
that by and large that those programs work, that they are protected by safeguards. %$* 13
those safeguards are legally sanctioned and the result of years and years of concern about how to incorporate privacy into the activities-- %$* 13
respect for privacy into the activities of the intelligence community. %$* 13
the team arguing against the motion, michael german and david cole, they’re arguing against this motion, spy on me, i’d rather be safe. %$* 13
they’re saying yes, there are threats and there does need to be surveillance, but that basically a government that’s able to fish in this sea of data is a government that’s exceeding its position in democratic society. %$* 13
the violation of privacy goes too far. %$* 13
the failure to be transparent goes too far, and that in any case, the system would be flooded with so much data in such a situation that it actually becomes counterproductive to have that information on citizens who have done nothing wrong. %$* 13
i want to go to the side that’s arguing for this motion, that’s more comfortable with the surveillance programs that are in place, and say to you that your opponents have made the argument that-- %$* 13
well, one of them in particular, he said this program that the nsa conducted really affronted his sense of privacy, just in a very basic way. %$* 13
now you-- %$* 13
your side, you’re not denying the fact that to some degree there is a compromise of privacy. %$* 13
it’s just not enough to count, and i want to know why that is. %$* 13
where is your line, stewart baker, on just how willing to be spied on you are? %$* 13
there’s no doubt that when the government collects data, everybody in the democracy ought to be concerned and want to make sure that it is handled in as privacy-protected a fashion as possible, consistent with actually having it be effective. %$* 118
the difficulty here is-- %$* 118
or the protections here are built in to the back end of the system. %$* 118
that is to say the government has the data, but just because it has it doesn’t mean it’s allowed to look at it. %$* 118
it’s set up a whole set of rules, court enforced, aggressively audited, limited number of people who can get access to this data, and clear rules for when they can do it. %$* 118
to make it much more like the rules that apply to ordinary searches by law enforcement, which is you have a suspicion, and you ask a question about the person or the-- %$* 118
in this case, the phone number that you have a suspicion about. %$* 118
they don’t have any ability to look at people for-- %$* 118
so in answer to my question, if the safeguards were not in place, you would have a great deal more concern? %$* 13

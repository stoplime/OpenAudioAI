that sentence, waiting period. %$* 18
please clarify that. %$* 18
and also-- %$* 18
wait, wait, i'm not following your question. %$* 13
oh, the life in prison aspect. %$* 18
you seemed to-- %$* 18
i-- %$* 18
feel it wasn't a punishment aspect. %$* 18
that's right. %$* 18
and to address the nature of the simply-- %$* 18
the freedom itself being taken away. %$* 18
i felt like that was somewhat dismissive and that i would like clarification on how-- %$* 18
so, you're questioning-- %$* 13
you're saying, "come on, robert, are you really telling me life without parole is the party you're describing? %$* 13
yeah, because the media presents it as a differently. %$* 18
okay, and your point is that the media makes it seem like it's not so nice? %$* 13
yeah, exactly. %$* 18
i'm actually-- %$* 13
i actually am a little bit between the two of you, because, kent, you got up there and said that if you are convicted of life without parole, your odds of getting a lawyer and getting legal representation are a lot less than if you are sentenced to die, which makes it sound like it's not so great to have life without parole. %$* 13
and robert is portraying it as a sort of-- %$* 13
well, we're talking about different aspects of it. %$* 124
okay. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
so, robert, why don't you take the question then? %$* 13
yeah, we are talking about-- %$* 124
if you're innocent you're better off getting the death penalty in terms of your odds of it being proven-- %$* 124
you being proven innocent. %$* 124
this is the consistency. %$* 124
in terms of the-- %$* 124
i'm not taking anything for granted. %$* 124
i've got it on videotape. %$* 124
i was given privileged access. %$* 124
i have tens and tens and tens of hours of lifer's playing softball, first run movies of group rec, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. %$* 124
the point is that the prison system is being run indiscriminately. %$* 124
it is not on the basis of the nature of the crime you committed. %$* 124
it has nothing to do with that. %$* 124
it has everything to do with how you behave when you're inside. %$* 124
of course it's a loss of liberty. %$* 124
i don't want to spend my life in prison. %$* 124
i'm not saying that that's not punishment. %$* 124
i'm saying that's not punishment enough for the worst of the worst of the worst and it's often much too much punishment for people who've committed relatively trivial crimes and are put into the same prisons-- %$* 124
diann rust. %$* 13
with the same experience. %$* 124
diann rust-tierney. %$* 13
my first observation is that-- %$* 122
my first observation is that the death penalty has to stand and fall on its own accord. %$* 122
the conversation that robert is having about punishment whether it's enough and whether-- %$* 122
it's a whole different conversation. %$* 122
we are here to talk about whether this policy actually advances public safety and it doesn't. %$* 122
the other point i want to make is that, you know, it's not the media is %$* 122
the public when it thinks about the death penalty has to learn more about it. %$* 122
most people don't think about the death penalty and so the support is uninformed. %$* 122
what we're seeing is as things like botched executions explode in the media, as we're hearing about states going and getting drugs to kill people from the back of a driving school and all these crazy things, the public is starting to focus on it and when they focus on it they see that they don't like it. %$* 122
so, that's why we're seeing state after state that examines this practice decide hmm, we don't need this. %$* 122
that's why we're seeing the public support for the death penalty continue to decline. %$* 122
it's no magic that the media is doing. %$* 122
it's no magic that i'm doing. %$* 122
when you look at this system and you really understand how it works, you cannot support it. %$* 122
you cannot square it with our other values. %$* 122
i'd like to just-- %$* 123
very quickly. %$* 13
what the questioner said is very important because something that should be corrected. %$* 123
i understand, bob, that in your view life in maximum security prisons is not harsh enough punishment for people, and you've described what you think would be harsher punishment, but i can tell you from all the clients i've represented, all these exonorees that i've talked with about what their prison experiences were like and some knowledge of maximum security prisons and familiarity with the literature, it's a terrible place to be. %$* 123
you wake up every morning. %$* 123
you have no idea who's going to kill you and when. %$* 123
you walk into the lunchroom. %$* 123
you look at somebody wrong, you can get stabbed. %$* 123
i mean, there are gangs in prison. %$* 123
there's horrible violence in prison. %$* 123
you know, they should be safe, and that is why the correction people, bob, tell you that they're interested in keeping it safe and that is their job. %$* 123
and so the whole characterization of maximum security prison is, you know, club fed or something-- %$* 123
it's just really misleading and wrong. %$* 123
under court order i went into every maximum security prison in illinois with a video camera. %$* 124
illinois is not-- %$* 124
and also not everyone, but most of them in oklahoma. %$* 124
these are not known as warm and fuzzy states. %$* 124
the number of stabbings inside the maximum security prisons are negligible. %$* 124
the-- %$* 124
in those, now i've not been to every state of course, and some are worse than others, but the point is not that, barry. %$* 124
the point is this. %$* 124
why are we having the same day-to-day lifestyle for the worst of the worst of the worst, and that's why, diann, you're wrong. %$* 124
this is relevant. %$* 124
okay. %$* 13
i'm going to stop this. %$* 13
diann, you're right that we are kind of getting off the point of whether to abolish the death penalty. %$* 13
i'm going to take one more question. %$* 13
sir, right here. %$* 13
sorry. %$* 18
hi. %$* 18
david seaburg and i am for the death penalty. %$* 18
question to barry, actually. %$* 18
i mean, you talk about prisons being so harsh and, you know, painful for these people that experience that. %$* 18
why isn't that a deterrent for criminals, one, but when you're talking about-- %$* 18
wait. %$* 13
i'm going to give you one question. %$* 13
is that your best one? %$* 13
well, no. %$* 18
i have another one actually. %$* 18
all right. %$* 13
we're going to not do the first one. %$* 13
we're going to do this one. %$* 13
when you talk about-- %$* 18
as a deterrent, right, when you think about measuring deterrents, whether or not it actually is effective or not, we're talking about murderers. %$* 18
we're talking about people that have gone out and taken lives of other people, innocent human beings. %$* 18
they're irrational. %$* 18
you can't possibly deter an irrational person in this world. %$* 18
it's just an absolute farfetched-- %$* 18
okay, barry scheck. %$* 13
can you deter a person that's irrational? %$* 13
well, i think your-- %$* 123
both parts of your question, i think, kind of make our point on the issue of deterrence, which is-- %$* 123
that's what the studies show. %$* 123
i mean, that there is no evidence that you can deter somebody that is going to commit a murder for irrational reasons-- %$* 123
many homicides and family situations. %$* 123
that's not how deterrence works, and you don't get it from the threat of capital punishment. %$* 123
and so, you know, that's-- %$* 123
kent-- %$* 13
so, capital punishment is not the answer on the issue of deterrence. %$* 123
kent scheidegger. %$* 13
and that's why second-degree murder is not a capital offense. %$* 125
i mean, we do divide murder into degrees for exactly that reason. %$* 125
the heat of passion killing is not a capital offense. %$* 125
we reserve capital punishment for the worst crimes. %$* 125
a person who commits torture does this crime methodically. %$* 125
and he knows what he's doing. %$* 125
and he's thinking about what he's doing. %$* 125
and these are not irrational in the sense that a person doesn't know what he's doing and doesn't know the consequences. %$* 125
they are bizarre and they are demented, but they are not irrational. %$* 125
and that concludes round 2 of this intelligence squared u.s. debate, where our motion is, "abolish the death penalty." %$* 13
and remember how you voted just before the debate began. %$* 13
immediately after closing statements, which will be brief-- %$* 13
they'll be two minutes each-- %$* 13
we're going to have you vote again, and then we will produce the results of your vote. %$* 13
onto round 3.our motion is this: abolish the death penalty. %$* 13
round 3, closing statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
here to summarize his position supporting the motion to abolish the death penalty, barry scheck. %$* 13
barry, you can sit on this one. %$* 13
we'll sit-- %$* 13
barry scheck. %$* 13
he is co-founder and co-director of the innocence project. %$* 13
let's not be abstract. %$* 123
shuja graham, byron halsey, please stand. %$* 123
i want you to see these two people. %$* 123
this is not the cost of doing business. %$* 123
this is not collateral damage. %$* 123
shuja graham was sentenced to death in california for murder in prison. %$* 123
he was exonerated in 1981.he has been out since then. %$* 123
he is vice-chair of the group witness for innocence. %$* 123
byron halsey, my dear friend, was convicted of murder, a crime that-- %$* 123
in new jersey-- %$* 123
i think, our opponents would immediately say, "this should have been a death penalty crime."two children that-- %$* 123
of byron's girlfriend were found murdered in a basement, one with a nail in her head, one sexually assaulted. %$* 123
he was tried and convicted. %$* 123
he was miraculously saved from the death penalty by one juror who was probably motivated by a conscientious objection to the death penalty. %$* 123
but dna evidence, after 22 years in prison, demonstrated that byron was innocent and identified the person who really committed the crime. %$* 123
so, don't tell me that there isn't an unacceptable risk of executing the innocent. %$* 123
it's been demonstrated-- %$* 123
the innocence movement has demonstrated it. %$* 123
it's not just the 326 dna exonerations that they can't refute. %$* 123
it's not just the over 1,500 exonerations from the registry of-- %$* 123
including non-dna cases. %$* 123
we now know that our system is riddled with error. %$* 123
you go to europe. %$* 123
60 percent of people there still think capital punishment is a morally appropriate sanctioned for the most heinous of crimes. %$* 123
but they don't trust the state to get it right. %$* 123
and that is what we have to come to terms with in this country-- %$* 123
you can't start saying, "we can fix it. %$* 123
we can make it perfect," when nobody's willing to put up the money, and it's an impossible task to begin with. %$* 123
capital punishment is a government program. %$* 123
skepticism is in order. %$* 123
conservatives-- %$* 123
george will said that. %$* 123
thank you, barry scheck. %$* 13
our motion is abolish the death penalty. %$* 13
and here to make his closing statement against the motion, kent scheidegger. %$* 13
he is legal director of the criminal justice legal foundation. %$* 13
among my clients and among my comrades in this struggle are parents whose sons and daughters have been murdered. %$* 125
there is phyllis loya, whose son was a veteran and a police officer, murdered in the line of duty, just a few months before his own son was born, a boy now growing up without a father. %$* 125
there's marc klaas, whose 11-year-old daughter was kidnapped out of her own bedroom by a habitual criminal and murdered. %$* 125
there's sandy friend, whose 10-year-old son michael was abducted, raped, and tortured for 10 hours before he was murdered. %$* 125
there is no doubt of guilt in any of these cases. %$* 125
these parents have waited too long for justice already. %$* 125
and i ask you, do not slam the door of justice in their face. %$* 125
vote no on this motion. %$* 125
thank you, kent scheidegger. %$* 13
and the motion is abolish the death penalty. %$* 13
and here to summarize her position in favor of the motion, diann rust-tierney. %$* 13
she is executive director of the national coalition to abolish the death penalty. %$* 13
you must vote in favor of the motion to abolish the death penalty because it is inconsistent with the fundamental reality and core value of our society. %$* 122
all human beings are capable of change. %$* 122
that capacity to change is a fundamental value underlying our criminal justice system which is designed not just to punish but to rehabilitate. %$* 122
we believe that there should always be the opportunity for redemption, rehabilitation, and even grace. %$* 122
and the death penalty cuts that opportunity off. %$* 122
the choice is simple. %$* 122
do we continue down a path that has continued consistently to produce results? %$* 122
do we continue with an institution that harms and traumatizes people? %$* 122
i've met and talked to the people that the death penalty harms and traumatizes, prison workers, defense counsel, prosecutors, judges, the condemned, and families of the condemned, jurors, and survivors of homicide. %$* 122
regardless of whether a victim supports or opposes the death penalty, if you listen carefully to their voices, one message comes through, "it hurts. %$* 122
the death penalty process by its very nature hurts." it is the nature of the beast, therefore, it must be abolished. %$* 122
i urge you to vote in favor of the motion to abolish the death penalty. %$* 122
thank you, diann rust-tierney. %$* 13
and that is the motion, "abolish the death penalty." and here to make his closing argument against the motion, robert blecker. %$* 13
he is a professor at new york law school. %$* 13
moral facts exist. %$* 124
this is not ultimately just a matter of opinion. %$* 124
i think that might be common ground with at least three of us. %$* 124
the past counts. %$* 124
it counts independently of the future benefits that derive from our actions. %$* 124
we make a covenant between the living, the dead, and the unborn. %$* 124
and so you can't use a cost benefit calculus, not appropriately, not if you're seeking justice. %$* 124
punishment must be limited, and it must be proportionate. %$* 124
it must be deserved. %$* 124
it must be proportionate to the culpable mental state. %$* 124
it must be proportionate to the experience of the victim. %$* 124
the worst crime deserves the worst punishment. %$* 124
we can define them in advance. %$* 124
we can enumerate the worst of the worst of the worst. %$* 124
life without parole as presently experienced and administered is the only alternative, and it's a bad one. %$* 124
there is no adequate substitute for the worst of the worst of the worst but death. %$* 124
the question's been phrased, as has been pointed out, so that it's a double negative on our part. %$* 124
so, when you vote in the negative, you are really voting to uphold something. %$* 124
you're upholding the victim. %$* 124
you're upholding a sense of justice. %$* 124
you're upholding a sense of proportionality. %$* 124
you're ultimately upholding human dignity. %$* 124
we've seen some victims of the process stand up. %$* 124
i have no doubt that they are innocent. %$* 124
but you can't see the victims stand up who have been tortured, mutilated, raped, and murdered. %$* 124
we as a society have to be a voice for those victims for the worst of the worst of the worst and give them the only punishment that they deserve, which is death. %$* 124
thank you, robert blecker. %$* 13
and that concludes closing statements in this intelligence squared u.s.debate, where our motion is, "abolish the death penalty." and now it's time to see which side you feel has argued the best. %$* 13
we're going to ask you to go again to the keypads at your seat and vote a second time on this motion, "abolish the death penalty." remember, if you agree with the motion to abolish, push number one, or if you've been persuaded to it, push number one. %$* 13
if you've been moved to the other side or are remaining there, push number two. %$* 13
and if you remain or became undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and as i said before, you can ignore the other keys. %$* 13
they're not live. %$* 13
and you correct your-- %$* 13
if you make the-- %$* 13
a mistake, just correct yourself. %$* 13
the system will lock in your last vote. %$* 13
and while that is happening, i would just like to say that this was a-- %$* 13
this was a very, very hard-fought debate, and, in fact, the morality and the policy issues were impossible to disentangle from one another, and i think that's to the benefit of the conversation that we saw here but it was also greatly supported by the fact that all four of these debaters came to each other with the position of respect and dignity. %$* 13
they heard each other, even to robustly disagree with each other, but that's the essence of what a debate is, so our congratulations to the way all of you did this. %$* 13
and i also have to say this, the audience questions, fruit based or not, were-- %$* 13
spectacular tonight. %$* 13
they really, really stirred this debate and got it to better places. %$* 13
so thank you, everybody who got up and asked a question. %$* 13
i wanted to tell you about our upcoming debate, and i had a card on it which i-- %$* 13
may have disappeared well, in-- %$* 13
what's the date of the may debate? %$* 13
may 13, we're going to be back here, and the motion we're debating is, "smart technology is making us dumb." %$* 13
and we have a terrific panel on that one, and we would love to have as many of you who would be there plus everybody watching on live stream to join us again for that debate. %$* 13
it's one that we all connect to, and i think the motion tells its own story. %$* 13
it was actually suggested to me by a friend of mine who is here tonight, who i will not call on, but it-- %$* 13
see, if you do pitch ideas to us, they do come around. %$* 13
so, the other thing i want to talk about is the fact that, as i said at the beginning, intelligence squared u.s.operates as a philanthropy, and your ticket purchases are very valued by us not only because they get you in our seats and get you in our audience and get you to vote and help the process along, but also because it supports what we do, but the ticket sales don't come close to covering what it costs. %$* 13
and i'm saying that because there's a way to donate to the intelligence squared enterprise by going to our website online, and we would appreciate if you could do that and participate in that way. %$* 13
the other thing is, as i said at the beginning, we are-- %$* 13
exist as a podcast, and that's very easy to find these days, thanks to a quite gorgeous app that you'll find in the apple store and in google play as well. %$* 13
if you download the app, you can see all of the debates we've ever done, which i think now number 103, 104 as of tonight. %$* 13
and-- %$* 13
see, i keep looking down here because everything that i say is told to me by somebody down here. %$* 13
it all-- %$* 13
i'm-- %$* 13
it's the telepathy thing. %$* 13
but you can see all of our debates, including the research, the background material, and all of the topics we do. %$* 13
so, if you're interested in these debates, you can watch them or listen to them on your phone. %$* 13
all right, let's get to the final results now. %$* 13
it's all in. %$* 13
the motion goes like this. %$* 13
it's, "abolish the death penalty," and as i said at the beginning, that's our motion. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers changed the most between the first and the second vote will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so, here's the results from the first vote, 49 percent agreed with the motion to "abolish the death penalty," 17 percent were against, 34 percent were undecided. %$* 13
that's the first vote. %$* 13
in the second vote, the team arguing for the motion, their second vote was 54 percent. %$* 13
that means they gained 5 percentage points, which is the number to beat. %$* 13
the team against the motion, their first vote 40, second vote was 40 percent, that's an increase of 17 percent. %$* 13
that means the team arguing against the motion to "abolish the death penalty," has won this debate. %$* 13
our congratulations to them. %$* 13
thank you from me, john donvan, and intelligence squared u.s. we'll see you next time. %$* 13
everybody hang on. %$* 13
apparently your host made a mistake. %$* 13
you said them incorrectly. %$* 19
i said the numbers incorrectly? %$* 13
oh, okay. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
so, is everybody going to pretend that the last two minutes just didn't happen? %$* 13
you don't have to go along with this, but just don't giggle. %$* 13
i'm going to read it again so that we can edit it into the podcast. %$* 13
so right now isn't even happening. %$* 13
here we go. %$* 13
so i'm going to give the final results. %$* 13
in the vote-- %$* 13
the final vote, the second vote-- %$* 13
okay, let's see. %$* 13
against the motion, the first vote was 17 percent, the second vote was 40 percent. %$* 13
that is an increase of 23 percent. %$* 13
that is what it takes to win the debate. %$* 13
our congratulations to that side. %$* 13
thank you from me, john donvan, and intelligence squared u.s.we'll see you next time. %$* 13
and thank you for great , great questions tonight. %$* 13

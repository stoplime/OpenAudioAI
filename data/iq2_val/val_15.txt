it is the ninth- most populous country in the world. %$* 107
it’s not a small country-- %$* 107
150 million people or so. %$* 107
if russia is a marginal power, what’s a non-marginal power? %$* 107
do our debating colleagues think only the united states is not a marginal power? %$* 107
and, finally, the environment-- %$* 107
the environment. %$* 107
russia emits one-quarter of all the carbon emissions on the globe. %$* 107
how can we say it’s marginal when it has that effect on the environment? %$* 107
i conclude with ukraine. %$* 107
our colleagues argue that russia is a marginal country. %$* 107
do you think the ukrainians who just lost a part of their country the size of massachusetts through the intervention of russian military forces believe it’s marginal? %$* 107
is that why the president of the united states has spent a total of five hours speaking with the russian president in the last 10 days to try persuade the russian president to withdraw those forces. %$* 107
is that why the american president this afternoon saw the ukrainian prime minister? %$* 107
could that have happened? %$* 107
would that be happening if russia were a marginal power? %$* 107
woody allen once bragged-- %$* 107
resident of this city-- %$* 107
once bragged that he'd taken a 20-minute speed reading course, and read one piece in 20 minutes. %$* 107
and somebody asked him, what was it about? %$* 107
and he says, "it was about russia." i think that our colleagues debating for this motion have taken a strategic speed-reading course to come to the conclusion that russia is a marginal power. %$* 107
thank you. %$* 107
thank you, robert blackwill. %$* 13
and that concludes opening statements in this intelligence squared u.s.debate, where our motion is: russia is a marginal power. %$* 13
now we move on to round two. %$* 13
round two is where the debaters address one another directly, and they take questions from me and from you in our audience here in new york city. %$* 13
we have two teams of two arguing for and against the motion, russia is a marginal power. %$* 13
the team arguing that russia is a marginal power, ian bremmer and edward lucas. %$* 13
we've heard them argue that russia could be a great nation, but it fails to meet that bar, that it has squandered the opportunities that it has innately and that have been given to it since the end of the cold war. %$* 13
the nation is paranoid. %$* 13
it contributes very little to the solving of great problems in the world; that russia doesn't really want responsibility in the first place. %$* 13
it doesn't want to play as a responsible member of the international community. %$* 13
the team arguing against the motion, peter hitchens and robert blackwill, they argue two ways on this one. %$* 13
one of those partners argues that the anti-russian narrative being heard from their opponents is in itself a sort of nostalgia for the cold war and a yearning for an enemy. %$* 13
more specifically, though, they argue that trying to define what-- %$* 13
what russia is in terms of greatness or marginality, issues like friendship are irrelevant, that a nation that has nuclear weapons, a nation that can destroy new york city in half an hour, almost by definition is already not a nation that you can call marginal, even if you can't call it a great nation, necessarily. %$* 13
what i find interesting in what we've heard in the opening statements so far-- %$* 13
and this is rarely happens in our debates-- %$* 13
is that the two sides actually, i think, agree a hundred percent on the basic facts about what is happening in russia, that it was a powerful nation, less powerful now, that it is led by a sinister tyrant, that its economy is a bit of a mess. %$* 13
nobody's disagreeing about that. %$* 13
what they're disagreeing about is what these things imply. %$* 13
so i think what we need to do is go through some of the issues that came up and talk about what they imply in terms of greatness or marginality or somewhere in between. %$* 13
let's start with the most obvious: nuclear weapons. %$* 13
robert blackwill, the side arguing against the motion, has said the ability of the soviet union to blow us up and perhaps ultimately their intentions to do so, make them highly, highly relevant to the united states and to the rest of the world. %$* 13
he also points out that that may underwrite the fact that soviet diplomats get attention, they get time in-- %$* 13
sorry, russian. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
did i say soviet. %$* 13
twice. %$* 107
let's go back and do that whole thing over again. %$* 13
for the record, and for our radio listeners, i lived there during the soviets, and i can't get it out of my head. %$* 13
so i mean russian. %$* 13
every time i've said, "soviets" so far, almost all of those times. %$* 13
let's go to the side, though, that's arguing for it, the motion, russia is a marginal power, and take on this issue of nuclear capability that russia still possesses, which your opponents say all by itself makes-- %$* 13
makes it impossible to call russia a marginal power. %$* 13
let's take that to ed lucas. %$* 13
well, as i said, almost my opening words, russia is a nuclear superpower. %$* 106
it's worth bearing in mind, of course, that having the nuclear war heads is one thing, and delivering them is another. %$* 106
and the record of the russian navy, of building new strategic submarines is pretty-- %$* 106
pretty patchy, even by the lamentable standards of defense procurement contracts worldwide. %$* 106
and there's something slightly comic about seeing the old bear bombers which look like something out of dr. %$* 106
strangelove lumbering up to guam and other places in nato air space to try and provoke us and scare us. %$* 106
and you kind of wonder if the rubber bands and gaffer tape or duct tape is still holding it together all right. %$* 106
i worry about the security of the soviet-- %$* 106
russian-- %$* 106
ex-soviet and now russian %$* 106
it’s catching-- %$* 106
yeah, yeah, very. %$* 13
of a nuclear arsenal. %$* 106
but i just want to-- %$* 106
also, if i may, just pick up on one-- %$* 106
i don't really-- %$* 106
but just to the point then, you're saying that that capability is rather irrelevant to-- %$* 13
well, it's there in the sense that if putin goes mad or even madder, yes, he can do a dr. %$* 106
strangelove, and he can blow the world up, and that is indeed something to worry about. %$* 106
but i think you have to ask, how does he use that power? %$* 106
what is he using that power for? %$* 106
how does he take that power and put russia at the center of world affairs. %$* 106
is he helping, for example, to deal with nonproliferation. %$* 106
that would be a really good thing for a nuclear superpower to do, to try to make sure we deal with nuclear proliferation in the middle east, maybe put pressure on north korea so that they don't develop their nuclear. %$* 106
that's what a responsible, what a mainstream nuclear power would do. %$* 106
russia's not involved in that. %$* 106
on the contrary, it's actually constantly threatening to sell advanced systems to iran which will give the iranians more time and more protection for their nuclear program. %$* 106
they certainly played no role in helping to-- %$* 106
okay. %$* 13
deal with north korea. %$* 106
let's take some of what you just said back to robert blackwill, where we hear edward luke was again arguing on this issue of what's marginality? %$* 13
what pushes russia from the center of the game? %$* 13
and he's saying the weapons are irrelevant. %$* 13
it's how they use them. %$* 13
well, first of all, russia is modernizing all three legs of its strategic deterrent, its delivery systems. %$* 107
so those are facts. %$* 107
unlike the united states, russia has active programs, missile programs, submarine programs and aircraft programs to deliver its nuclear weapons. %$* 107
they take it seriously. %$* 107
second, russia is involved in the north korean diplomacy. %$* 107
and third, russia has not delivered advanced air defense systems to iran. %$* 107
they haven't done so. %$* 107
so all three of those facts are wrong. %$* 107
with respect to nuclear weapons and our colleagues admit that it is a superpower. %$* 107
the question again, just to remind ourselves, is not, is russia a responsible power? %$* 107
we all agree it's not a responsible power. %$* 107
and we can list all the different ways. %$* 107
but that's not what the subject tonight is about. %$* 107
it's rather how important a power is it, and the nuclear weapons make it of consequence to the united states. %$* 107
ian bremmer, so take that point that your side made, that in a sense, the responsibility of a nation defines its greatness, its centrality or its marginality in its absence. %$* 13
take that point about why you're, to some degree, hinging your argument on whether russia is a grownup, mature player in the game. %$* 13
i think our argument has a lot to do with whether or not its power is relevant and useable in the world today. %$* 105
i mean, russia is a nuclear superpower. %$* 105
it's also a sugar beet superpower. %$* 105
that's nice. %$* 105
borscht would be unmakable in this country, were it not for russia. %$* 105
the fact is, we're not very concerned about their nukes. %$* 105
for the last ten plus years, we've been most concerned about the war on terror. %$* 105
and just last year, finally, we said, well, you know, we've dealt with al-qaeda at least in terms of the united states, just not for other countries, but now we're much more concerned about cyber as the principal concern for the united states. %$* 105
and, of course, in terms of cyber attacks, the russians have a lot of criminals. %$* 105
but in terms of the potential of a government to engage in cyber attacks against the u.s., that is head and shoulders, neck, body-- %$* 105
it's china above anybody else, above the russians. %$* 105
so, yes, we're not going to deny the fact that russia has 10,000 nuclear warheads. %$* 105
what we are going to say is that alone doesn't actually cut it on the world stage today. %$* 105
we're certainly not acting as if it cuts it. %$* 105
we don't-- %$* 105
our strategic planning as a country and our prioritization and policy is not as if that is the principal thing that we are losing sleep over on a daily basis. %$* 105
peter hitchens. %$* 13
well, i don't actually share this concern about nuclear weapons very much because i've come to the conclusion that they are more or less unusable, and i don't think anybody would-- %$* 108
since harry truman used them, i don't think anybody else will ever do so. %$* 108
it is noticeable what the russians did develop in the first part of the 21st century. %$* 108
but-- %$* 108
but does that mean you're agreeing with your opponent? %$* 13
well, i do. %$* 108
i can't sit here and honestly say that i-- %$* 108
well, i don't believe. %$* 108
but i think it is simply the absurdity in this is not about nuclear weapons as the absurdity is in the wishful thinking of those who would like there not to be a major power on the planet which differs from the united states on a number of very important objectives. %$* 108
and the motion is really about, we wish russia were a marginal power because we would like it to be the case that we could bomb syria as we failed to do. %$* 108
we'd like it to be the case that we could globalize the world and sweep away borders to the extent they have. %$* 108
the argument which is not being had here about ukraine, for instance, is probably not largely known in this country, is the nature of the european union. %$* 108
–it has a sort of supreme soviet with no opposition. %$* 108
it is intensely bureaucratic. %$* 108
it is entirely lawless. %$* 108
it is monstrously corrupt. %$* 108
and this is-- %$* 108
this is the body which we were supposedly-- %$* 108
what does that have to do with our motion? %$* 13
it has to do with the fact that there was-- %$* 108
what has provoked the immense international crisis in which we now find ourselves is not a struggle between freedom and tyranny. %$* 108
it's a struggle between two power blocks. %$* 108
and one power block is in favor of globalism and the sweeping away of borders. %$* 108
and one power block is in favor of national soviet-- %$* 108
okay, you're-- %$* 13
you're-- %$* 13
in a broad way, your opponents are sort of arguing that russia is not very good at being very good at anything. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 108
i'm saying it's very good at standing up for national sovereignty. %$* 108
the issue of ukraine’s international sovereignty is easily resolved. %$* 108
ukraine is an artificial nation created at the nadir of russia's fortunes. %$* 108
had it been that the united states had gone through a tremendous crisis in 1991 in which mexico had been able to seduce the four states, which the united states took from it in 1848, back into some kind of independent republic, allowing the united states navy use of san diego, you'd have roughly the same circumstances, and you'd view it very much the same as the russians. %$* 108
okay. %$* 13
i want to go edward lucas. %$* 13
i want to point out that this audience is going to vote on whether-- %$* 13
on this motion whether russia is a marginal power or not. %$* 13
and-- %$* 13
i just think this stuff is interesting, that's all. %$* 108
yeah, but you've got a partner there you want to back up. %$* 13
edward lucas. %$* 13
when i was reading up for this debate, i came across a particularly good quote which i think exemplifies a very important point. %$* 106
it goes like this: “the idea that you can intervene in another country because you don't like its regime is wrong, dangerous, and should be opposed. %$* 106
that is why i like vladimir putin.” that's what peter hitchens said in his talk at bristol. %$* 106
it's very interesting. %$* 106
everyone's in favor of this until you come to a case you don't like. %$* 106
and i think the idea that you can just dismiss ukraine as an artificial country is extraordinary. %$* 106
and i wonder how-- %$* 106
is anyone in the audience here from ukraine, by the way? %$* 106
yeah, do you think that it's a marginal country? %$* 106
do you think ukraine is a real country? %$* 106
yes, you do. %$* 106
you're nodding. %$* 106
you think so too. %$* 106
this guy's not sure. %$* 105
for the sake of the radio audience, about three of the 500 hands went up. %$* 13
are you done? %$* 13
i'm not. %$* 106
but i will give way to you. %$* 106
i want to get-- %$* 106
all right. %$* 13
robert blackwill. %$* 13
to discussing more important-- %$* 106
well, perhaps i am eccentric, but i can tell the difference between a nuclear weapon and a sugar beet. %$* 107
and as for cyber, the morning new york times reports that there are major cyber attacks emanating from russia against ukraine today. %$* 107
so to dismiss russia's impact on the future of ukraine as if it were not perhaps even the most important actor outside ukraine on the future of ukraine, seems to me quite myopic. %$* 107
ian bremmer. %$* 13
i cede to the ambassador that a nuclear weapon is not a sugar beet. %$* 105
look, the question is not, do nukes matter? %$* 105
the question is, how important do we actually estimate russia's capabilities broadly for-- %$* 105
since the cold war is over, gallup has taken a poll of all americans asking, open-ended question, who do we think of as our principal enemy? %$* 105
right? %$* 105
they probably even asked romney at one point, right? %$* 105
they got the russia answer. %$* 105
but not from anybody else. %$* 105
china-- %$* 105
china most recently was number one. %$* 105
before that, it was iran. %$* 105
and the only other countries that ever make it into the top four are iraq and north korea. %$* 105
we're just not that worried. %$* 105
look, when obama came in, we sent over, as ambassador to russia, mike mcfaul, guy i know very well, very capable guy, former stanford prof. %$* 105
did his phd with me in stanford, and is absolutely prodemocracy, pro-opposition. %$* 105
first day he goes over to moscow, what does he do? %$* 105
he meets with the opposition, clearly a red rag to a ball, right? %$* 105
i mean, we never would have done that with china. %$* 105
we never would have sent over someone who would offend them that much. %$* 105
why not? %$* 105
because we care about china. %$* 105
because china matters. %$* 105
it's big. %$* 105
i mean, there is a major power out there that doesn't agree with us on things. %$* 105
it's called china, right? %$* 105
we don't-- %$* 105
hillary clinton said, you don't preach human rights to your banker. %$* 105
that's what hillary said. %$* 105
right? %$* 105
hillary just compared putin to the fuhrer, right? %$* 105
why? %$* 105
because she can, because russia doesn't matter as much to us. %$* 105
that's the way we perceive it, right? %$* 105
and perception is a part of reality. %$* 105
okay. %$* 13
let me step in here because that's a really interesting point i want to bring back to robert blackwill or peter hitchens if you want to jump in on it as well, that in fact we are-- %$* 13
russia is a marginal power with the evidence being the way that we all treat it. %$* 13
and there's a logic to that. %$* 13
it's-- %$* 13
well, there may be a logic. %$* 107
it's mistaken if there is such a logic. %$* 107
empirically, as i said, the american president, the british prime minister, the german chancellor, the italian prime minister spent hours on the phone we all know with putin, trying to persuade him to change russian policy toward ukraine and the crimea. %$* 107
you don't do that. %$* 107
these busy, busy leaders don't do that with a marginal power. %$* 107
they do it with a country they know is going to be crucial in the future of an important country that has 40 million people, is geopolitically in a crucial place on the hinge between western, eastern europe and out to eurasia and so forth. %$* 107
so it-- %$* 107
they're not being treated by the international system as if they're marginal. %$* 107
and they're finally-- %$* 107
perhaps partly because we're in new york, we return to the security council. %$* 107
we cannot get our way in the security council without russia-- %$* 107
okay, robert-- %$* 13
and without russia, we act often outside international law. %$* 107
robert, what you've done, you've just come up with a term that i think helps steer this debate because you-- %$* 13
the two of you-- %$* 13
neither of you want to argue that russia is a great power, but you just used the word "crucial," which fights the word "marginal" very, very well. %$* 13
so i want to take that back to edward lucas. %$* 13
in the definition that was just given by your opponent about russia being a crucial power, geographically and in time and place. %$* 13
edward lucas. %$* 13
well, russia's clearly a crucial part if you are living in crimea right now, and if you're worried about the security of ukraine. %$* 106
but russia's not a crucial part on all the stuff that we would be doing if russia wasn't being such a nuisance. %$* 106
and i think this exemplifies what putin does. %$* 106
he craves attention. %$* 106
he longs to be able to say, to the russian people, i'm standing toe to toe with the united states. %$* 106
all these foreign leaders are calling me. %$* 106
i'm really important. %$* 106
and it's almost a behavior of a sort of disturbed adolescent. %$* 106
he's just sort of, you know, locking himself in the bedroom because he loves hearing the grownups pounding on the door and saying, "don't play with those matches, "and "what have you done with the kitchen knife? %$* 106
" it's deranged delusional behavior from somebody who doesn't understand that the world has changed. %$* 106
peter hitchens, is that-- %$* 13
he's-- %$* 106
perhaps-- %$* 106
just a moment. %$* 106
these are tactical triumphs. %$* 106
they're strategic blunders. %$* 106
he's marginalizing russia and leaving out of the mainstream on the margins of everything that actually matters in the world. %$* 106
peter hitchens. %$* 13
i just would like to comment on this hillary clinton referring to vladimir putin as a fuhrer. %$* 108
there's this curious template in discussing foreign policy of the second world war. %$* 108
and usually, what it means is the person who's making the argument says, "he is hitler. %$* 108
you're neville chamberlain, and i am winston churchill. %$* 108
hear me roar." this is dribble. %$* 108
there are many, many other characters in foreign policy. %$* 108
and one of them is woodrow wilson who nobody ever mentions, who created, pretty much, the second world war by drawing foolish, unsustainable borders all over europe, which have now been entirely abolished by the european union, by the way, under the agreement, which were, of course, the principal cause of the second world war. %$* 108
and what we did to russia was a mistake. %$* 108
this idea that russia is a marginal power, which is why it is a stupid idea and why you should reject it, was put forward in the chancelleries of the west when russia was lying flat on its back at the collapse of the soviet union in 1991, when nato was pushed right up to the borders of russia, something which all russians believe they were promised would never happen. %$* 108
and this-- %$* 108
this foolish treatment of russia, this belief that it's a marginal power is a mistake, and it will rebound on us. %$* 108
it has rebounded on us in the ukraine. %$* 108
it is rebounding on us in crimea. %$* 108
it will rebound on us in many, many other ways. %$* 108
if we started treating it more sensibly as the sort of power that it is, we wouldn't have these problems. %$* 108
and peter-- %$* 13
this is fuhrerization. %$* 108
and peter, your-- %$* 13
in a response also to your opponent edward lucas' description at what's motivating putin. %$* 13
if you don't remember-- %$* 13
oh, i think it’s childish. %$* 108
you can look around the world. %$* 108
this is amazing the bad press that putin gets. %$* 108
it's entirely deserved, but it's-- %$* 108
all defenders of israel will know this too. %$* 108
the selective criticism, and there's genuine criticism. %$* 108
if people are criticized for things which other people are doing by people who then don't criticize the other people, that's not the reason for the criticism. %$* 108
there is a man called recep tayyip erdogan, who is in charge of turkey, who locks up journalists in large numbers, who stages show trials of his political opponents, whose country and government is fantastically, spectacularly corrupt. %$* 108
he is our ally and friend, praised weekly in the economist magazine in which i believe edward-- %$* 108
edward is a prominent figure. %$* 108
and never a word, never a word. %$* 108
one of his big-- %$* 108
he kills his own people. %$* 108
one of his victims of the attacks in the square demonstrations died yesterday as a result of having a tear gas canister fired on the side of his head. %$* 108
but there were many more than that. %$* 108
this is a disgraceful person. %$* 108
but-- %$* 108
from the economists and the globalizers with him because he is in favor of globalization. %$* 108
he is in favor of away borders so-- %$* 108
all right, ian bremmer. %$* 13
ian bremmer. %$* 13
i'm on a magical mystery tangent here, and i think it's relevant, i just need you to be a little bit terse on the divergence. %$* 13
ian bremmer, ian bremmer, now, your partner has said that the ukrainians at this moment would find the russians crucial. %$* 13
the syrians at times have found the russians crucial. %$* 13
the iranians at times have found the russians crucial. %$* 13
and my question is how many crucial situations does it take before a nation overall becomes crucial? %$* 13
no, that's right. %$* 105
that's a very good point. %$* 105
and, again, i'd focus on the fact that unfortunately for russia there's been a lot fewer, and they matter more in the global stage. %$* 105
look. %$* 105
i mean, there's no question that the central african republic finds mali crucial right now. %$* 105
that doesn't make me say that mali is a great power, a major power, or something we spend a lot of time on. %$* 105
i think the point that edward made, that putin absolutely desperately demands attention, and he had to, he won-- %$* 105
you know, he had a diplomatic victory, a tactical one on syria. %$* 105
we really-- %$* 105
we got over our skis. %$* 105
we set a red line. %$* 105
we didn't want to do anything, right, because the enemies were as bad as assad from our perspective, right? %$* 105
and so we then tried to back off. %$* 105
we were going to have a vote in congress, and then we weren't really going to have a vote, and then putin says, "ah, let's have a deal." and he couldn't leave it there. %$* 105
he had to write an op-ed in the new york times. %$* 105
you know, it was the most read op-ed in the new york times all year. %$* 105
putin, i do think-- %$* 105
i think as an individual, looking around the whole world, there is no single one person who is more powerful today than putin. %$* 105
i really believe that. %$* 105
he's got an enormous amount of money. %$* 105
he has no checks and balances on his decision making domestically at all. %$* 105
that is at the expense of russian power. %$* 105
his institutions, which had been more consolidated, have weakened. %$* 105
his governors are now directly appointed. %$* 105
his judiciary is a shell of what it was-- %$* 105
hope-- %$* 105
what-- %$* 105
are you not describing in many characteristics the soviet union? %$* 13
no, no. %$* 105
it wasn't-- %$* 13
i mean, it had a nasty leader who was abusive to his people, who didn't run things democratically. %$* 13
yeah, it wasn't personal power. %$* 105
i mean, again, the soviet union in many ways, much similar to what you think about china, it may be authoritarian, the fact is that you have a relative consensus, you can't just move willy-nilly with policy. %$* 105
you could say the stalin period briefly had some of that, but putin is governing over a much smaller place with much-- %$* 105
not just the united states facing him, again, china-- %$* 105
china's so much bigger and a direct security threat-- %$* 105
all right, i'm only interrupting because you've had the floor for a bit. %$* 13
i want to bring-- %$* 13
give robert blackwill a chance, and after that i'd like to start going to questions. %$* 13
so remember, again, raise your hand, let the microphone come to you, state your name, and ask a very terse question that keeps us on this motion about whether russia is a marginal power or if it's more crucial as the word has no emerged in this debate. %$* 13
robert blackwill. %$* 13
well, i just reinforce what ian has just said is that russia under putin is powerful. %$* 107
it's powerful with respect to the future of syria, with the future of iran, and i close by saying, again, this is not a debate about the european union. %$* 107
it's not a debate about china. %$* 107
it's a debate about whether russia is marginal, and i hope when you vote you'll be voting on that. %$* 107
we could also vote on the early movies of steven spielberg-- %$* 107
but i'd like to stick to the subject at hand if we possibly could. %$* 107
let's go to some questions. %$* 13
sir. %$* 13
right there. %$* 13
let the mic come to you, and stand up, and tell us your name, and then go for it. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 109
my name is dr. %$* 109
joshua warrick and my question relates to the significance of american power, especially american military power, announcements that will degrade or decrease our manpower, on the marginality or the significance of russia. %$* 109
that is, as america is uplifted or degraded, what significancedoes that have on our-- %$* 109
do you mean is it a zero-- %$* 13
are you asking whether it's a zero sum kind of thing? %$* 13
no, no, not at all, but what effect will it have? %$* 110
okay, let's go to peter hitchens. %$* 13
i don't know. %$* 108
i just-- %$* 108
i think the problem that has been since the end of the cold war that nobody really knows what the american military is for anymore. %$* 108
and they don't know what to design them for, what sort of wars it's supposed to fight, how to equip it, what should be spent on it. %$* 108
we have a similar much smaller program in my own country where we have a gigantic nuclear arsenal which defends us against enemies we don't have who probably couldn't find us on a map anymore because we're now so insignificant it wouldn't be worth their while bothering. %$* 108
so i think that one of the problems that persists in all foreign policy is trying to work out what sort of world it is, and i think this-- %$* 108
the continued belief that we have of-- %$* 108
we have a major enemy in russia is one of the things which a lot of people in what i think has been called the military industrial complex here rather like to cling to, and it doesn't-- %$* 108
it doesn't actually tally with what's really going on, the real struggles of power which are coming. %$* 108
they're coming as far as i can see in the pacific, where the united states is not particularly strong or particularly well prepared either diplomatically or military for what's coming. %$* 108
and it prefers to divert itself in panics about iran, panics about north korea, and panics about russia. %$* 108
i think it's a mistake on your part that, of course, in 1776 you told us to keep our noses out of your business and i probably shouldn't say any more about it. %$* 108
sir, does that address the dynamic that you were trying to get at? %$* 13
it does, but more specifically-- %$* 110
we need the mic to come back to you. %$* 13
more specifically, for example, the president announced recently we would diminish our troop strength by 100,000 people. %$* 110
he's also said that there's a red line in syria that something would happen if it was crossed. %$* 110
nothing happened. %$* 110
so i don't think that these things really help american power, and i-- %$* 110
in fact, i think they enhance russian significance rather than marginality. %$* 110
in other words, russia can do things now. %$* 110
unless you want to address it, i want to move on to another-- %$* 13
okay, another question? %$* 13
right down front here. %$* 13
hi, my name's tiffany cobb i heard it said to putin, "invading countries is like pringles, he can't just have one." can we talk about what we could expect in the future after ukraine and crimea, if anything? %$* 111
i don't want to do predictions because it really doesn't help us with our voting on the motion of the status-- %$* 13
of the things as they stand out, but thank you for the question. %$* 13
sir, right down front. %$* 13
hi, john-- %$* 112
i need-- %$* 13
everybody, please wait till the mike comes to you because the radio world will not hear you otherwise. %$* 13
hi, john d'agostino to the gentlemen against the motion, it seems like a lot of time was spent defining "what is power? %$* 112
" as with the "ability to disrupt," so be it through nuclear proliferation or nuclear weaponry or-- %$* 112
you didn't mention this but the stranglehold on european natural gas pipelines, if we define a power as the "ability to disrupt," if we expand for that definition, then aren't we opening the door for any rogue state, be it-- %$* 112
i won't get to names, but any rogue state, however small, large, economically important or not, to make themselves a power-- %$* 112
a not marginal power just by being disruptive? %$* 112
great question. %$* 13
robert blackwill. %$* 13
i like the definition. %$* 107
it also, if you'd had more time, would have included the positive things a nation can do in the international system, but i think you put your finger on exactly the kernel here, which is the impact russian external policies and behavior have on the international system and on the united states. %$* 107
and i agree with you and with i think all of us up here that, that's largely negative now, not entirely negative, but largely negative, sadly. %$* 107
so in other words, you're saying that in terms of the plus column that things can do to establish themselves as real powers, the russians aren't doing that well, which is very much what your opponent's argument is. %$* 13
no, it isn't what-- %$* 107
no, i don't think it is what my opponents argue. %$* 107
my opponents argue rather i believe that it has very little impact on the international system, and that it's marginal. %$* 107
and i'm saying quite the opposite, which is countries have choices, and russia has choices, and sadly they've made one choice regarding the crimea, one choice regarding syria. %$* 107
we'll see what they do with iran, but they could make another choice, and it is exactly their capacity to impact the international system in the united states, which supports our opposition to this motion. %$* 107
edward lucas. %$* 13
just two very quick points. %$* 106
first of all, i think i-- %$* 106
it's easy to have a negative impact in the world. %$* 106
you can do negative things very quick. %$* 106
kill all your own people, pollute the environment, do horrible things. %$* 106
what we're arguing is that russia doesn't make a positive impact, and that's the sign of a country of that matters. %$* 106
it's not the ability to be a nuisance, it's the ability to have a positive impact. %$* 106
i just want to pick up on the speaker said about european natural gas. %$* 106
it's absolutely true. %$* 106
russia used to be an energy superpower. %$* 106
and because of the appalling way in which they've treated their customers, they're now seen as an expensive and unreliable supplier of gas, and people are making alternative arrangements. %$* 106
we may even begin to buy from the united states one day. %$* 106
we can get gasses, liquefied natural gas, from all over the place. %$* 106
we're going to develop our own shale. %$* 106
we've got gas coming from algeria, from norway, and everywhere else. %$* 106
and russia's share of the european natural gas market is falling and falling and falling. %$* 106
it's their fault. %$* 106
ian bremmer, very briefly. %$* 13
i just want to say the ability of russia also to do negative things, it's significant compared to the positive, but it's also going down, not just because of the way they've acted on energy but because of the energy revolution. %$* 105
russia is an energy superpower, right-- %$* 105
not anymore. %$* 105
its decreasing prices in europe means the strangle-hold has been reduced. %$* 105
all the european countries are now aggressively renegotiating their contracts with the russians because they have options on the downstream. %$* 105
in the next five years, that’s going to grow dramatically. %$* 105
the single thing that russia really is known for, economically, is energy. %$* 105
and it’s falling apart. %$* 105
meanwhile, what, seven years ago, the russian budget would balance at $34 a barrel. %$* 105
today, it’s $117, okay? %$* 105
that’s huge reduction in capacity to have impact. %$* 105
that’s peter hitchens. %$* 13
can i just take issue with this word positive. %$* 108
it just means what edward likes. %$* 108
and it doesn’t-- %$* 108
it isn’t actually some kind of objective measure of what is good and what is bad. %$* 108
quite a lot of us, for instance, think that the arab spring was not a wild success. %$* 108
many of us thing that turning libya into a filed state with no government was not a particularly clever thing to do. %$* 108
and the destabilization of the syrian regime has reduced millions of people to abject misery, which was completely unnecessary. %$* 108
by standing against these things-- %$* 108
or, indeed, by standing against the idea of carpeting the world with useless windmills or forcing advanced countries to tax their energy industries out of existence in the environmental cause-- %$* 108
some of us think these things are not very clever either. %$* 108
so, to be negative about these things is not necessarily to be bad. %$* 108
it’s rather a good thing that there is an alternative source of-- %$* 108
how shall we say? %$* 108
wisdom in the world from the one which produces those brilliant ideas. %$* 108
let me put to the-- %$* 13
to the-- %$* 13
to the side-arguing against the motion. %$* 13
your opponents have just pointed out that if being an energy superpower is a sign of crucialness of being a player, that the trend for russia is for that slowly to be fading away now that we’re already in that trend and they see it continuing to go. %$* 13
and i’d like you to respond to it, whether that’s a marker of russia’s standing in the world. %$* 13
over the long-term, yes. %$* 107
i agree with you in that, over the long-term, the combination of the mismanagement of its energy sector by the russians and the u.s. energy revolution that’s underway-- %$* 107
the shale revolution-- %$* 107
will reduce the russian capacity to use energy as an instrument of its national purposes, especially against western europe. %$* 107
but that’s 10 years down the way. %$* 107
that’s 10 years-- %$* 107
that’s how long it takes to develop it. %$* 107
i’d just say one other thing, which is this peculiar definition that-- %$* 107
and i take notes-- %$* 107
“countries that matter are ones that pursue positive policies.” what? %$* 107
that’s mary poppins. %$* 107
that’s the strategic rationale of mary poppins. %$* 107
i think that’s rather unfair to mary poppins, actually. %$* 108
another question? %$* 13
is there anyone upstairs that i can’t see, unfortunately. %$* 13
right over in the corner, there. %$* 13
you have a blue shirt. %$* 13
my name is john coleman with the exception of the discussion on the nuclear weapons, i’d like your opinion about what a power really is, whether it’s a local power-- %$* 113
because we’ve talked about things-- %$* 113
well, while russia is a very large country, we’ve talked about things on their border-- %$* 113
versus being a global power and dealing with the rest of the world. %$* 113
you don’t-- %$* 13
you don’t feel that this side has addressed its part in negotiations and-- %$* 13
i mean, it hasn’t only talked about weapons. %$* 13
and we just now talked about the oil and gas industry. %$* 13
and we-- %$* 13
and, again, you know, we’re talking about things that are on their borders. %$* 113
you know, we’ve talked about syria. %$* 113
we’ve talked about the middle east. %$* 113
you know, let’s look at africa-- %$* 113
okay. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13

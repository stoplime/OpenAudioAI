in the corner with the pope and others on that question, but when you're debating a public policy issue about something like this that doesn't work and is causing incredible suffering for the wrongly convicted, even for many families of murder victims that don't find closure in this process and go through it, some do, i just, you know, nobody wants to say that the moral question is irrelevant, but it is a factor to be weighed. %$* 123
that's all. %$* 123
and there are plenty of people on the right that think it's morally wrong to take a life. %$* 123
i just find it a little bit difficult to disentangle from the policy question, for example, and the question i'm going to put to you, robert blecker, where i think i heard you say that if society makes some mistakes and some innocent people do die on rare occasions, as much as you abhor that, that's the price that we need to be willing to pay in order to preserve the right to execute. %$* 13
am i hearing you correctly, that you're willing to pay that price of mistakes being made? %$* 13
in order to preserve the responsibility for justice. %$* 124
but then the question is, what is that probability? %$* 124
what is that threshold? %$* 124
and it-- %$* 124
but let's say-- %$* 13
let's say it's one in a million. %$* 13
let's say it's one in a billion. %$* 13
yes. %$* 124
yes. %$* 124
i mean, we consciously allocate resources in this society. %$* 124
we could make our bridges safer. %$* 124
we could make our roads safer, and we don't. %$* 124
we can statistically calculate how many people will die on the highways that otherwise wouldn't die if we made them safer. %$* 124
we choose to let them die because we think we have other priorities. %$* 124
my point is that justice, which is the second purpose listed in the preamble of the united states constitution, along with "a more perfect union, and general welfare, and common defense," et cetera, et cetera, is a fundamental value that we embrace in this society and that we need to unfortunately take some very small risks. %$* 124
but i would minimize them, and i do have practical solution-- %$* 124
not solutions. %$* 124
practical suggestions for refining the death penalty. %$* 124
let me bring it to-- %$* 13
let me bring diann back in. %$* 13
i would just say, you know, we're talking as if we're-- %$* 122
the only thing out there is the death penalty. %$* 122
the vast majority of homicides do not result in a death sentence. %$* 122
the vast majority of cases that are resolved have justice because people are serving long prison sentences, including life without parole. %$* 122
so, the idea that unless we have the death penalty, we cannot have justice, is just a false premise. %$* 122
for the vast majority of homicides, yes. %$* 125
life in prison is justice. %$* 125
but for a very few, for the worst of the worst, no it isn't. %$* 125
it's not for the marathon bomber. %$* 125
it wasn't for charles manson. %$* 125
he's grinning at us to this day, because we temporarily abolished the death penalty, networking with his fan base on his smuggled cell phone. %$* 125
and he just has not been sufficiently punished and will not be sufficiently punished. %$* 125
barry scheck. %$* 13
well, i-- %$* 123
first of all, i think bob ducked your question about how many-- %$* 123
really? %$* 124
how many innocents-- %$* 123
what is the error rate for executing the wrongly-convicted that would be tolerable in the cost-benefit analysis? %$* 123
and i know that you'd want to see the system perfected, but when you have really good analysis by sam gross in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences, pointing that we have a 4.1 error rate-- %$* 123
percent error rate in capital cases in the united states, i'd submit to you that's really an unacceptable number. %$* 123
that would be 4,000 in a million. %$* 13
but it's actually a number that's not characterized correctly. %$* 124
but we'd be getting into a very complex statistical debate over that, and that-- %$* 124
the audience would be uninterested in-- %$* 124
and i'm probably not qualified to-- %$* 124
well, it's not even a question. %$* 123
do-- %$* 124
you don't even have to characterize it. %$* 123
there's no 4 percent error rate, barry. %$* 124
let's just say-- %$* 123
and you know it. %$* 124
john asked you, if it's one in a million. %$* 123
what if it's 1 in 400? %$* 123
what if it's one in 1,000? %$* 123
i mean, let's get to numbers that, frankly, are pretty close to that error rate. %$* 123
i mean, you know, we're not even getting into-- %$* 123
there's over 1,500 people whose convictions in this country, since 1989, were vacated based on new evidence of innocence. %$* 123
and you may say, "oh, that's two"-- %$* 123
the registry of wrongful convictions says that, and maybe kent will say, "well, not all of them were innocent. %$* 123
maybe some of them just got unfair trials" or something like that. %$* 123
but these numbers are substantial. %$* 123
the 326-- %$* 123
okay. %$* 13
post-conviction dna exonerations, they were all innocent. %$* 123
let's dig down into some of the points that were made earlier. %$* 13
kent scheidegger, your opponents are saying that the deterrence argument is pretty solid, they say, that the science more or less shows that deterrence doesn't work. %$* 13
they cite examples of states that have high murder rates and high-- %$* 13
and the death penalty-- %$* 13
texas, for example, as an example. %$* 13
very compelling argument. %$* 13
what's your response to it? %$* 13
well, actually, it's not a very compelling argument. %$* 125
and if you-- %$* 125
i-- %$* 13
oh, i-- %$* 13
well, i bought it, but-- %$* 13
it's pretty elementary social science that that kind of one-item comparison, between two different groups, is not valid. %$* 125
texas is different from vermont in a lot of ways, besides the death penalty. %$* 125
and you're comparing apples and oranges, to just take that one item, compare two groups, and assume that that difference is what caused the difference in the murder rates. %$* 125
that's the basic problem of correlation and causation. %$* 125
we-- %$* 125
i often hear the argument, "well, you compare the united states and europe, and compare their murder rates." well, you can take the exact same argument and compare europe and japan, and you get the opposite result. %$* 125
so, it is not valid to make that kind of simplistic argument. %$* 125
but-- %$* 123
but one thing that we can all agree on-- %$* 123
because bob believes it, and tell me if you don't-- %$* 123
i'm sorry? %$* 18
that you believe it-- %$* 123
and tell me if you don't-- %$* 123
and i thought you conceded it, ken-- %$* 123
and that is the national academy of sciences, when it looked at all the studies on deterrence, said there is no persuasive evidence that it deters. %$* 123
and my point to you is that if you're going to use the ultimate punishment and you want to justify it on the basis of deterrence when there's no persuasive evidence that it deters, we win that point in the public policy debate. %$* 123
no response to that. %$* 18
robert blecker. %$* 13
well-- %$* 124
robert blecker. %$* 13
well, first of all, in terms of the neighboring states, and the new york times published a famous study about that neighboring states, and the states without the death penalty had a lower homicide rate than the states with them. %$* 124
and they conveniently left out washington, d.c., which is right between virginia and maryland, which at the time both had the death penalty. %$* 124
washington, d.c., did not, and washington, d.c., had a much higher murder rate. %$* 124
now, i was in lorton prison for 12 years and interviewed and spent time listening to convicted killers in d.c.and you read sometimes in the literature that there's no evidence that it deters. %$* 124
well, in fact, one of them told me about a situation in which he broke into the house of a drug dealer expecting many keys of coke and found many keys of heroin. %$* 124
in addition to the keys of coke, had him duct taped and a gun to his head and didn't kill him. %$* 124
and i asked him, "why? %$* 124
what went through your mind at that moment? %$* 124
" he said, "well, when i was a child, i used to look through the window of the d.c.jail and look at the electric chair, and when i was on virginia's penitentiary, i used to sweep the hall and look at the electric chair. %$* 124
and what went through my mind at the moment before i let him live was the electric chair, and that i didn't want to have that." that was half the evidence. %$* 124
the other half was he told me the situation in d.c without a death penalty, same situation, drug dealers had them duct taped, and i said, "what'd you do? %$* 124
" and he said, "i killed them because i can face what they have waiting for me here. %$* 124
i just couldn't face what they had waiting for me there." that's only a single datum, but that is as close as you will ever get to primary evidence that sometimes the death penalty is a more effective deterrent than its alternative, life without parole. %$* 124
diann. %$* 13
but our point is we need more evidence than that, and the burden is on you to show that this is useful. %$* 122
there is no affirmative strong argument or evidence to suggest that the death penalty is a deterrent, and you've admitted that. %$* 122
you said, "it's equivocal, but we should keep going forward," and that's really the public policy question. %$* 122
diann, i want to take to you a point that i believe i understood kent to make, which was that the-- %$* 13
that your side, the abolitionist's side, moves arguments when the data fails your first arguments. %$* 13
and the example he gave was on the race question, where he said, if i have this right, kent, that at one time the argument was that most of the convicts facing-- %$* 13
on death row were disproportionately african-american, but that the argument, failing data confirmation, that you move the argument to "most of the victims are white," and that, that's a little bit of a dance. %$* 13
so, i'd like you to respond both to his point that you're moving the goalpost and just to go to the point itself. %$* 13
i wish i had the power to move goal posts the way kent was talking about, but we don't do that. %$* 122
the facts are the same. %$* 122
what i see is sort of kent looking selectively at the evidence. %$* 122
the case has always been that the death penalty actually tracks our history of racial apartheid when it comes to criminal justice, that the death penalty when we had slave codes actually was meted out based on the race of the victim and the race of the defendant, and even though the slave codes and-- %$* 122
we've made some progress, the-- %$* 122
the process-- %$* 122
the system still works the same way. %$* 122
the core issue is that the death penalty values some lives more than others. %$* 122
and when it comes to the good that our opponents are saying the death penalty offers, that good is only used when the victim is white, because that's where the system currently sees the value lying. %$* 122
and the data is there? %$* 13
and the data is there. %$* 122
and the reason-- %$* 122
okay. %$* 13
because %$* 122
i'll let you finish and then bring it to kent. %$* 13
sure. %$* 122
well, first of all-- %$* 122
finish. %$* 122
no, no, you finish, diann, and then i want kent to respond. %$* 13
there was a recent study that just came out that looked at death sentences from 1976 to 2013, and what that study found was two things, first, that the race of victim discrimination continued, that the least likely-- %$* 122
as i said earlier, the least likely victim for whom the death penalty is sought will be an african-american man even though african-american men are the most likely to be the victims of homicide. %$* 122
and they also found that the defendant-- %$* 122
a defendant who was convicted and sent to death for murdering a white victim who was african-american is far more likely. %$* 122
one other point, prosecutors-- %$* 122
every study-- %$* 122
there's been over 200 studies over 40 years-- %$* 122
every study has found that prosecutors seek the death penalty for crimes against white victims more frequently than other victims. %$* 122
okay, i want to bring this to kent. %$* 13
okay. %$* 125
kent scheidegger. %$* 13
well, first of all, i'm very glad to hear that we are agreed that seeking the death penalty constitutes honoring the life of the victim. %$* 125
i appreciate that you're conceding that point. %$* 125
i've not said that. %$* 122
on the studies, the pattern of offending across racial groups is not uniform. %$* 125
that's a demographic reality. %$* 125
if you take these studies and if they are litigated and if they are reanalyzed, if you have competing experts looking at the same data, what you find over and over again is that when additional factors, legitimate factors explaining the differences between cases are taken fully into account, that these racial differences vanish down into the statistical grass where we can say that it's hardly even apparent there's any effect there. %$* 125
well, in the interest of intellectual honesty on all sides, are you all saying that the data we're talking about can be cooked by either side to produce the results it wants? %$* 13
absolutely not. %$* 122
you're not saying that? %$* 13
40 years of-- %$* 122
40-- %$* 122
we have studied the death penalty in every state that had it 40 years, different researchers, different approaches, and the data-- %$* 122
the outcome is remarkably consistent, remarkably consistent finding racial bias. %$* 122
robert blecker. %$* 13
you'll have to-- %$* 18
oh, barry %$* 13
it's the baldus study in the mccleskey case, that went off on the issue of race of the victim, that is the effect that has been replicated countless times no matter who looks at the data and how often, and that's what you'll find the weight of criminologists and scientists saying, "the race of the victim makes a difference, period." %$* 123
so, let me just bring this back to kent for one more round on this point of-- %$* 13
your opponents are basically saying that the data is really consistent. %$* 13
you're basically saying that it's not. %$* 13
do we just declare impasse on this or is there-- %$* 13
no, this is very soft science. %$* 125
these are mathematical models, and there's a lot of leeway when you put together a mathematical model. %$* 125
and you can choose the variables the way you want. %$* 125
you can get the result you want. %$* 125
what we see time and again is the same authors who have a axe to grind put out study after study. %$* 125
and i do want to mention the baldus study from georgia, that study went to trial in federal district court, and the finding of the federal district court was that baldus's study did not, in fact, prove what he said it proved. %$* 125
robert blecker. %$* 13
yeah, i want to dig down and talk about the meaning of this race of victim effect, if it's real, and i believe it is real. %$* 124
lorton prison was the only all-black prison system in the united states, where i spent 12 years. %$* 124
and i explored this issue in depth. %$* 124
diann rust- tierney says that it shows that if it's more likely, that we will execute the killer of a white than the killer of a black, that means that we devalue black life. %$* 124
that's not true. %$* 124
there are alternative explanations for it. %$* 124
most killings are same-race killings, whites on whites, blacks on blacks. %$* 124
the budget for death penalty trials, which is very high, tends to be more available-- %$* 124
the money is more available in white jurisdictions than black jurisdictions. %$* 124
the odds of picking a jury that'll go death is greater in white jurisdictions, although there is substantial support for the death penalty in a black-- %$* 124
in black communities, it's less than half. %$* 124
it's in the range of 40 to 45 percent. %$* 124
so, what does it really mean? %$* 124
the victim's family is consulted, "do you want me to go death? %$* 124
" if it's been a black victim, often they have a much more nuanced appreciation of what the conditions were that produced that killing. %$* 124
they realize that "there, but for fortune, my child who is now dead could just as easily be accused of the killing because he ran in the wrong crowd, he was part of a drug life, et cetera, et cetera. %$* 124
so why compound the tragedy? %$* 124
" so they will say, "don't go death." that doesn't show that they're devaluing black life. %$* 124
that shows they're continuing to value black life, including the life of the killer. %$* 124
there is-- %$* 124
all right, let me stop you, and let diann respond. %$* 13
you know, we have to keep bringing this back to reality. %$* 122
we're in the midst of a conversation in this country right today where african-americans and people of color do not have the same experience with law enforcement that other people have. %$* 122
and we're telling people that we have essentially two systems of justice, and in that context we cannot have a death penalty. %$* 122
and what we're talking about in terms of years of study is the same science that we use to look at implicit bias generally. %$* 122
it's the same science that we use to determine that there's a glass ceiling for women. %$* 122
it's the same science that we've used to determine that women are not receiving equal pay. %$* 122
i mean, this is not some made-up science. %$* 122
this is how we determine whether a system, even a neutral system, operates in a way that has a discriminatory impact. %$* 122
robert blecker. %$* 13
i-- %$* 124
before you speak, i just want to say after robert speaks, i want to go to you for questions, and i'm telling you this now before robert so you can prepare. %$* 13
the way it will work is i'll-- %$* 13
if you raise your hand, i'll call on you. %$* 13
we would appreciate if you would stand up, wait for a microphone to reach you. %$* 13
they'll be brought to you. %$* 13
hold it about as far away from your mouth as i am with this microphone so that we can hear you on all the podcasts and the radio broadcasts. %$* 13
tell us your name and ask a question that's on point and very terse. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
go ahead, robert blecker. %$* 13
i just want to acknowledge where there is a real race effect in the death penalty. %$* 124
and that's not the way it's administered. %$* 124
it's the way it's defined. %$* 124
that is to say, because felony murder is the most common aggravator, and robbery murders put more people on death row than any other aggravator, and because robbery is an economic crime and correlates with race, that creates the disparity in terms of percentage of population of population of those who are on death row, if you eliminate the robber aggravator from felony murder as a death penalty aggravator you eliminate the racially disparage effect and the other place that it occurs is the place that nobody wants to talk about, but that i became aware of. %$* 124
there is deep prejudice in both the black and the white community against those who have prototypically african features. %$* 124
studies have shown that the hue of the skin, this is true in the black community, as well as the white community, will influence the probability of being convicted and condemned. %$* 124
that is a pernicious form of racism that is extraordinarily troubling and almost impossible to eradicate in both communities. %$* 124
barry scheck. %$* 13
so, i've heard you say this before and it's true, all right, and the-- %$* 123
you say well if we eliminate the felony aggravator then we'll get rid of some of these race effects, which bob, you acknowledge exist in the system, and we've got to be in the real world. %$* 123
that's not happening. %$* 123
oh, i think you're wrong about that. %$* 124
let's go to some questions. %$* 13
right there. %$* 13
and remember, i need you to not make a speech-- %$* 13
but to ask a question. %$* 13
hi. %$* 19
i'm d.c. if you-- %$* 19
this is for the against side. %$* 19
if you are sort of talk so strongly about justice and deterrents, would you then be willing for deterrents in justice to have other ways rather than the death penalty such as caning or cutting off the hand that, you know, may work as a deterrent and maybe bring some kind of justice. %$* 19
an eye for an eye. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
so, that's-- %$* 13
that question is put to the side that's arguing against the motion-- %$* 13
i just want to be clear. %$* 13
that means they are arguing against abolition of the death penalty. %$* 13
would you like to take the question robert? %$* 13
sure. %$* 124
robert blecker. %$* 13
first of all, an eye for an eye is a measure. %$* 124
it's not a justification as is pointed out classically. %$* 124
if a one-eyed person takes out one of two good eyes of a victim he's left him sighted. %$* 124
if you take out his eye you've blinded him. %$* 124
so we've-- %$* 124
i'm sorry. %$* 124
we've traded the notion of proportional punishment. %$* 124
now, to directly answer your question what would i have? %$* 124
no, not physical mutilation by any means, but i would have something that i call permanent punitive segregation, which means life should be unpleasant. %$* 124
the food that they eat every day, i'm talking about the worst of the worst of the worst who are never getting out, they should eat only nutraloaf, which is a tasteless, but nutritionally complete patty, gives you absolutely no satisfaction. %$* 124
i saw komisarjevsky, hayes’ cohort on death row with his hershey bar. %$* 124
he'll wake up, watch a ballgame, and eat a hershey bar. %$* 124
that's wrong. %$* 124
there should be no such thing as play. %$* 124
play? %$* 124
exercise yes. %$* 124
play for the worst of the worst of the worst? %$* 124
absolutely not. %$* 124
are you talking about a life without parole scenario or a death row scenario? %$* 13
i'm talking about both. %$* 124
life without parole is a fundamentally retributive punishment. %$* 124
when we commit someone to life without parole we're saying-- %$* 124
well, your opponents are arguing for life without parole as the alternative to death penalty. %$* 13
yeah, but they're saying live in the real world and then they're ignoring what the real world is for the lifer's who serve life without parole. %$* 124
barry scheck. %$* 13
bob, i mean, people should know your real position and i understand it intellectually. %$* 123
yes, you are saying that, you know, logical extension of your argument is if we had that kind of punitive segregation and-- %$* 123
that that would make life without parole a more acceptable alternative to you than the death penalty. %$* 123
just in case people missed it, you were objecting to the way that lethal injection is done because you don't want people anesthetized so that it looks like you want people to see that there is suffering at the time of the execution. %$* 123
you think that's important. %$* 123
you favor firing squads, right? %$* 123
i do. %$* 124
right. %$* 123
so, let's just look-- %$* 123
i mean, your argument is a retributive argument. %$* 123
you're not arguing deterrence. %$* 123
you're not arguing that there is a high risk of executing innocents. %$* 123
you have a position which i understand, but i actually don't think that that is a generally shared view. %$* 123
i'm sure everybody gets this, but i know that when i was studying for this i stumbled a little bit on the word retributive until i realized doh, retribution, that's-- %$* 13
it's obviously sort of the just desserts argument as kent put it on early today. %$* 13
so, it' s-- %$* 13
again, it does come back to eye for an eye. %$* 13
let's go to another question. %$* 13
down here, sir. %$* 13
thank you to all the panelists. %$* 18
my name is evan katz from manhattan. %$* 18
i've always been anti-death penalty for the reasons we've discussed. %$* 18
there is a debate now going on whether this country and the supreme court should look to other countries at all, somewhat, or a lot regarding what they are doing. %$* 18
and i've got a question for all the panelists, but especially those against the motion-- %$* 18
it seems that most of the rest of the world is going against the death penalty, especially developed nations. %$* 18
and if you look at who's for it, who's against it abroad, the u.s. is much more aligned-- %$* 18
vastly more aligned with the countries that have abolished the death penalty. %$* 18
could the panelists discuss what's going on abroad, and especially the panel against the motion, please? %$* 18
only to the degree that this can be relevant to whether we should abolish here. %$* 13
and i'm not sure that it is. %$* 13
does anybody feel that what's happening abroad is relevant to what we do here? %$* 13
i think-- %$* 122
yeah. %$* 18
do you? %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13
diann rust, take it. %$* 13
well, i would say-- %$* 122
you know, most of our allies who are committed to the advancement of human rights and civil rights really are looking to the united states to abolish the death penalty because we do have a reputation for leading in these areas. %$* 122
and so, i think that in addition to the good that it would do for us to get rid of the death penalty, we could actually make a larger contribution to the broader struggle that many in other countries that you mentioned are fighting. %$* 122
you know, there-- %$* 122
we have a trial. %$* 122
there are people who are sentenced to death without the kind of trial and protections that we have. %$* 122
there are people who are sentenced to death who don't know when they're going to be executed. %$* 122
the guard comes from the-- %$* 122
and those kinds of situations can't really be addressed as long as the united states can be pointed to as still having it. %$* 122
so, there's a very important benefit for us to abolish the death penalty, because we can advance human rights in other places where we could all agree that human rights need to be advanced. %$* 122
we haven't heard from kent in a few minutes, so i'd like to-- %$* 13
okay. %$* 125
hear kent %$* 13
my short answer is no. %$* 125
i think the united states can and should decide this issue for itself. %$* 125
i think it's entitled to decide this issue for itself. %$* 125
as far as examples to other countries, i think we can serve as an example to those countries that don't want to abolish the death penalty, that yes, you can have the death penalty consistently with human rights. %$* 125
we can do that. %$* 125
robert blecker? %$* 13
if you can be brief on this one, because-- %$* 13
sure. %$* 124
you hear "follow europe's lead." let's talk about europe's lead. %$* 124
anders breivik in norway set off a bomb outside the parliament building in oslo, killing eight, then went to an island and killed 69 youths. %$* 124
you know what his sentence was? %$* 124
21 years in prison, the maximum that norway has. %$* 124
but lest you think they're treating him too well, he's right now on a hunger strike. %$* 124
why is he on a hunger strike inside prison? %$* 124
because they're not giving him playstation 3. %$* 124
okay. %$* 13
they're only giving him-- %$* 124
europe has abolished life without parole. %$* 124
do you know that? %$* 124
if we follow europe's lead, we abolish life without parole-- %$* 124
not only have they abolished the death penalty. %$* 124
you don't read that in the times. %$* 124
right down in front, please. %$* 13
hi. %$* 19
my name is %$* 19
i'm interested in something that kent scheidegger said. %$* 19
you said that comparing vermont and texas is not apples to apples. %$* 19
so, i'm wondering, what are the elements that distinguish your examples of vermont and texas as being not apple to apple? %$* 19
and if those elements that are vermont-ish could be replicated in the texas examples, then would that be sufficient to justify abolishing the death penalty? %$* 19
all right. %$* 13
great question. %$* 13
a fruit based question-- %$* 13
but it's actually an excellent question. %$* 13
let's take that to you, kent. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 125
i mean, there's a huge cultural difference between various regions of the country. %$* 125
and the countries that have abolished the death penalty, by and large, are those countries that already had lower crime rates before they abolished the death penalty. %$* 125
it's just built into the whole culture of the state. %$* 125
to do the analysis, you have to try to control mathematically through models for these other factors. %$* 125
and that's what the deterrence studies do. %$* 125
and i think there is a very substantial body of literature showing a deterrent effect through that kind of mathematical modeling. %$* 125
i do not concede that-- %$* 125
what barry said, that there's no good evidence. %$* 125
the report that he refers to says very clearly, in the front matter of the report, that it is simply the personal opinions of the authors whose name appear on that report. %$* 125
there are plenty of other experts who disagree with that, so i think there is a substantial basis, once you do that kind of modeling, to believe that there is a deterrent effect. %$* 125
if i really believe there wasn't a deterrent effect, as things stand now, i think-- %$* 125
i still think that justice would be enough by itself to justify the penalty. %$* 125
barry scheck. %$* 13
oh, giving little ground there on deterrence, i see. %$* 123
but look, the question brings up the statistic i cited at the very beginning. %$* 123
if you have counties-- %$* 123
counties is really what you have to look at, although most of them are in the south. %$* 123
but there are a few that over-produce death in california. %$* 123
if two percent of the counties in this country are producing 56 percent of the death sentences and 52 percent of the executions, when two-thirds of americans reside in counties, where there hasn't been-- %$* 123
there's been one execution or less in 45 years, right? %$* 123
all of a sudden you begin to see-- %$* 123
and it doesn't take much to see it-- %$* 123
that there are just a small number of counties in this country and a small number of states that are engaged in capital punishment in a serious way. %$* 123
another question? %$* 13
ma'am, right down here. %$* 13
yep, that's you. %$* 13
okay, so this is for i guess all the panelists. %$* 19
i-- %$* 13
if you can just sort of throw it out there. %$* 13
i don't-- %$* 13
we don't-- %$* 13
wouldn't have time for everybody to answer. %$* 13
sure. %$* 19
okay. %$* 13
just so a quick question. %$* 19
sure. %$* 13
you mentioned that for someone who's on death row, they have to go through the appeals process and get multiple, you know, government-issued attorneys. %$* 19
do you think, you know, i guess people for the motion, if that’s actually someone, you know, of color or an african-american, if they had a poor attorney given to them from-- %$* 19
for life on parole, and then they got to go through this process, do you think it would be more helpful for getting truly innocent people off? %$* 19
diann rust-tierney. %$* 13
i think one of the sad things about the death penalty is because the punishment is so severe that the limited resources-- %$* 122
as much as barry is able to do with the innocence projects across the country, have to focus on, you know, those people who are sentenced to death. %$* 122
i think if there were no death penalty, there would be many more resources and much more opportunity to look for and address the question of innocence of people who are serving other sentences. %$* 122
you know, keep in mind, there's one underlying theme, we make mistakes, and we're being told that, you know, "well, some mistakes are tolerable," but i think your point is the fact that we have to focus on the death penalty means we cannot focus the resources that we need to address the problem of a system that makes mistakes. %$* 122
barry scheck. %$* 13
and let's be clear about what those costs are. %$* 123
when maryland studied the death penalty before they abolished it, they were able to determine that a capital case was seven times more expensive than a noncapital case, that the executions in maryland averaged $37 million per execution, it's $23 million in florida, it's $185 million in california, and, you know, california's system is completely crazy. %$* 123
there's 734 people on the row, right, hundreds that don't have lawyers, who have been sentenced to death. %$* 123
and there are some pretty good death penalty lawyers there, but there are also some that are not very good. %$* 123
and we can't fund it. %$* 123
i mean, why would you put all this money into propping up a system where they have no persuasive evidence of deterrence, right, that we need all this money to finance an underfunded criminal justice system that has so much to be fixed, particularly when it comes to forensic science? %$* 123
all right, let me-- %$* 13
barry, let me let the other side respond because the question was to all sides. %$* 13
if you'd like to, kent scheidegger. %$* 13
well, yeah, the california one is the one i'm most familiar with, and the study counted in as costs of the death penalty a great many things that are not costs of the death penalty. %$* 125
they're costs of the obstruction of the death penalty. %$* 125
the length of time spent on death row was cited as the number one cost. %$* 125
we spend a lot of money in california going over and over and over the same case, litigating issues that have nothing whatever to do with whether the person is guilty or not. %$* 125
and we have been to the legislature and proposed reforms to fix that. %$* 125
they have been killed in the legislature, but we do have an initiative process in california, and i believe that it will be fixed, and it will be both a better system and a cheaper system. %$* 125
and ultimately the death penalty does not need to cost more than life without parole. %$* 125
i want to remind you that we are in the question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan, your moderator. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, arguing it out over this motion, "abolish the death penalty." and let's go back to some audience questions. %$* 13
sir, right in the middle here, the mic's going to come from your right side. %$* 13
do you see it? %$* 13
excellent questions tonight so far, folks, really. %$* 13
impressive. %$* 18
yeah, yeah, keep it up. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13
this question is for both of those against the motion. %$* 18
i think it was asked several times, but i never really heard an answer. %$* 18
if you accept the fact that there are 4.1 percent of false positives, if you accept that and you accept that, that cannot be changed, does that change your position, and, if not, why? %$* 18
and preferably if both of you could answer that %$* 18
kent scheidegger. %$* 13
if i believed that were really true, i would be against the death penalty. %$* 125
i don't believe it's true, not for a minute. %$* 125
the author who came up with that number is one of the people i've referred to, who just pumps out paper after paper after paper every time supporting abolition of the death penalty. %$* 125
it's easy to cook books in studies like that. %$* 125
robert blecker. %$* 13
i, too, if i thought there were a 4.1 percent true error rate, would be opposed-- %$* 124
would impose a moratorium until we fixed it and there was nothing like that. %$* 124
i don't believe it's anything like that. %$* 124
is there evidence against your side in the fact that so many states have moved to abolish the death penalty and in the-- %$* 13
what your opponents claimed is the preference of police chiefs or the-- %$* 13
or the lack of preference of police chiefs for the death penalty, where they rank it last among the things that are %$* 13
yeah, the death penalty information center surveyed police chiefs because they knew that was where they were likely to get the result they wanted. %$* 125
if you surveyed line police officers, you would get a very different result. %$* 125
when my organization has spoken to police groups, the police officers who were actually on the line actually dealing with the bad guys every day, the support is practically uniform in favor of keeping and maintaining capital punishment. %$* 125
diann. %$* 13
but that-- %$* 122
that-- %$* 122
let's let diann speak. %$* 13
i want to bring it back to what the question was. %$* 122
the question is not-- %$* 122
because many of the people that were surveyed did support the death penalty in theory, but when they were asked from their position of having to manage law enforcement resources and from their experience about what they thought it needed to take-- %$* 122
what it took to make the community safer, they made a choice that said that the death penalty, among all the things that we could have, is the least useful thing that we would need. %$* 122
so, the distinction is not whether these people support the death penalty in theory. %$* 122
the question is whether when you have to make tough choices about resources, whether this is the thing that's going to get the result. %$* 122
and, robert, the part of the question about the fact that states have been moving to abolish more than the other way around. %$* 13
oh, so i don't get to answer that. %$* 124
you know what? %$* 124
i wanted to respond to that in terms of management and resources, but-- %$* 124
and why police chiefs aren't the right people to-- %$* 124
there's an analogy inside the prison about why corrections officers are the last people to ask also about the death penalty, because for them it's a management question and it's much easier to manage without it than it is to manage with it. %$* 124
it's not-- %$* 124
they're not the people to consult about justice. %$* 124
the states are increasingly abolishing the death penalty in my view because they are abetted by the media, which is overwhelmingly anti-death penalty, overwhelmingly, and which skews the perspective on it. %$* 124
you know, just to give you an example of that, the gallup poll from the-- %$* 124
not the latest one, the one before that-- %$* 124
had 60 percent of the american people supporting the death penalty, answering the standard question which they've been asking since 1936.the headlines were, "death penalty support a 40-year low." the next year, last year, the result was 64 percent. %$* 124
so it had risen by 4 percent. %$* 124
what's the headline? %$* 124
"death penalty support stays fairly constant over the last 10 years." it reminds me of the russian report of the famous race, the horserace between the russian horse and the u.s.horse. %$* 124
and the u.s.horse whips the russian horse, and the report the next day is, "in major international horserace, gallant russian horse takes a wonderful second. %$* 124
the u.s. horse gets a disappointing next to last." %$* 124
in the back, sir, can you come down? %$* 13
wait a second. %$* 123
john, john. %$* 123
yeah, i-- %$* 13
i have a %$* 123
i just want to position this gentleman come forward. %$* 13
so, if you can come down a little bit. %$* 13
but let me-- %$* 123
let me-- %$* 123
barry scheck. %$* 13
but let's get to the heart of it now, because let me see if i just heard what our opponents are saying. %$* 123
they're saying, "the last people to ask about whether the death penalty is going to make you safer are police chiefs"? %$* 123
i didn't say that. %$* 124
no? %$* 123
well, kent certainly did. %$* 123
he said, "ask the line cop." here's the point. %$* 123
the reason why police chiefs, who as diann pointed out very frequently would count in the votes, they say, "are you for or against the death penalty in principle or for moral purposes? %$* 123
" and they would say, "yes." but if you ask police chiefs, "should we have the death penalty now? %$* 123
" as a public policy matter, they'd say, "no."and the reason they'd say, "no," are all the issues that we've raised in this debate about public policy, that they see no evidence of deterrence, it's extremely expensive, it's taking away resources they need to keep your community safe, right? %$* 123
what they need to have good crime labs, to have good police officers, to have good training, to make the community safe, they are saying, "this is not helping us, it's hurting us." %$* 123
sir. %$* 13
that has to be respected. %$* 123
i just wanted clarification from robert on-- %$* 18
it's related to the media. %$* 18
and our notion of prison is not the research notion that you have, and i think perhaps you might have taken it for granted that it is a cushy type of-- %$* 18

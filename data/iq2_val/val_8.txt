thank you and welcome, with me is dana wolfe, our executive producer. %$* 1
well, tonight our resolution is, “eliot spitzer should resign.” well—well, okay, we’re not quite that timely. %$* 1
but the issue of tough interrogation of terror suspects is also very much in the news. %$* 1
president bush has just vetoed an act of congress which would have limited the cia to the same interrogation techniques as those approved in the army field manual. %$* 1
but what do these limits amount to, what effect might they have on the information that we can glean about terrorist activity? %$* 1
tough interrogation is not our euphemism for torture. %$* 1
but it does invite discussion about where to draw the line. %$* 1
and terror suspects are not routine criminals. %$* 1
the threats they pose are of a different nature entirely. %$* 1
the discourse on the subject has tended to conflate abu ghraib and guantanamo and waterboarding, and the infamous justice department torture memo. %$* 1
we picture an administration running roughshod over geneva conventions, and our own historic traditions of civil liberties and human rights. %$* 1
more pragmatically, how much useful intelligence has actually been gained, and have the costs in terms of public support for our policies at home and our image as a nation abroad been worth it? %$* 1
on the other hand, it’s easy to forget that the geneva conventions are reciprocal agreements, giving rights to armed soldiers on both sides of a conflict. %$* 1
these rights are conditioned on soldiers wearing uniforms, in order to protect civilian populations from collateral damage, as much as possible. %$* 1
well, how is this relevant to terror groups who don’t abide by geneva principles, who don’t wear uniforms, and whose very purpose is to kill and maim civilians? %$* 1
cia terror interrogation practices are hardly transparent. %$* 1
but military interrogations are governed by very elaborate legal and procedural safeguards. %$* 1
for the military, it’s highly problematic to impose on terror suspects the same physical hardships we use in training our own troops, or the same psychological stress involved in civilian police interrogations, or even the same degree of sleep deprivation experienced by young investment bankers at goldman sachs. %$* 1
we have a superb panel to help us sort out these issues. %$* 1
it’s my pleasure to introduce our moderator, brooke gladstone. %$* 1
brooke is the award-winning host and managing editor of wnyc’s on the media. %$* 1
brooke, the evening is yours, and thank you very much— %$* 1

thank you very much, bob. %$* 92
so i’d like to welcome you all to the eighth debate of the second intelligence squared series. %$* 92
the resolution being debated tonight, “tough interrogation of terror suspects is necessary.” let me give you a brief rundown of the evening. %$* 92
it’s a really interesting format, members of each team will alternate in presenting their side of the argument, those presentations will be limited to seven minutes. %$* 92
when opening arguments are complete i’ll open up the floor to brief questions from the audience, and after the q-and-a each debater will make a final two-minute summation. %$* 92
finally, you’ll get to vote on tonight’s motion with the keypad attached to your armrest, and i will announce your decision on which side carried the day. %$* 92
but, let’s start with a pre-debate vote. %$* 92

okay. %$* 92
and now we’ll start the debate—for the motion, heather mac donald. %$* 92
thank you very much. %$* 93
i will argue that stress interrogation techniques are both necessary for getting information from suspected terrorists after 9-11, and effective in doing so. %$* 93
i will base my arguments on the actual experience of interrogators in afghanistan and elsewhere. %$* 93
this is not a debate about torture. %$* 93
the stress methods that interrogators developed, such as short periods of sleep deprivation and isolation, were light years from torture. %$* 93
and to call them such, degrades the moral opprobrium that rightly attaches to the term. %$* 93
as my colleagues will demonstrate, the use of stress techniques on terrorists is lawful. %$* 93
the burden therefore falls on our opponents, to explain why legal and essential methods to gain critical information about future terrorist attacks should be off-limits. %$* 93
it didn’t take long for interrogators working in afghanistan, to realize that the traditional army interrogation techniques were nearly useless against the al qaeda operatives and taliban fighters whom the military was picking up in the fall of 2001.those traditional techniques, a set of 16 psychological gambits assembled during the cold war, were designed to help young americans, soldiers, debrief soviet prisoners of war on the battlefield. %$* 93
the 16 gambits have been crafted for use against conventional soldiers, lowly grunts, conscripted into a state army, who are often only too glad to be taken off the battlefield and out of the war. %$* 93
army lore held that 95 percent of lawful prisoners of war would divulge information upon direct questioning. %$* 93
in afghanistan, this ratio was reversed. %$* 93
virtually none of the terror detainees was giving up information. %$* 93
tried-and-true approaches, like appealing to a prisoner’s love of family, often had little purchase. %$* 93
if an interrogator offered a jihadist prisoner contact with his wife or children, in exchange for information, the jihadist might respond, quote, “i’ve divorced this life. %$* 93
i don’t care about my family,” end quote. %$* 93
unlike lawful prisoners of war, the terror detainees were never off the battlefield. %$* 93
they continued their vicious attacks against their captors at every opportunity while in detention. %$* 93
some of the detainees had been trained in resistance techniques, and knew the limits of american interrogation rules. %$* 93
others quickly learned what those limits were. %$* 93
so the interrogators began cautiously experimenting with stress techniques, such as marathon questioning sessions or aggressive behavior, to put a detainee on edge. %$* 93
the purpose of such methods was to recreate the shock of capture, that vulnerable mental state immediately following capture, when a prisoner is most frightened, uncertain, and likely to give up information. %$* 93
uncertainty is an interrogator’s most powerful ally. %$* 93
it can lead the detainee to believe that the interrogator is in total control, and holds the key to his future. %$* 93
an interrogator facing a resistant taliban explosives-maker, for example, might angrily hoist the prisoner up by his collar, and storm out of the interrogation booth. %$* 93
the detainee had previously understood that american interrogators couldn’t so much as lay a finger on them. %$* 93
suddenly, he doesn’t know what the interrogator’s limits are. %$* 93
that frightening uncertainty can change his calculations about whether to cooperate. %$* 93
according to interrogators in—in afghanistan and guantanamo, stress worked. %$* 93
the harsher the methods that the questioners used, the sooner they got good information. %$* 93
eventually, the military codified a set of stress techniques for use in guantanamo and iraq. %$* 93
these included keeping a detainee awake at night, putting him on cold army rations instead of hot meals, isolation, environmental manipulation, and impersonating a foreign agent. %$* 93
all were hedged round with numerous bureaucratic and medical safeguards. %$* 93
none of the stress techniques that the military approved for use on terror detainees had anything to do otherwise with abu ghraib. %$* 93
abu ghraib was the result of the unconscionable and culpable breakdown of military discipline, throughout the detention camp. %$* 93
soldiers sprayed graffiti on the walls, engaged in public sexual misbehaver, and operated bootlegging and prostitution rings. %$* 93
elliot spitzer is not known to have used any of them. %$* 93
the guards’ sadistic and sexualized treatment of prisoners was an extension of the chaos they were already wallowing in. %$* 93
it had nothing to do with interrogation. %$* 93
had the rules for prisoner treatment and questioning been followed at abu ghraib, the abuse couldn’t have happened. %$* 93
in conclusion, the stress interrogation techniques that interrogators developed to break detainees’ resistance, were necessary, effective, and lawful. %$* 93
they were far from torture. %$* 93
in certain instances as—as bob said, they resembled what army recruits and professionals go through as part of their training. %$* 93
as a reality check, here’s the senate’s definition of torture. %$* 93
it is that barbaric cruelty which lies at the top of the pyramid of human rights misconduct—such as sustained systematic beating, application of electric currents to sensitive parts of the body, and tying up or hanging in positions that cause extreme pain. %$* 93
it would be reckless to ignore the experience of interrogators on the ground, who came up against detainee resistance that was potentially catastrophic in consequence. %$* 93
intelligence about terror planning is our only sure defense against attack. %$* 93
nothing else matters. %$* 93
interrogators facing the urgent need to get life-saving information from terrorists with likely knowledge of future plots, should be allowed to use stress when the questioning techniques designed for lawful prisoners of war are not working. %$* 93
thank you. %$* 93
one. %$* 92
it would be reckless to ignore the experience of interrogators on the ground, who came up against detainee resistance that was potentially catastrophic in consequence. %$* 93
intelligence about terror planning is our only sure defense against attack. %$* 93
nothing else matters. %$* 93
interrogators facing the urgent need to get life-saving information from terrorists with likely knowledge of future plots, should be allowed to use stress when the questioning techniques designed for lawful prisoners of war are not working. %$* 93
thank you. %$* 93
against the motion, john hutson. %$* 92
thank you. %$* 94
gee, it all sounds so %$* 94
sweet and benign. %$* 94
ask ‘em a few questions, have ‘em stand up for a while, you know %$* 94
make them take their shirt off, get ‘em a little cold maybe. %$* 94
300-pound iraqi general %$* 94
stuffed in—head-first—into a sleeping bag, bound up with electrical wires, sat on by a army warrant officer %$* 94
hand put over his face every time he screamed out for allah %$* 94
released, put back in, died. %$* 94
dead. %$* 94
that was a stress position. %$* 94
guy was prosecuted, got six months for some orders violations, but, basically, was released because it was an authorized stress position. %$* 94
taxi driver dilawar, hung from the ceiling, by his wrists. %$* 94
five days after he’s—not captured, but turned over, turned over, to american forces in exchange for a ransom, beaten to a point where, according to the autopsy, by an army doctor, his legs are pulpified. %$* 94
dead. %$* 94
by the dod’s own count, approximately 40 people have been killed in the hands of the united states, in detention, as homicides. %$* 94
so let’s not kid ourselves that this is some sort of benign search for the truth. %$* 94
torture was never intended to be that. %$* 94
torture was intended originally, to be an effort to get false confessions. %$* 94
you’re a heretic, you’re a traitor to the king, you’re a witch. %$* 94
we’ve given a bad name to torture. %$* 94
we’ve misapplied torture, we’re trying to use it to find the truth, for pete’s sake. %$* 94
my experience has been, in doing these kinds of things and these—with these kinds of groups, that there are a number of people who have a number of different points of view about it. %$* 94
some of you are moved by history, tradition %$* 94
some of you are moved by the morality of it, the moral imperative. %$* 94
some of you are moved by diplomacy. %$* 94
some of you are simply moved by the practicality of it. %$* 94
are there better methods, or is this the best method. %$* 94
what i want to do is address six aspects of torture, or, benign interrogation, whatever you want to call it, stuffing people in sleeping bags head first and binding them up, and then give each of you the opportunity to pick the one that you kind of think works, and then my colleagues will hone in on some of them. %$* 94
first one is that it inflames, enrages the enemy, and causes them not to surrender. %$* 94
there’s a reason the nazis surrendered to the americans on the eastern front and not to the russians. %$* 94
in the first iraq war, tens of thousands of iraqis surrendered to us because they knew that they would be treated decently. %$* 94
my friends, they’re not surrendering to us anymore. %$* 94
it endangers our own troops. %$* 94
we’re the ones on the front lines. %$* 94
it’s the—it’s us troops at the pointy end of the spear, forward-deployed in more locations on more occasions in greater numbers than all the other forces of this world combined. %$* 94
there is a reason that the united states wanted there to be a geneva convention, it wasn’t to protect them from us, it was to protect us from them. %$* 94
and we’ve lost that. %$* 94
john mccain said, that he believes he was treated incrementally better because the vietnamese knew—north vietnam knew—that we were abiding by the geneva conventions in spite of the fact we didn’t have to. %$* 94
according to the arguments, based on the same rationale that the administration uses now. %$* 94
it interferes with our ability to build coalitions, in the future wars are gonna be fought by coalition forces. %$* 94
the united states should not and cannot go alone. %$* 94
we were just put on the list of human-rights violators by canada. %$* 94
we got them to take us off, but the point is %$* 94
canada, the aussies, the brits, aren’t going to want to fight with us if they can’t expect us to comply with the geneva conventions, and we’re going to be out there at the pointy end of the spear, all by our lone. %$* 94
it causes americans to become torturers. %$* 94
it’s one thing for us to send our good men and women into battle and ask them to give that last full measure of devotion. %$* 94
it’s another thing to send them into battle and ask them to become torturers and come home that way. %$* 94
fifthly, it’s simply not the most effective method. %$* 94
people say, “does torture work? %$* 94
” torture-, does torture work isn't the right question. %$* 94
the question is, is there another more effective way to do it. %$* 94
let me quote to you from, say, general petraeus, who one would think would know something about it. %$* 94
some may argue that we would be more effective if we sanctioned torture or other expedient methods to obtain information from the enemy. %$* 94
they would be wrong. %$* 94
beyond the basic fact that such actions are illegal, tort history shows that they are frequently neither useful nor necessary. %$* 94
the fight depends on securing the pop-, boy, that went fast. %$* 94
i just %$* 94
got into this. %$* 94
the fight depends on securing the populations, which must understand that we, not our enemies, occupy the high moral ground. %$* 94
and then finally, and i’d like to return to this, because i think it’s, if i get another chance, i think it’s the most important issue. %$* 94
this is an asymmetric war. %$* 94
in an asymmetric war you want to, you want to pit your greatest strength against the enemy’s greatest weakness. %$* 94
fortunately, in this war, that works for us, if we will do it. %$* 94
because our greatest strength is our ideas and our ideals. %$* 94
the enemy is completely bereft of ideas and our-, and ideals. %$* 94
thomas paine said in 1776, “the cause of america is the cause of all mankind.” several hundred years later, that great geopolitical commentator bono said america isn't just a country, it’s an idea. %$* 94
one. %$* 92
the fight depends on securing the pop-, boy, that went fast. %$* 94
i just %$* 94
got into this. %$* 94

thomas paine said in 1776, “the cause of america is the cause of all mankind.” several hundred years later, that great geopolitical commentator bono said america isn't just a country, it’s an idea. %$* 94
ok, thank you. %$* 92
for the motion, david rivkin. %$* 92
the critics invariably portray, as you just heard now, waterboarding and other stress techniques as torture. %$* 95
i would stipulate easily and readily that waterboarding and other stress techniques is a fairly unpleasant practice. %$* 95
it offends our 21st century sensibilities. %$* 95
it’s something that’s difficult to talk about. %$* 95
but i also believe we’re at war with an implacable and ruthless foe that thinks nothing about killing civilians by the thousands and is seeking to kill millions more. %$* 95
i don't think anybody would disagree about obtaining intelligence is vital in this war. %$* 95
and we can debate, theoretically, the proposition that other techniques work, but it’s a matter of fact. %$* 95
there are instances where hardened anti-operatives did not prove susceptible to these kinder, gentler techniques, and yet provided intelligence when they were subjected to stressful interrogation techniques. %$* 95
but my overarching message to you is that this is a policy debate. %$* 95
it should be a policy debate, which is why asking the question that has been posed today is useful. %$* 95
the obsession of legalities is not helpful. %$* 95
the legal definition of torture is necessarily vague. %$* 95
the torture defined in the ’94 statute which was passed to implement obligations under an anti-torture convention, as quote, “intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering, both physical and mental.” much of the legal debate about torture boils down to the question of how severe is severe. %$* 95
as far as the physical pain and suffering is concerned, it’s almost certainly the case that some forms of waterboarding have been practiced by the cia on only three occasions that we know of, with three different high-value detainees, rise to the level of torture. %$* 95
and some probably, particularly those that did not involve full inundation of the subject do not. %$* 95
the reason for this is because the physical discomfort suffered by the subject of-, being subjected to this technique while was not severe enough. %$* 95
as far as the mental severe pain and suffering is concerned, it bears emphasizing that congress deliberately adopted a narrow definition of the term “severe” to encompass only, and i quote, “prolonged mental harm caused by or resulting from the threat of imminent death or mind altering substances.” in my view waterboarding and other techniques practiced by the cia do not fit this definition for at least two reasons. %$* 95
first of all, the practice of waterboarding used by the cia was extremely short, sixty to ninety seconds, which certainly suggests even to our lawyer that it’s not protracted. %$* 95
significant to the question of what is, what constitutes protracted was further debated by congress in 2005 and 2006 in the context of two key pieces of legislation when congress handled-, and once again, the answer was that there has to be some duration, some timeline for something to be considered protracted. %$* 95
second, the high-value terrorist being interrogated are perfectly aware that they’re not in any danger of death, that the cia was after information, their lives were not in danger. %$* 95
when congress passed in the detainee treatment act something called “shocks the conscience standard”, which makes it even harder to argue that these techniques are always, inherently, and absolutely torture, because the shock, shocks the conscience standard, by definition-- %$* 95
and it’s something that borrows from american case law-- %$* 95
it is inherently a context- specific standard. %$* 95
it is not something that you would be able to answer in the abstract. %$* 95
it’s also worthy to point out that while the original justice department so-called “torture memo” was perhaps overly broad in its definition of what level of pain and suffering constitutes torture, lots of legal council came up with some more nuanced analysis. %$* 95
significantly, ladies and gentlemen, this analysis was developed by lawyers, at least some of whom where critical of the administration’s policy. %$* 95
indeed, as reported in the media, including by stuart taylor of the national journal, the lead author of the subsequent memo by olc on this issue was none other than senior doj official daniel levin, who himself had been subjected to waterboarding as a part of his research. %$* 95
i know that trusting the gallowman is not an argument most of you like these days, but i would certainly be inclined to trust dan levin, who by the way was reportedly forced out by alberto gonzales for not being sufficiently solicitous of the white house positions on various other issues. %$* 95
now, presented with this argument, the critics claim, “well maybe it’s not torture, but maybe it’s cruel inhuman degrading treatment”, which is another set of legal buzzwords. %$* 95
yet cruel, inhuman and degrading are even more capacious terms than torture. %$* 95
for some detainees, the mere fact that they’re being questioned by a jew or a woman is an intolerable humiliation. %$* 95
are we supposed to countenance and approve this kind of racist sentiment? %$* 95
meanwhile, it’s also the case that there has to be some reasonable definition of what is cruel, inhuman and degrading, because i would submit to you that there is a degree of humiliation, cruelty, and degradation in any kind of custodial interrogation. %$* 95
there’s yelling, there’s screaming. %$* 95
threats are being made against a person or his loved ones. %$* 95
andy fastow of enron fame was told by his interrogators that his wife would be imprisoned for a long time, and i would submit to you that it was probably a cruel treatment. %$* 95
so there has to be some parameters of behavior that’s clearly-, is cruel and degrading and humiliating, but yet does not violate the law. %$* 95
my bottom line is this: while the waterboarding debate implicates legal issue, we cannot simply abandon the field to the lawyers. %$* 95
the lawyers have no special right or expertise to deal with those issues. %$* 95
so our duty as a society is to approach these debates seriously, in a mature fashion. %$* 95
to ask what is really consistent with our values. %$* 95
incidentally, we’ve talked about mistakes. %$* 95
my good friend john mentioned mistakes. %$* 95
and yes, shoving somebody’s head in a sleeping bag is not a good thing. %$* 95
but as you may recall, these problems occur in other contexts. %$* 95
when i was at the justice department, one of my responsibilities was investigating various bad things that happened in the bureau of prisons. %$* 95
and let me assure you ladies and gentlemen, in a situation when there is no blessing for stress techniques, instead in fact-- %$* 95
prisoners in federal and civil and state penitentiaries not being interrogated at all have %$* 95
fellow prisoners who commit horrible things. %$* 95
you have sadistic guards who do horrible things. %$* 95
recently i had a case in florida %$* 95
involving mistreatment by the guards of a child in a boot camp, where he was basically smothered and suffocated in the course of trying to set him straight. %$* 95
this is not an easy debate. %$* 95
we should not focus exclusively on the question of how to deal with enemy combatants. %$* 95
we should ask a broader set of questions of what level of coercion are we prepared to tolerate in our public policy, something that our government is doing. %$* 95
we should not come up with one set of regimen for captured unlawful enemy combatants when we waterboard our own personnel. %$* 95
then there are things going on other spheres of public life, including as i mentioned, in boot camps that are harsh. %$* 95
and-- %$* 95
, but the last point is whatever we do, we should be honest and transparent about this debate. %$* 95
we should not use misdirection. %$* 95
we should not talk in terms of, “well let’s adopt the same standards as an army field manual.” because ladies and gentlemen, the army field manual, by the way, allows the level of “mutt and jeff” technique that does not allow the interrogator playing the bad cop to be disrespectful, to be tough on an individual. %$* 95
so here we have politicians advocating the level of kindness towards the unlawful enemy combatants that exceeds that that’s been adopted with regard to interrogation of criminal suspects. %$* 95
that is not %$* 95
the good way to deal with this issue. %$* 95
thank you. %$* 95
one. %$* 92
fellow prisoners who commit horrible things. %$* 95
you have sadistic guards who do horrible things. %$* 95

the good way to deal with this issue. %$* 95
thank you. %$* 95
thank you. %$* 92
against the motion, darius rejali. %$* 92
all of us on both sides want good counterterrorism policy. %$* 96
heather, david, john, all of us want to be safe. %$* 96
they just represent different fears. %$* 96
i’m here to represent the facts, not their fears. %$* 96
i have been working for 30 years on torture, on not- torture, and everything i’m about to say is in that 900-page book in the lobby. %$* 96
bottom line, good torture is not good counter-terrorism policy. %$* 96
as the fascist military police said, torture for interrogation is, and i quote, the “clumsiest method,” and only a, quote, “fool” would use it. %$* 96
and this is from their interrogation manual from burma in 1943.now i don’t care whether you call it torture, tough stuff, muffin stuff, not torture. %$* 96
the only question really is, as you say, whether it gets the bad guys, and here is where everybody gets into storytelling-- %$* 96
you’ve heard a few. %$* 96
i have one too. %$* 96
a world war ii vet came up to me after a lecture and he said, in france, we caught this german soldier and we pulled a knife to his throat and said, where are the other soldiers. %$* 96
and i said, did you get good info? %$* 96
and he said yeah, sorta. %$* 96
i said i’m happy for you, i really am. %$* 96
i really am. %$* 96
because if you had bad info, you’d be dead. %$* 96
you would be dead. %$* 96
the problem is that everyone who knows that torture or not-torture doesn’t work, is dead. %$* 96
for those for whom it works, they are walking around saying it worked for me, it worked for them, if %$* 96
this is what we call in social science a biased sample. %$* 96
if you take real data from the best studies, armies using torture who carefully and selectively selected suspects, eighty—8,000 to 20,000 minimum is what you need to get the best-case scenario, and the best-case scenario that they manage to generate out of these cases is 20 to 78 innocent people had to be tortured for each bad guy they got. %$* 96
20 to 78 innocent people for each bad guy. %$* 96
now, for every accurate piece of info then you have to torture in the thousands if you’re professional about it— this is not retail business. %$* 96
this is wholesale. %$* 96
so you tell me, does torture work? %$* 96
i’ll give you the opinion of the professional gestapo. %$* 96
in 1942 the czech resistance assassinated reinhard heydrich, reichsprotector of czechoslovakia, hitler wanted results, he didn’t care how, he said these guys don’t listen to anything, and the gestapo got the three bad guys but to do that they tortured and killed 7,545 individuals, annihilating two villages. %$* 96
they also got 100 resistance members on the side they weren’t looking for but that’s pretty typical results, battle of algiers, vietnam, we can go through them. %$* 96
at this point, enter heinz von panwitz, a career policeman and head of the gestapo’s anti-sabotage unit from prague, he said don’t be stupid. %$* 96
depend on public cooperation, build up rapport, put out a reward. %$* 96
they got over a thousand tips and in fact what broke the case, what broke the case, was when korda, a member of the czech resistance betrayed the entire operation. %$* 96
korda wasn’t tortured, he lived well, he collected a huge reward, in fact he lived long enough to be executed for treason after the war. %$* 96
the professional gestapo repeatedly decimated the resistance through public cooperation and informers, in france, denmark, poland, norway, russia, austria, czechoslovakia, even in the concentration camps. %$* 96
the gestapo turned to torture when they lost seasoned pros like panwitz during the war. %$* 96
and then they had young men with whips running around and why learn good policing when you’ve got a whip. %$* 96
huge government funded studies, our government-funded studies, have proven panwitz was right. %$* 96
if you don’t have public cooperation the chances that a crime will be solved falls to 10 percent. %$* 96
pathetic results. %$* 96
the gestapo knew public cooperation was the best anti-terrorist method. %$* 96
public cooperation works even when time is short. %$* 96
july 21st, london, seven guys get on buses with ticking bombs. %$* 96
the british police got all of these guys in 10 days, and the ticking bombs. %$* 96
the big break came in 24 hours when the parents of mukhtar said-ibrahim turned their son over after seeing the security video. %$* 96
these were loyal british muslims. %$* 96
would they have turned their son over if they knew he was gonna be—not- tortured? %$* 96
the answer is no. %$* 96
good torture isn’t just a source of bad intel, it destroys the only thing that really works, public cooperation. %$* 96
good rapport weakens even the strongest bond we know, good rapport %$* 96
restores the bond between parent and child. %$* 96
even when time is short. %$* 96
using these techniques during world war ii, the british managed to catch 290 german spies hiding among 42,000 refugees crossing over from europe without torturing any of them. %$* 96
i don’t split hairs over what torture is and what is not torture. %$* 96
if what makes torture moral or not-torture moral, if it saves innocent lives then the truth has to be that torture is immoral. %$* 96
because it takes far more innocent lives than it has ever saved, and that’s true for not-torture. %$* 96
actually, some not-torture we use is even worse than torture. %$* 96
take sleep deprivation. %$* 96
we use it all the time. %$* 96
professional spanish inquisitors, professional spanish inquisitors, wouldn’t go near it. %$* 96
they knew sleep deprivation has hypnotic effects under repeated questioning, people will generate visions. %$* 96
perfect for seeing packs of the devil and al qaeda everywhere. %$* 96
that’s why crazy scottish witch-hunters used it. %$* 96
it was very effective. %$* 96
but that’s them protestants, not—a catholic inquisitor would not go near this, quote, not-torture. %$* 96
they knew it was unreliable, and yet we use it all the time as if it gets magical results, well it is, it’s magical thinking. %$* 96
that’s all it is. %$* 96
good torture creates bad intelligence, involves torturing thousands of innocents, while the terrorists run free. %$* 96
it destroys our soldiers who are forced to put in these positions we have the studies, and the organizations. %$* 96
and limited time makes all these effects worse, not better. %$* 96
that’s the data. %$* 96
the professional gestapo knew this. %$* 96
the japanese kempei tai knew this. %$* 96
even occasionally a spanish inquisitor figured this one out. %$* 96
with great respect, why shouldn’t we not learn from them. %$* 96
good counter-terrorism policy depends on winning public support and building up human intelligence. %$* 96
look. %$* 96
i used to be on the other side. %$* 96
i grew up in iran under the shah. %$* 96
the shah’s savak tortured terrorists, and the shah said i don’t torture, we just have different ways of doing that, we have to be tough on these medieval radical throwbacks. %$* 96
they’re different. %$* 96
and khomeini said, medieval throwback, now look who’s talking, the guys who torture. %$* 96
nothing was a better recruitment tool for islamic radicalism than not-torture. %$* 96
and so the question is, how many countries in the middle east do you want to lose? %$* 96
how many witch-hunters do you want to follow. %$* 96
there is intelligence out there. %$* 96
it is time, it is really long past time for us to get our act together. %$* 96
thank you. %$* 96
oh, thank you. %$* 96
you know %$* 96
ticking time-bomb scenarios are wonderful stories, it was actually in a wonderful novel from world—from the french algerian story, it’s a wonderful fantasy novel, never happened. %$* 96
but i will tell you this. %$* 96
my book shows this. %$* 96
ticking time scenarios-- %$* 96
if you want to torture under those circumstances, do you know what the best result—when it’s gonna get you the best result? %$* 96
during peacetime non-emergency situations, when you need it least. %$* 96
it’s— %$* 96
in other words, torture doesn’t work in wartime situations when you have a ticking time bomb, you have to do—it’s a volume business at that point. %$* 96
it is not a retail business. %$* 96
look, there was a ticking time bomb in world war ii in england, right? %$* 96
those guys who got off the buses, had a ticking time bomb. %$* 96
it was sitting in the bushes in brighton, outside a jail. %$* 96
the british got it, because they had public cooperation. %$* 96
and if you want to torture, fine, but you’ll not find that bomb. %$* 96
one. %$* 92
with great respect, why shouldn’t we not learn from them. %$* 96
good counter-terrorism policy depends on winning public support and building up human intelligence. %$* 96
look. %$* 96
i used to be on the other side. %$* 96

there is intelligence out there. %$* 96
it is time, it is really long past time for us to get our act together. %$* 96
thank you. %$* 96
before we begin the discussion part of this debate, i have a question for each side. %$* 92
and darius, i’ll direct this to you. %$* 92
oh, thank you. %$* 96
no exceptions. %$* 92
we’ve all heard about the ticking-bomb scenario, a moment is precious; we need that information right away. %$* 92
if you agree that there can be exceptions, then where do you draw the line? %$* 92
you know %$* 96
ticking time-bomb scenarios are wonderful stories, it was actually in a wonderful novel from world—from the french algerian story, it’s a wonderful fantasy novel, never happened. %$* 96
but i will tell you this. %$* 96
my book shows this. %$* 96

if you want to torture under those circumstances, do you know what the best result—when it’s gonna get you the best result? %$* 96
during peacetime non-emergency situations, when you need it least. %$* 96
it’s— %$* 96
i don’t understand. %$* 92
in other words, torture doesn’t work in wartime situations when you have a ticking time bomb, you have to do—it’s a volume business at that point. %$* 96
it is not a retail business. %$* 96
i still don’t understand, if you have the ticking bomb, whether it’s wartime or not, and you know—somebody knows that there is— %$* 92
look, there was a ticking time bomb in world war ii in england, right? %$* 96
those guys who got off the buses, had a ticking time bomb. %$* 96
it was sitting in the bushes in brighton, outside a jail. %$* 96
the british got it, because they had public cooperation. %$* 96
and if you want to torture, fine, but you’ll not find that bomb. %$* 96
and now, to this side. %$* 92
david? %$* 92
yes. %$* 95
american leadership and our security, i think we can all agree are based at least in part on our alliances. %$* 92
and if america is seen as a—is seen in its interrogation methods as a renegade, as it has on such issues as say the abm treaty and the kyoto accords, won’t that endanger our leadership role, and thus our security, if we lose that moral high ground and that leadership? %$* 92
brooke, we certainly pay a high price for it but a couple of things need to be mentioned, first of all unfortunately the critics that promiscuously lump together, the kind of ordinary yelling, spittle-flying, psychological pressure, modest, sleep deprivation, and label it with the t word, are contributing to this problem. %$* 95
the notion that we as a society cannot draw nuances, cannot draw distinctions between a tough treatment, which my colleague darius here referred to as non-torture and true torture, is frankly silly because that’s not what we do in ordinary life. %$* 95
in any other difficult issues. %$* 95
but more important than that, i am not convinced, i’ve heard this argument many times, i’m not convinced, brooke, that the alleged %$* 95
price we’re paying for this aspect of our policy, is sort of a but-for problem. %$* 95
there’re so many other things, that unfortunately our friends and allies do not like because they don’t take the threat of radical islam seriously, they don’t believe in, in serious use of military power, they’re beyond that. %$* 95
but if we took that off the table it would make a difference. %$* 95
but the thing that makes me really angry is the notion that we are helping the recruitment of jihadis because we’re talking about a culture that countenances, without any problem, blowing up children, torturing american prisoners to death. %$* 95
see if you tell me %$* 95
you know, that, we’re people who are not troubled by that, they think it’s okay. %$* 95
but if they ever read about some level of sexual degradation, humiliation being inflicted on somebody by us, that really ticks them off. %$* 95
i will tell you these are the people who are not gonna win their hearts and minds no matter what we try, i find this argument absolutely absurd, and the final point about how our soldiers are treated. %$* 95
ladies and gentlemen, our soldiers have been tortured in every single war, since the end of world war ii.so the notion that somehow there’s this nirvana, tell this to john mccain. %$* 95
tell people in korea when over 50 percent of american pow’s were tortured and starved to death. %$* 95
look, we have to do the right thing because it’s the right thing. %$* 95
but let’s not pretend that it’s going to impact how our people are going to be %$* 95
dealt with. %$* 95
by this enemy. %$* 95
go ahead, rick— %$* 92
i think one of the points you were trying to make is that it will staunch the willingness of our allies to join with us in these coalitions. %$* 97
i think john, you said coalition is the way we’re gonna go in the future. %$* 97
i agree with that, but i don’t think that this aspect is going to pay that big of a role because when you look at the interrogation techniques that our allies use, they’re much tougher than we are. %$* 97
look at the way the french interrogate, look at the way the british interrogate, i— that they go far beyond our army field manual. %$* 97
i would also say, in one sense, i take john hutson’s argument as really a confirmation of what we’re arguing because he’s—you didn’t address stress, you talked about clear abuses of the interrogation rules. %$* 93
there was no license for stuffing somebody in a sleeping bag and suffocating him to death, that was a violation of the rules, not an interrogation pursuant to them— %$* 93
nobody stopped it. %$* 94
and people that have killed detainees have rightly been prosecuted. %$* 93
most of the deaths occurred at point of capture, not in interrogation at that point when you are sort of still at war, and it’s a very ambiguous state, but in any case, out of the tens of thousands of prisoners that have been taken, 40 criminal homicides is %$* 93
compared to wars in the past is a pretty low rate, but in any case, we are not arguing for torture. %$* 93
my side here is talking about stress interrogation and i would say as david does, it is perfectly valid to distinguish between keeping somebody up late that it—according to the interrogators who’ve written about this and spoken about this, reversing somebody’s sleep schedules does get information, and burning somebody or destroying them and inflicting deliberate severe pain and stress on—and suffering on them. %$* 93
we have to be able to make these distinctions. %$* 93
and, again, to conflate the murder of detainees which is clearly a violation of the laws of war, with the calibrated use of stress i think, does no service to what we need to be debating in the future in the war on terror. %$* 93
did you want to say something— %$* 92
yes, the— %$* 94
—beforehand? %$* 92
the—the point is that, in— this is not an existential war. %$* 94
world war ii was an existential, civil war was an existential war, this just happens to be the present war. %$* 94
and, for us to be here in 2008, and turn these people into supermen, that the nazis and imperial japan were not, is just kidding ourselves. %$* 94
the problem that we face now is that nobody, nobody in the administration has had said stop. %$* 94
nobody said, they may be terrorists, they may be evildoers, but they’re human beings, and we will treat them with the dignity and respect that americans have always treated human beings, instead, we just let it run rampant. %$* 94
in 1950 the armed forces officer said “wanton killing, torture, cruelty or the working of unusual, unnecessary hardships on enemy prisoners or populations is not justified under any circumstance.” we have backed away from that standard, and we have permitted good american men and women to engage in a kind of interrogation policy, not because we said, go out and torture, because we didn’t. %$* 94
i mean how—i’d like to have a nickel for every time the president’s said, the united states doesn’t torture. %$* 94
we don’t engage in extraordinary rendition. %$* 94
but the reality of it is, what was going on there, continued on. %$* 94
you know, you look at the pictures at abu ghraib, you look at—you listen to the stories of, of what happened at guantanamo, gloves off, fear down, and it was pretty clear that if it wasn’t the express policy it was the benign policy of the united states to engage in techniques that we had absolutely forbidden. %$* 94
in 1903 we sent an american major to prison for 10 years for waterboarding a filipino. %$* 94
we prosecuted japanese for waterboarding, and sent them to prison. %$* 94
john, to say it’s—we’ve let it run rampant is just not true, people that have abused prisoners have been prosecuted criminally. %$* 93
when abu ghraib came out— %$* 93
some, some have been— %$* 98
—there has been— %$* 93
—some have been prosecuted— %$* 98
there has been investigation after investigation of that. %$* 93
i would agree, i think abu ghraib, there has not been sufficient, responsibility laid on the commanders that let that situation get out of control, i think it needs to go way far up the pentagon chain of command but it hasn’t, but again, that happened in contravention of the interrogation rules, the interrogation rules, if they had been followed to the letter, they said that every interrogation technique had to be cleared, had to be monitored. %$* 93
what was going on was not interrogation, this was a bunch of deranged, sadistic guards, working in the middle of the night, that were getting their jollies on these prisoners, it had nothing to do with the interrogation rules— %$* 93
let, let me— %$* 97
rick? %$* 92
you— %$* 97
rick? %$* 92
well—and i think we need to but this abu ghraib thing to rest, and you’re absolutely right, this was not the interrogations we’re talking about. %$* 97
this was a bunch of military policemen running amok, it was a breakdown of—where were their officers, where were the nco’s, it was a complete breakdown of the chain of command— %$* 97
that is— %$* 92
it was set up by the, by the command in baghdad and there have been careers ruined for this, general sanchez is out of the army now. %$* 97
and he’s—he set up an unworkable chain of command, he put the intelligence people in charge of the prison. %$* 97
you don’t do that— %$* 97
but some of the jollies that have been described here were techniques that were actually used in vietnam. %$* 92
somebody told them what to do, it wasn’t a simple improvisation— %$* 92
—we’re having this debate and the public should, i think, understand this. %$* 98
we’re having this debate as if, and i think heather articulated this point, tried to make this point, that everybody that came in on the battlefield in afghanistan, whether they be taliban or a so-called arab insurgent, really had a lot of information. %$* 98
her position is that people were not cooperating. %$* 98
they were not cooperating, and because they had been trained. %$* 98
when the fact of the matter is they weren’t trained. %$* 98
the fact of the matter was the reason why they weren’t cooperating, was because they didn’t know anything. %$* 98
by and large, you have to separate the taliban from the arab al qaeda fighter. %$* 98
they’re two distinct groups. %$* 98
in point of fact, they don’t get along quite well. %$* 98
so if somebody is not cooperating, it doesn’t mean that they have been trained. %$* 98
the fact of the matter is that a lot of our people on the ground in bagram, and i’m quite familiar with it, on the military side, had no idea what they were doing. %$* 98
i need— %$* 92
had not received any training whatsoever. %$* 98

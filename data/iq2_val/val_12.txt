most of the people that are proposed to spend the money, whether it be the un or the us government or anybody’s government, i think they’re gonna spend it badly. %$* 104
how about we set incentives to enable the business community to do what it is already doing, which is decarbonizing, because it’s in their economic interest— %$* 104
but—but, hunter, i love the loucheness of saying, oh, this is gonna be free, we are gonna make money off of this. %$* 99
i love the fact that you want to reintroduce into the american public the idea of a profit-maximizing ceo.i think that’s a good idea. %$* 99
but honestly, i think you already have that. %$* 99
the point is, how are we gonna get beyond that, and that is gonna be costly and europe has shown the way. %$* 99
it’s not costly— %$* 99
but, bjorn, costly, i mean the question went to the matter of a 2 percent of— %$* 13
yeah— %$* 99
—gnp, that is enormously costly. %$* 13
yeah, and that is what the un is telling us that the cost is in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) probably gonna be. %$* 99
i mean, you have a discussion about is it gonna be 1, is it gonna be 3 percent, but it’s definitely gonna be hugely costly, and simply making these stories that some companies can make money, hey, great. %$* 99
and presumably we don’t have to do anything to make them make money. %$* 99
but—bjorn— %$* 100
but the real question is— %$* 99
please— %$* 100
—where are we gonna get the rest of the cuts— %$* 99
one of the absolute key things here is actually to address the very agenda that you’ve put forward of huge spending into research and development— %$* 100
yep— %$* 99
—for renewable technology, and the strange things is that you put that forward as if it were some kind of an alternative to cutting carbon but in fact it’s a very important aspect of how you set about cutting carbon emissions. %$* 100
where you’re wrong with in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) that, it is a necessary part but not sufficient because there are two components, there’s research-and-development, and then there is making sure that it happens on a sufficiently large scale to get the economies of mass production, which are real, and we know in the case of solar pv, that the cost falls 20 percent, for every doubling of production, we see in the new york times today, that the cost to americans of installing solar pv is half of what it used to be, as a result in part of these kind of cost savings— %$* 100
oliver, we’re not disagreeing with you on that— %$* 103
we need—this is the situation that we need to bring about, and as the costs come down, through research, through development, through mass production, through large-scale deployment, we are bringing— %$* 100
but oliver— %$* 103
nobody on this panel, nobody on this panel is against increasing energy efficiency and energy security, it’s the most sensible thing of all. %$* 103
but if you’re making the marker of it, always what is in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) precisely happening to carbon, a, you’re not gonna do it, and i’m sorry to say you’re not actually going to do it for a reason i’ll just mention in a second, but also, you’re—the real issue is how are we going to have enough energy of all types, not just to keep the us going, but above all from my point of view, for the developing world. %$* 103
that is to me absolutely crucial— %$* 103
absolutely— %$* 100
but let’s talk about the developing world and how you— %$* 104
yeah, but %$* 101
—how you meet their energy needs. %$* 104
frankly they— %$* 104
how they meet energy needs— %$* 101
with energy— %$* 103
the developing world—the developing world— %$* 104
peter huber, let’s hear from peter huber, please— %$* 13
in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) we know how they’re meeting their energy needs, they are taking down the rainforest, they are soaking carbon out of their land, and they are burning coal, i mean we actually know this—you know, all this talk about externalities— if you don’t know this, the kyoto system divides the world. %$* 101
i didn’t do this, they did it, they divide it into 20-80, okay? %$* 101
everything on the 20, nothing on the 80. how can we even talk about externalities—if we said to you, folks, we’re getting an externality system worked out for this group just right here, but it’s only this group here, all the rest of you do what you like, what do you think would work with that system, nothing would work. %$* 101
interesting and totally off the point of are major cuts in carbon worth the money. %$* 104
take afghanistan where i work. %$* 104
you and i and the rest of american taxpayers this winter will spend something like $80 million, buying diesel to run the north kabul power planet, that diesel trucked over the khyber pass, fat target. %$* 104
if instead, we enabled the afghans by training, by technology transfer, to grow oil crops, like getropha, or sunflowers, or nut crops, take the oil and make it into biodeisel, they would have a viable industry, they would have jobs, and we would not be paying for the diesel— %$* 104
right. %$* 101
in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) %$* 101
—to pollute the air in kabul. %$* 104
now yes, this would be an expenditure of money. %$* 104
it would enhance national security for us, and if in fact we don’t deliver genuine development to the afghans, we will get our heads handed to us— %$* 104
but hunter, what about the impact of biofuel development for this, on the need, even greater need to increase world food supply. %$* 103
you’re taking land now increasingly for biofuels to increase world food supply, it is a competitive choice— %$* 103
only because you’re doing it stupidly and because— %$* 104
no— %$* 103
—we are subsidizing it. %$* 104
no. %$* 103
no— %$* 103
yeah. %$* 104
we are— %$* 104
you are subsidizing it, but, in fact the seriousness all the way through from malaysia for example to indonesia et cetera, the impact is potential, in fact some people argue, it is now one of the in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) most serious pressures causing in fact reduction in world food supply. %$* 103
but i’m not trying to defend— %$* 104
—at a time, when we have to— %$* 103
bjorn—bjorn lomborg, let’s have— %$* 13
well— %$* 99
—bjorn— %$* 13
—i just want us to bring us back to having a conversation and hunter was actually very good at that. %$* 99
we need to get back to business, this is not about who can come up with the smartest story or the most endearing cute little tale. %$* 99
this is about how can we do this in the world. %$* 99
and the economists have done those studies, and they have shown that this has real and significant costs, on the of, you know, 1 to 3 or 4 percent of gdp. %$* 99
but i think you miss the difference— in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) %$* 102
the question is— %$* 99
—between a cost and an investment— %$* 102
—do you want to spend that much money— well, but the problem is, it’s not an investment if it doesn’t actually pay back more and that’s of course the whole question. %$* 99
are we doing a lot of good for the world— %$* 99
adam werbach, against the motion— %$* 13
i love the fact that we’re being— %$* 99
—speaking against the motion. %$* 13
i enjoy the conversation, i mean two, three years ago we were arguing about whether climate change was real. %$* 102
and now we’ve moved beyond that, now the question is should there be a carbon cap, that seems to be or should it just be investments in things that actually bring down the cost of energy for everyone. %$* 102
okay, well i agree that we should be investing and bringing down the cost for everyone. %$* 102
now, then the debate is, are major reductions in carbon necessary, do we actually need a cap in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) as well. %$* 102
well for the companies i work with and for governments, they actually want the rules set. %$* 102
we know what happens when the rules aren’t set. %$* 102
but what’s happening when the rules are not set is we see companies %$* 102
and like, we’ve just seen in wall street. %$* 102
but adam— %$* 101
—we’ve seen, without an effective sec, with an effective regulatory framework, people can invest and there’s no guarantee for the investment— %$* 102
but—but adam, your side itself is proposing no cap on 80 percent of the world that currently generates fifty— %$* 101
but—no, i am saying— %$* 102
—54 percent— %$* 101
wait—we are not proposing that— %$* 100
54 percent of, of the— %$* 101
this is in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) %$* 102
—the greenhouse gases. %$* 101
this is the old kyoto system and i don’t think any of us is supporting that. %$* 100
john, could we just answer the word “major,” which seemed to be the really— %$* 103
yes, i was gonna come right to that— %$* 13
—serious question that the lady here asked. %$* 103
if i’m being quite honest about major, to influence climate in any way, you fundamentally would have to throw 4 billion people out of work. %$* 103
you’d have to keep every ounce of coal in the ground, every ounce of oil in the ground, and let’s be absolutely frank, it isn’t going to happen. %$* 103
because, the impact of anything less from changing your light bulbs to biofuels, is absolutely nonexistent on climate, and that’s my point. %$* 103
if it were truly worth doing, the costs would be right. %$* 103
but it won’t work on climate. %$* 103
now, philip, i would really like to take you up on the point here because i think that what we’re seeing here, when in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) we began, the introduction that was given was that your side accepted the fundamental reality of climate change caused by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere but all you’ve done is to deny it. %$* 100
no— %$* 103
panel, there—there has been a tendency to, i think almost accuse the other side of intellectual dishonesty. %$* 13
philip, you used the term “junk science.” adam— %$* 13
i didn’t— %$* 103
—you, you accused— %$* 13
no, no, no, i didn’t— %$* 103
—peter huber of contempt. %$* 13
bjorn, you accused oliver tickell of doom-mongering— %$* 13
that’s what i’ve been doing— %$* 102
do, do, do— do you in fact— adam, do you think in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) your other side, your opponents’ arguments are intellectually dishonest? %$* 13
well, that’s for them to decided in their consciences tonight. %$* 102
but, um— %$* 102
no, no, actually— %$* 13
but i do—but the ques— %$* 102
—it’s a question to you. %$* 13
but the question i guess—i accused my opponent of contempt. %$* 102
and when someone says 5 billion poor people are the problem, and that’s—that was a direct quote from what he said, that is a contemptuous statement. %$* 102
“our jobs sent to their shores.” that is a contemptuous statement. %$* 102
i don’t—i think that is a fact. %$* 102
well, if anybody took— %$* 101
peter huber— %$* 13
—a discussion of jobs as contempt, i truly apologize, i feel no in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) contempt, i’m trying to talk about macro-economic effects in a global economy, you know, many people feel there is a global economy and things do move like that. %$* 101
as for saying, you know, their fecundity has beaten our gluttony, i don’t know which is ruder, to be, you know, gross and eat too much, or to have lots of children but i don’t mean any contempt by it, i’m just saying it is an actual fact. %$* 101
philip stott— %$* 13
it really is the truth— %$* 101
philip stott speaking for the motion— %$* 13
yeah, john, one of the great things about the rosenkranz foundation debates is precisely that they assume that each side respects the position of the other, and one of the great things about this debate is that i’m hearing all these arguments, i actually am happy to respect the position, and in fact one of the terrible things that has happened recently, is the attempt to close down debate, and in fact to attack people, with the use of extremely un—not my colleagues here, extremely unpleasant language. %$* 103
it is absolutely that debate is vital on a topic like this, it’s vigorous of course, hunter and i are gonna go in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) at each other. %$* 103
but i respect her position absolutely, and not one of us denies the influence of humans on climate change— %$* 103
but, philip, you yourself spoke earlier of “this global warming non”—“this global warming”— %$* 100
global warming costs— %$* 103
“this global warming nonsense”— %$* 100
cost nonsense, very different— %$* 103
“this global warming nonsense,” i wrote it down, you spoke of co2— %$* 100
no, global warming costs— %$* 103
—as a single variable on the market— %$* 100
yes, absolutely. %$* 103
bjorn lomborg said major carbon cuts will do little to change the temperature and nothing to save the world, this is in fact a denialism— in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) %$* 100
no— %$* 103
—of the realities— %$* 100
ab— you see, that is what i absolutely— %$* 103
you are— %$* 100
—am unhappy with. %$* 103
no, no, you’re— %$* 100
you are telling me i’m denying it— %$* 103
boys, boys— %$* 104
i’m not— %$* 103
—you’re not debating the topic. %$* 104
no, i agree— %$* 102
you’re not debating the topic— in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) %$* 104
i agree, i agree— %$* 102
i’m gonna go for some more questions— %$* 13
which are— %$* 104
—because i—we’re in a little bit of a circular loop on this one— %$* 13
yeah, i agree. %$* 102
an impasse, i would say. %$* 13
right in the middle, you might need to %$* 13
would you be comfortable in walking out, thanks. %$* 13
that’s wise, the microphone’s coming in to you. %$* 13
there it is. %$* 13
i just wanted to sort of start by saying that we seem to have come round, sort of %$* 10
intellectual dishonesty and it’s all about economics versus science and so i wanna start out with just saying, i’m an economist and i have a question. %$* 10
whether this is still about sort of economics or not, and i wanna sort of direct this question to bjorn lomborg. %$* 10
mm-hmm. %$* 99
in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) %$* 99
you stated that the copenhagen consensus favored technology, r-and-d investment. %$* 10
however, isn’t it true that the economists that you are so eagerly quoting as the great work that they’ve done, have basically publicly distanced themselves from your interpretation of their work, and i’m talking about richard tol and gary yohe. %$* 10
so basically, they say that they actually never looked at that, they looked at a climate-mix policy, which would have adaptation, mitigation, and r-and-d technology, which is the point that oliver tickell made. %$* 10
thank you— %$* 10
bjorn, i’m not gonna leave that hanging out there, go right to it. %$* 13
sure. %$* 99
you’ve unfortunately read half of the discussion because it’s true, that they first made a comment in, in the guardian and then later on, after we’d had a long discussion on a blog, we actually, yohe and i wrote a joint column, where we pointed out what it was we said. %$* 99
yes, yohe, and to a certain extent tol, believe that it’s also a good idea that we invest, and remember, it is mainly investing in research and development but also investing in carbon reductions right now. %$* 99
there was another party, professor green, who made the argument that we should be investing much more in research and development and then only much later invest in cutting carbon emissions. %$* 99
what came in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) out of the copenhagen consensus where we had eight of the world’s top economists, including five nobel laureates, looking at all that stuff, they said, well, if you look just in carbon reductions which is what we talk about here tonight, that probably pays less than $1 back on the dollar. %$* 99
whereas if we invest in research and development, it probably does $11 worth of good for every dollar. %$* 99
and that’s the main reason— %$* 99
but bjorn, this is a completely false choice— %$* 100
—why we’re making this point— %$* 99
—this is another one of your false choices, we—there is no choice here, we absolutely need— %$* 100
no, no, that’s, and that— %$* 99
—to invest in r-and-d in order to achieve these cuts in greenhouse emissions— %$* 100
and this is the brilliant, and very, very good demonstration, that oliver tickell can’t see anything that we shouldn’t be spending money on and say let’s spend money on it. %$* 99
i would suggest that we should spend money— in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) %$* 99
i’m agreeing with you, bjorn, we need to spend that— %$* 100
—on things that give us $11 of good in the world, but we don’t spend a dollar for every time we just get 90 cents back on— %$* 99
in the new yorker last week— %$* 103
philip stott. %$* 13
in the new yorker last week, your own magazine, a very liberal magazine and one i love, very interestingly, there was a fascinating statement, which that, you can’t effectively do dual or multi-instruments politically, to answer say both poverty and climate change, and the—i love the analogy that was given by the professor quoted, it was a very good one. %$* 103
i might wish to save energy and i’ve invited you all round for dinner, be very nice to meet you all for dinner, but in fact, i’m going to cook my pizzas and all the rest of it, in the shower so i’m going to save energy. %$* 103
of course you’re going to end up with a very, very rotten dinner, and i think this is at the heart of what we’re discussing here, how far do— how far do dual instruments and multi-instruments actually work, and i think, it’s when i do passionately disagree with oliver on this. %$* 103
because, let’s be in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) honest, in our own households and everything, we have a given income, we have to make very, very difficult choices. %$* 103
if i know what i would put my choices by the way, very simply, and they would tie in, not because i’m supporting bjorn particularly on this because they—i came to this decision a long— i am very worried indeed about the whole state of the development of new viruses in the world at the moment, they are all very serious problems. %$* 103
and if you look historically, the single biggest effects that have created deaths amongst humanity, have been the evolution of new viruses, new bacteria, and new forms. %$* 103
and that’s the crucial point. %$* 103
across the— %$* 103
adam werbach, are you— %$* 13
objection, your honor, irrelevant. %$* 104
yes— %$* 13
no. %$* 103
no, it’s— %$* 103
dr. %$* 13
lovins, take it— %$* 13
it’s not irrelevant, not irrelevant— in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) %$* 103
let me go to what you invest and what you get. %$* 104
little company across the river, ferrara construction, put solar panels on the top of its building. %$* 104
it now has a net-zero building. %$* 104
which means that it is sending back to the grid more energy than it is using. %$* 104
they are selling the energy for about $1.11 per square foot, as opposed to paying two bucks 30 a square foot, which they had previously been doing, to buy their electricity from the grid. %$* 104
now, spread this across the country, southern california edison, recently built a 250-megawatt power plants on roofs, spread around the county, at a price point of $875 million. %$* 104
a coal plant was recently canceled in montana at a price point of about $800 million. %$* 104
very close— %$* 104
but hunter, hunter, the— %$* 99
we are very near what’s called, grid parity, where the solar technologies are actually cheaper— %$* 104
but hunter— %$* 99
—than generating electricity through coal— %$* 104
bjorn, take this but take it briefly— in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) %$* 13
—which is why i don’t believe the numbers that china is going to build all these coal plants. %$* 104
you know who the world’s first green billionaire is? %$* 104
he’s a chinese solar entrepreneur. %$* 104
they have just announced that they’re going to increase— %$* 103
yeah— %$* 99
—they’ve just announced— %$* 103
bjorn—philip— %$* 13
—their official spokesman— %$* 103
—i wanna give bjorn a chance ‘cause you— %$* 13
yes— %$* 103
—had a—quite a chance so far— %$* 13
yeah i have, but just, it’s crucial this, that china has just announced a 30 percent increase. %$* 103
they’ve just announced it. %$* 103
in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) %$* 103
okay. %$* 13
hmm. %$* 99
bjorn— %$* 13
and has just announced— %$* 100
—let me—i want bjorn to speak and then i wanna go to questions— %$* 13
yes— %$* 99
—the gentleman up there, you can be ready— %$* 13
and the bottom line is, if hunter is right, and everybody makes money off of this, cool, we can all go home, we don’t need to worry about it because it’ll happen. %$* 99
absolutely— %$* 103
but the real question is— in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) %$* 99
no it won’t because— %$* 104
—we know— %$* 99
—we invest— %$* 104
no, no, hunter, please let me— %$* 99
—240 million dollar—billion dollars a year in subsidies, to the conventional technologies. %$* 104
right. %$* 99
and that’s what’s getting in the way of unleashing this new energy economy. %$* 104
no. %$* 99
the real point here is to say, are we gonna go further than that, and we know, and this is of course also what you accept, we know that the emissions scenarios expect dramatic increases in co2, and what you’re saying is, over and above all these great inventions that you describe and everybody else has been talking on the other side of the panel, over and above that, we have to cut dramatically. %$* 99
that’s what costs money. %$* 99
that’s the in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) discussion that we’re having money. %$* 99
gentleman in the middle of the hall, please— %$* 13
honestly, the real question is, is that worth it— %$* 99
yes, come on out— %$* 13
and my question is still, are we spending trillions of dollars to do virtually no good a hundred years from now, i’m sorry, oliver, that’s not actually— %$* 99
we’re going to a question now with this gentleman— %$* 13
—misrepresenting science. %$* 99
please. %$* 13
you know, it’s clear that is a global problem, everybody agrees on that. %$* 9
but impacts and return on investment do matter. %$* 9
so in the face of 3 to 4 percent gdp, i’d like to ask the folks who are arguing against the motion. %$* 9
what in a legal context, or an enforceability stand—from an enforceability standpoint, would you expect that we can actually do about china, india and the in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) developing world. %$* 9
adam werbach. %$* 13
well the first— the first false choice that is placed here, is deciding that china needs to be constrained first, i mean, the greatest challenge and i—mr. %$* 102
lomborg and i would agree here, the greatest challenge that’s facing the people of china is that too many of them don’t have enough energy. %$* 102
they need a lot more of it. %$* 102
and we have a moral, a just cause, to make sure that everyone can live on the planet and there’ll be 9 billion of us by 2040, with enough energy to be able to live. %$* 102
so, i actually far expect our carbon emissions to increase—recession-depression notwithstanding, right now, as we try to get those people to energy parity, they live in energy deficit. %$* 102
and our first priority, one of the reasons i believe so much in investing right now, is because we need to create technologies that can make the case. %$* 102
now, what type of constraints would be put on china, well china obviously is interested in that as well. %$* 102
and china as it begins to invest and succeed as hunter mentioned in one of their entrepreneurs, in building these sort of renewable technologies, is gonna be very interested in dealing with the air pollution because in chinese cities they’re very concerned about air pollution right now and they know that comes from coal plants in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) and they’re concerned about dealing with that. %$* 102
so they’re highly motivated to, to reach the point of energy parity, a place where everyone has enough energy, and then to ratchet down both the co2 emissions, the air particulate matter emissions, and all those sorts of negative consequences that come from it. %$* 102
peter huber, do you— %$* 13
you know, there is no field of policy you will ever find and i spent 25 years in washington watching this, where you will find a greater gap between what people actually do, and what they say they’re gonna do, wanna do, should do, oughta do. %$* 101
the eu itself, the people who are most frantic about this and who signed this stuff, they’re not—none of them or possibly one of them will meet their kyoto commitments. %$* 101
they issued tradable permits, and promptly depressed the value to virtually zero because they issued so many, they were all worried about job-export issues. %$* 101
i mean, you know, you just cannot talk about what people are gonna do for anything. %$* 101
china is, in fact, building coal plants like crazy. %$* 101
okay? %$* 101
they say they’re gonna build more but i couldn’t care less what they say. %$* 101
they are actually doing it. %$* 101
they are the world’s biggest emitter today. %$* 101
how can you ignore the world’s biggest emitter? %$* 101
in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) %$* 101
well, but i mean, there’s a few things %$* 100
i’ll let you go. %$* 13
and surely one key thing is that a very large part of this coal that’s being burnt in china is actually producing products for export to america and to the european countries. %$* 100
and so you’ll tax our plants but not theirs, right? %$* 101
and it’s important to recognize that. %$* 100
another thing, let’s look at what china is actually doing. %$* 100
china is investing hugely in renewables. %$* 100
china has already got the world’s biggest solar tank industries. %$* 100
china is investing hugely in wind turbines. %$* 100
they are building more and more of the world’s turbines and bringing the cost of turbines down. %$* 100
and yes, they may indeed be mining more coal but much of that is surely displacing imports-- %$* 100
and from indonesia and australia. %$* 100
philip stott, philip stott. %$* 13
well, i don't want to talk about – let me just mention briefly in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) europe. %$* 103
an absolute failure under the kyoto protocol. %$* 103
talks a lot, have not %$* 103
we’re not debating kyoto. %$* 104
no. %$* 103
what we’re debating is the effectiveness of major cost. %$* 103
europe – %$* 103
has failed utterly, for economic and political reasons, to cut. %$* 103
some of the figures-- %$* 103
from spain, from italy, from ireland-- %$* 103
are just mind blowing. %$* 103
and this is what i just, we’re in a cloud, cuckoo land here. %$* 103
and let me just make a point about this. %$* 103
we’re worried about china, yet worry about the e.u.now on this. %$* 103
half the e.u.now is opposing the e.u.’s policy on cutting carbon. %$* 103
listen to the czech president, for example. %$* 103
that’s vaclav klaus, who is the current president of the e.u. why do you think the recent e.u. policies have collapsed virtually? %$* 103
don’t think europe, don’t think it’s just china or india. %$* 103
don’t take the, what europe says. %$* 103
europe talks but it’s not walking the walk. %$* 103
so under in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) %$* 32
hunter, hunter lovins, please. %$* 13
hunter lovins against the motion. %$* 13
you know what’s gonna get china to cut its carbon emissions? %$* 104
it’s not gonna be you and me and it’s not gonna be the government. %$* 104
it’s gonna be wal-mart, which recently said to its chinese suppliers, you will report your carbon footprint through a little group called the carbon disclosure project. %$* 104
who are they? %$* 104
it’s a little group, a little non-profit out of the u.k. that a few years back sent out a survey to the financial times 500-- %$* 104
the five hundred biggest companies on earth – saying, what’s your carbon footprint? %$* 104
and for a couple of years everybody ignored it, until three years ago, when sixty percent of the world’s largest companies answered the survey. %$* 104
last year it was seventy- seven percent. %$* 104
why? %$* 104
they represent institutional investors with over forty-one trillion dollars in assets. %$* 104
you’re gonna go to the capital marketplace, you better answer their survey. %$* 104
and under sarbanes-oxley, the new u.s.corporate ethics law, if as a manager you fail to disclose to shareholders information that can materially affect the value of stock, you can be personally criminally liable. %$* 104
what’s your carbon footprint? %$* 104
watch china’s emissions start to come down – in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) %$* 104
simply because that’s the way the best companies are doing business now. %$* 104
well, i love the way you think that wal-mart is actually gonna go and say, oh, they produce a lot of carbon. %$* 99
let’s call-- %$* 99
let’s buy stuff that costs a lot more from someone who don’t produce as much carbon. %$* 99
obviously, wal-mart can do that but i don’t think they’ll stay in business. %$* 99
let me also just point out two things. %$* 99
i thought it was very rare to see that adam was actually – i’m not sure to what extent it was conscious, but he was actually agreeing with us, which is really nice. %$* 99
you should come over here. %$* 99
he was basically saying, china is going to go and emit much, much more. %$* 99
then they’re gonna be careful and they care a lot about air pollution. %$* 99
and that’s absolutely true. %$* 99
then he sort of slipped in, and they’re gonna cut carbon emissions. %$* 99
uh, no, of course not. %$* 99
they’re gonna put scrubbers on their coal plants, which is really smart. %$* 99
but they’re not gonna care about their carbon emissions for a long term. %$* 99
and i would just like, the last point also – do you remember how hunter told in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) us about the first chinese billionaire is a guy who produces solar panels? %$* 99
do you know who he sells those solar panels to? %$* 99
he sells them to germany. %$* 99
they’ve actually bought a hundred and fifty-six billion dollars worth of solar panels. %$* 99
do you know how much good that’s gonna do? %$* 99
by the end of this century that will postpone global warming by one hour. %$* 99
no, this is complete rubbish. %$* 100
i’m simply asking you, is that the way we want to help the world? %$* 99
this is complete rubbish. %$* 100
i’m going to go a question here %$* 13
this is complete rubbish because germany has been doing the most enormous favor to the world by buying these panels, by – %$* 100
no. %$* 99
getting them into mass production and by in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) %$* 100
let him finish. %$* 13
for everybody. %$* 100
question from the rear, please. %$* 13
germany has the biggest brown coal plants in the world. %$* 103
philip. %$* 13
they’re the single most polluting coal plants. %$* 103
philip, i want to move on. %$* 13
question from the rear, please. %$* 13
to my ear those against the motion are not being, are not confronting the choices that are necessary. %$* 9
and, uh, and it’s been sort of a flagrantly anecdotal presentation. %$* 9
and i would in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) suppose that, first of all, i want to say that, um, hunter, hunter actually said, whether she realizes it or not, during her presentation, the initial presentation, that there were, it, that the, what they have in mind would require neither major chances in taxation or major changes in regulation. %$* 9
now, if, if that’s it then why are we having the debate and let’s go on. %$* 9
is that your question? %$* 13
i don’t think that’s – my question is, for anyone on that side, to honestly address the real tradeoffs that we’re talking about, if we’re talking about one or two or three percent of gross, gross international product or whatever the other major changes are. %$* 9
if there aren’t major tradeoffs then we shouldn’t be having the debate and i think they’ve been denying the tradeoffs all throughout the debate. %$* 9
oliver tickell, please. %$* 13
all you folks are agreed that there are tradeoffs and that there are some aspects of moving to a low carbon economy which actually produce a net gain. %$* 100
your negative costs are low hanging fruit, but there are other areas where there are real costs – at least in the short term. %$* 100
the important thing is that as you in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) progress from the short term through to the medium term you find that the investments that you’re making in renewable energy technology, for example, and in mass production, developing the engineering expertise to bring costs down-- %$* 100
that actually over the medium term, these shift from being a cost to being a benefit. %$* 100
and the nature of that benefit is a lot more than just the carbon. %$* 100
there are many, many benefits, such as air pollution. %$* 100
what is the world’s biggest source of arsenic and mercury in the environment? %$* 100
it is burning coal. %$* 100
what do you say to all, to the absolutely disgusting images that we see of mountaintop removal in appalachia in order to reach coal seams? %$* 100
what do you think of the wars that are being waged in the middle east where the thirst for fossil fuels and oil fundamentally underlies them? %$* 100
there are many benefits in moving away from that kind of world into a world which is actually characterized by cooperation on energy because if we move large scale to renewable energy it requires cooperation among countries with different kinds of intermittent renewables balancing out supplies over long distance grids. %$* 100
and that will actually fundamentally change the whole way in which countries interact with each other. %$* 100
it’ll produce not just a greener world, a cleaner world, but actually a safer world and a happier world. %$* 100
and these are values surely worth aspiring to. %$* 100
in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) %$* 100
bjorn lomborg. %$* 13
since i was – %$* 104
the basic problem – sorry. %$* 99
since i was directly attacked, can i have a bite at that one? %$* 104
yes, because – %$* 13
thank you. %$* 104
you were directly attacked. %$* 13
and then bjorn. %$* 13
and i’d like, in the meantime, to move the camera to the side because i’m going to take a question from the woman in the blue sweater. %$* 13
other tradeoffs – not if we do it intelligently. %$* 104
markets work. %$* 104
let’s use them. %$* 104
study after study after study after study has shown that we can meet the needs of a world population of nine billion, meet the energy needs with efficiency and renewables. %$* 104
the paley commission of the u.s.government in the 1950s then urged an immediate in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) transition to energy efficiency in renewables as a matter of urgent national security. %$* 104
had we done it then we would not be having this debate now because we would not be burning carbon. %$* 104
can, how do we do it? %$* 104
yeah, that definitely takes some exquisite economics, planning. %$* 104
i’m not a big fan of kyoto and i am on record betting the danish energy minister a bottle of whiskey that cop 15 will fail, that the effort by the world to come up with a where-do-we-go-from-kyoto? %$* 104
will fail. %$* 104
and then i think we’ll have the real debate, which is, how do we use the enormous power of markets to unleash innovation around the world to enable the poor people to meet their own energy needs with their own resources, their own intelligence and to enable us to have the prosperity that, again, study after study after study has shown that we can have, if we invest now in the smartest technologies. %$* 104
bjorn lomborg. %$* 13
let’s go. %$* 104
bjorn lomborg. %$* 13
i find it a little bizarre to refer to a study in the 1950s that show that we could actually have done this cheaply but we in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) just failed to do so. %$* 99
maybe that’s because it’s very, very hard and actually very costly. %$* 99
and that is, unfortunately-- %$* 99
i’m sorry, hunter – what all the global cost benefit in. %$* 99
analyses show. %$* 99
but let me just point out to oliver – because he very eloquently put how we should invest in all this and this is a great deal. %$* 99
notice what germany has done. %$* 99
it’s spent a hundred and fifty-six billion dollars on buying very inefficient solar technology. %$* 99
the thing i don’t understand is why didn’t they just invest one/tenth of that in actually making solar panels much better? %$* 99
that would have really made a difference and that would have made it easier for the chinese and everybody else to get solar panels cheaper, faster. %$* 99
and the other thing i want to point out is just, it’s terrible – %$* 99
let, let me just finish. %$* 99
in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) %$* 100
the other thing is that it’s terrible to say this is gonna help-- %$* 99
bjorn, bjorn and oliver – when you’re speaking simultaneously no one can hear you. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 99
you had a shot at it. %$* 13
let oliver respond. %$* 13
yeah, bjorn, you just asked me a question and i have an answer, which is that that’s what private investors are doing. %$* 100
this is what the solar power companies are doing because they see here is the demand from germany. %$* 100
and therefore, they are investing. %$* 100
this is private investment. %$* 100
this is companies – %$* 100
no, the – and – %$* 99
that are investing because they see a market. %$* 100
and that is why the new york times reported today that the cost of solar panels is falling dramatically. %$* 100
no, no. %$* 99
the international energy agency has actually shown that the investment in renewables have gone in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) down, not up, globally. %$* 99
and i’m sorry, that’s because we are so focused on cutting carbon emissions that everybody worries about how we can get through the next five years, not how we’re gonna get through the next fifty %$* 99
investment in everything has collapsed. %$* 100
it’s called the credit crunch, bjorn. %$* 100
oliver, please. %$* 13
question from the front left. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 10
made the point that he’s in favor of research and development for low carbon technologies. %$* 10
and you’ve just made a couple of, of comparisons of tradeoffs between what might be worth it and what else might not be worth it. %$* 10
so it seems to me that we’re not necessarily debating whether reducing carbon is worth is but really how much it’s worth. %$* 10
so my question for the whole, for your panel is, where do you draw the line between major reductions that for you are not worth it and what is worth it? %$* 10
peter huber. %$* 13
well, let me start by saying this: there is a very big difference between saying we ought to keep studying something and saying in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) we ought to put in place forcible mechanisms today that will force people to adopt technology today. %$* 101
all right? %$* 101
because, you know, you can talk all you like about solar. %$* 101
the price point you’ve gotta beat is three cent coal. %$* 101
if you don’t beat three cent coal you’re not there. %$* 101
it is of no interest that you can beat, it’s of no interest that you can beat fourteen cent gas, okay? %$* 101
, or, it’s – %$* 101
excuse me, peter, the coal industry itself says that new coal plants will cost thirteen or fifteen cents. %$* 104
well, the, the old ones – and not in china they don’t. %$* 101
believe me, okay? %$* 101
the marginal cost of coal generation is miniscule and that’s your price point. %$* 101
now, researching to see if you can beat it someday – i like that. %$* 101
i’m a techno utopian. %$* 101
anybody who reads anything i say, i love technology. %$* 101
i’ve, in my book i say, someday we’ll get there. %$* 101
but, you know, telling people today, you go ram it into twenty percent of the country – i don’t want to repeat myself. %$* 101
we will move these same industries over to china, as in fact it was just being suggested a moment ago, and they will make the products instead and make them dirtier. %$* 101
we will increase carbon emissions that way. %$* 101
in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) %$* 32
if we keep it at home at least we’ll have the scrubbers on the darn coal plants, even if we’re not taking the carbon out yet. %$* 101
we have time for one more question. %$* 13
gentleman, young man, yes. %$* 13
can you stand so that they know that i’m speaking to you? %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
and a mic will travel to you. %$* 13
um, hi. %$* 9
i have one very brief question and then another thing that i kinda want to, i’ll see if i can lump them in. %$* 9
one thing that hasn’t been addressed yet at all is peak oil. %$* 9
and i just want to kind of get that out there and see what some general reactions are. %$* 9
i know we’re planning on approaching that, at least within the next century – probably more likely within the next forty or fifty years. %$* 9
and that’s going to obviously affect our economy and the demand and supply that we have right now. %$* 9
and for people who don’t know what peak oil refers to-- %$* 13
peak oil is when we’ve hit, we’ve used up half of the world’s oil supply and beyond that the rate of production slows in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) dramatically. %$* 9
it kind of falls off on a bell curve. %$* 9

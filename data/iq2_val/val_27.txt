can you stand up, please. %$* 13
yes, just to your point. %$* 137
you said that they’re losing readership because consumers are looking for alternate ways of getting information. %$* 137
and i think part of the reason for that and a question to the panel is consumers are also looking for alternate opinions. %$* 137
and they’re finding that the mainstream media, when 70 percent of reporters say that they are democrats or registered democrats, are only giving one view. %$* 137
and this creates a problem because the people for getting information besides the mainstream media. %$* 137
phil bronstein. %$* 13
and that also goes to john hockenberry’s point, that by, just by the nature of the internet, the people working in it, to the degree that it’s journalism, are a far more diverse group than you’ll see in any newsroom you and i have ever worked in. %$* 13
well, i think it was jim who made that point and i read on the plane here a story-- %$* 132
i think it was michael’s story, maybe-- %$* 132
about politico. %$* 132
and that it was the founders of politico walking towards the camera. %$* 132
and they, while young, so there was a diversity there, they were all white males, as far as i could tell. %$* 132
maybe i’m wrong about that. %$* 132
so i don’t know how much diversity there is. %$* 132
i do know, i mean, i can tell you from personal experience. %$* 132
i did a blog post on sf gate, the chronicle site, talking about how nicely the press was treating president obama. %$* 132
and that post, widely circulated. %$* 132
i found out i had all sorts of friends i didn’t know. %$* 132
but, you know, that is not a story that i %$* 132
that’s been scarce. %$* 132
in fact, i’ve read them in the last week, not just, by the way, in mainstream media but on politico. %$* 132
it had a story today in which i was quoted, about how president obama is getting treated better than president bush was being treated, for doing some of the same things. %$* 132
so i don’t think that that’s an opinion that has been left out of mainstream media. %$* 132
i do realize there’s at minimum, a perception issue about the political bent of mainstream media. %$* 132
no question. %$* 132
john hockenberry. %$* 13
i think the question is much more profound than simply are there more registered democrats in whatever sort of hall of the media that you’re talking about. %$* 135
what is happening here is that the editorial process is fundamentally shifting to your point. %$* 135
and to your point if, distribution means of information is taken away from a small number of institutions the diversity is naturally going to increase. %$* 135
further, if you have people who want to actually engage in the editorial process they don’t go to one twitter. %$* 135
you know, they go to sixty or they go to sixty different platforms. %$* 135
i mean, they are a part of the editorial process in the same way that people who buy beatles rock band get to play ringo, if they want to. %$* 135
the idea is existentially being a part of the editorial process. %$* 135
truth telling and fact checking on their own is part of the experience that will become the business model of the future. %$* 135
and if the mainstream media can’t do that because their editorial process is closed they’re going to lose circulation exactly the way jim is talking about here. %$* 135
so we’re not abolishing journalists and we’re not abolishing newspapers. %$* 135
we are talking about a fundamental shift that changes the way these institutions have managed to survive. %$* 135
and good riddance to that. %$* 135
and that concludes round two of our debate. %$* 13
and here’s where we are. %$* 13
we are about to hear brief closing statements from each of the debaters. %$* 13
they will be two minutes each. %$* 13
and it’s their last chance to try to change your minds. %$* 13
and from the live audience vote beforehand we knew where you stood before this debate and here’s what we have. %$* 13
our motion is: good riddance to the mainstream media. %$* 13
and before the debate the vote among the audience members went like this: twenty-five percent are for the motion, fifty percent are against and twenty-five are undecided. %$* 13
you will be asked to vote one more time and pick the winner just a few minutes from now. %$* 13
but we want to move into round three, closing statements. %$* 13
and to speak first, against the motion-- %$* 13
and this is fortunate because you wanted to respond to what was just said-- %$* 13
speaking first against the motion in his summary remarks, phil bronstein, executive vice-president and editor-at-large of the san francisco chronicle. %$* 13
you know, i’m-- %$* 132
thank you. %$* 132
on the car ride over here i rode with jim. %$* 132
and jim actually acknowledged that many people, even himself, consider politico to be mainstream media. %$* 132
the point is really not about definitions. %$* 132
the arrogance that jim referred to in newspapers for losing circulation, i think that’s a very real problem. %$* 132
it has been a real problem and we have lost sight-- %$* 132
i call it the higher calling disease – of our mission. %$* 132
but i’m afraid i’m hearing a little too much of that same arrogance on the other panel about new media. %$* 132
because, let me tell you something, you haven’t heard from any of us that we think new media is bad. %$* 132
they’ve made a great case that new media has all sorts of possibilities. %$* 132
it’s like a great, wonderful shiny object. %$* 132
but the proposition you’re being asked to vote on is: good riddance to the mainstream media. %$* 132
therefore, the proposition says, mainstream media has to die. %$* 132
that’s the proposition. %$* 132
and my own experience is not that. %$* 132
my own experience is when i get together with biz stone, who is the co-founder of twitter, we talk about ways in which their massive pipeline of all that data and information and tweets might be able to be narrowed down into a verifiable set of facts that then professional journalists-- %$* 132
this is his view, and twitter’s view-- %$* 132
professional journalists then take it and run with it. %$* 132
wikimedia, i talked to one of their executives. %$* 132
he said, we rely deeply on mainstream media journalism. %$* 132
we are not arguing that that is the only way to go. %$* 132
our opponents are arguing that their way, that the new media way, is the only way to go. %$* 132
and i just find that to be not a credible proposition. %$* 132
so i urge you to vote. %$* 132
against the proposition. %$* 132
it can be confusing, yes. %$* 13
thank you, phil bronstein. %$* 13
summing, summing up his position, for the motion, michael wolff, a columnist for vanity fair and the founder of news aggregator, newser.com. %$* 13
michael. %$* 13
i’ve asked before how they’re going to do it. %$* 131
if they want to save, the mainstream media they gotta have a plan other than a government bailout. %$* 131
phil says we want the mainstream media to die, that’s what we’re advocating. %$* 131
that’s not the case. %$* 131
what we’re saying is that the mainstream media is dying. %$* 131
and it’s, going to die because things have changed. %$* 131
it’s become obsolete. %$* 131
there is new technology. %$* 131
so even if we wanted to preserve it and most of my day is spent in the mainstream media and i would love to preserve it another year, another couple of years. %$* 131
many of us about whether we will make it to retirement. %$* 131
i think actually we won’t. %$* 131
and i think that’s what we are trying to say here. %$* 131
it’s not to deny anything about the mainstream media-- %$* 131
its virtues or its faults. %$* 131
it’s just to acknowledge that something new has happened, a change is here. %$* 131
the mainstream media now is functionally detroit. %$* 131
so actually, it can probably go on. %$* 131
it can limp on and on and on. %$* 131
and then it won’t be able to limp on anymore. %$* 131
remember, we are all journalists here. %$* 131
we are arguing for our livelihoods. %$* 131
they’re arguing for their livelihoods. %$* 131
we are arguing for a new version of our livelihoods. %$* 131
but what you should focus on is the other people, the people we serve. %$* 131
we serve readers, we serve advertisers and we serve shareholders. %$* 131
and the mainstream media has failed in that regard and there’s no picking up the pieces. %$* 131
thank you, michael wolff. %$* 13
our motion is: good riddance to the mainstream media. %$* 13
and summarizing her position against the motion, katrina vanden heuvel, editor and publisher of america’s longest running weekly, the nation. %$* 13
it’s folly to deny that change is happening. %$* 134
i believe in accuracy. %$* 134
no one is talking about a government bailout for the media. %$* 134
but we are talking about a moment of transition and transformation. %$* 134
and in that moment your models-- %$* 134
some exciting-- %$* 134
are untested in terms of sustainability. %$* 134
and i believe, and i’m not going to use a cliché, john-- %$* 134
but i believe that it is not a moment to dispense with what has been of value in the mainstream media for what i believe is important, though it might be scorned up here-- %$* 134
which is accountability, democracy. %$* 134
i believe those are noble principles. %$* 134
and i do believe that we do need large, powerful institutions, barnacles attached, to take on powerful forces, whether corporate or government, and that the new media is beginning. %$* 134
not to demean the new media, but we need to find ways of working together to salvage quality journalism, which i believe is a public good in a society where there are too many voiceless and powerless. %$* 134
and to me that is much more important than the myth of this liberal bias in the media. %$* 134
it is who is heard and how people are heard and on a variety of platforms and of all political and ethnic and racial persuasions. %$* 134
so that is what i believe we should today understand coming out of this hall, and be against the motion: good riddance to the mainstream media, because there are important elements of that to preserve. %$* 134
and the new media lives with it, feeds on it and continues to need that, even though there is denial on the other side of the aisle. %$* 134
thank you to katrina vanden heuvel. %$* 13
summarizing for the motion, jim vandehei, executive editor and co-founder of politico.com. %$* 13
i would urge you to vote for the proposition and i think when you’re about to vote you should think about their argument. %$* 133
because i think they’re making a pretty powerful argument for us. %$* 133
what they want you to believe is that the mainstream media is something that it’s not. %$* 133
they want, they use words like hybrid or advancement or transformation. %$* 133
they’re basically trying to argue that they are new media and they’re not. %$* 133
the culture is different, the metabolism’s different. %$* 133
i think it’s emphatically clear that not only is new media superior, i think it’s our only hope for saving timely, serious, revelatory and profitable news. %$* 133
so i say, good riddance to the slow, detached, monolithic mainstream media, which we’ve had for the past twenty years. %$* 133
and i say that new media, we should respect the things that these guys have talked about. %$* 133
we do respect the values of fairness and accuracy. %$* 133
but i also think that all of us in this room should embrace the diversity, the transparency, the timeliness and the innovative spirit that you see in new media. %$* 133
that’s where the optimism is. %$* 133
that’s where the ideas are. %$* 133
that’s where our, for us news junkies, that’s where salvation is. %$* 133
i urge you to remember that new media is very much in its infancy. %$* 133
and we can sort of laugh it off and we can talk about baby water, all we want. %$* 133
but new media is working out its flaws. %$* 133
our people balance better the serious with the superficial. %$* 133
everyone’s aware that that’s an issue. %$* 133
people are grappling with it and it will be solved. %$* 133
and we will fill the role of, the traditional role of a public servant. %$* 133
you can’t do public service journalism, investigative reporting or foreign policy unless you make money or unless you have government subsidy or unless you have a not-for-profit status. %$* 133
you have to make money to be able to support doing the foreign coverage, to support doing the investigative coverage. %$* 133
i’m proud to say that profit, that politico is, in its third year, profitable and that soon we’ll be able to do more and more funding of the type of investigative reporting that we all love. %$* 133
we all share that. %$* 133
nobody is disputing that value. %$* 133
so with all that in mind i think it’s abundantly clear that you should vote in favor of the proposition because the news depends on it. %$* 133
thank you, jim vandehei. %$* 13
summarizing against the motion, david carr, media columnist and reporter for the new york times. %$* 13
i want to thank the audience for their attentiveness and you, john, for keeping all the frogs in the wheelbarrow and moving them down the road. %$* 136
tough job. %$* 136
and even though i said these guys had what i thought was a very tough set of facts, i take my hat off. %$* 136
i think you argued your case and argued it well. %$* 136
it does not mean i want you to vote for them. %$* 136
here’s the thing: we’re losing audience. %$* 136
mainstream media is not losing audience. %$* 136
we’re not a hybrid business. %$* 136
who is it that, to take one website i know about-- %$* 136
the new york times. %$* 136
we have eighteen million viewers. %$* 136
we have eight hundred and fifty thousand paper subscribers. %$* 136
we need people on all manner of platforms. %$* 136
politico, you’ll be interested to know, three times a week, puts a paper out on the street. %$* 136
why do they do that? %$* 136
because you gotta put the white paper out to get the green paper back. %$* 136
okay, that’s how it works. %$* 136
the problem that he has and the problem that i have is that over time the audience has switched to the web. %$* 136
the audience that’s worth a buck in print is worth a dime and sometimes a penny on the web. %$* 136
because we end up competing oftentimes against our own work, aggregated. %$* 136
newser is a great looking site and you might want to check it out. %$* 136
it aggregates all manner of content. %$* 136
but i wonder if michael’s really thought through getting rid of mainstream media content. %$* 136
okay. %$* 136
well, i’m thinking of the radio audience. %$* 13
i’m thinking of the radio audience and i was going to try to describe what you’re doing but i can’t. %$* 13
i have a rather holy sheet of newspaper-- %$* 136
newser, it’s absent mainstream media content. %$* 136
it looks like swiss cheese but who would want to eat swiss cheese every day? %$* 136
vote against. %$* 136
thank you, david carr. %$* 13
and finally, summarizing for the motion, john hockenberry, co-host of the public radio morning news program, the takeaway. %$* 13
so, david, thank you. %$* 135
now we know what those pilots on flight 188 were doing in the cockpit. %$* 135
cutting out little, pictures from newser. %$* 135
i indeed am honored to be here with my colleagues and it’s great working once again with john donvan. %$* 135
they have argued the point well. %$* 135
they have made a lot of points that remind us, perhaps nostalgically, of the journalism that we all love and that we all want preserved up here. %$* 135
but you must vote against them and for the proposition for the following reasons: they’ve not demonstrated that there is a way to stop the changes that are afoot. %$* 135
in fact, they’ve agreed that the changes are taking place. %$* 135
there’s no way to stop them. %$* 135
they have not demonstrated how journalism is, in fact, going away under our model. %$* 135
and they have not demonstrated that the current institutions they call the mainstream media are the only means for delivering quality journalism. %$* 135
what do they say? %$* 135
it sounds sometimes they’re saying, we are going away. %$* 135
don’t hate us. %$* 135
that’s pathetic and sad, but it’s not relevant. %$* 135
it sounds like they’re saying, we are being abolished. %$* 135
don’t let them. %$* 135
well, that’s simply untrue. %$* 135
they’re not being abolished. %$* 135
and in fact, they would argue that we should be abolished or that the new media should be regulated so as to prevent their content from being used in new media and having access to readers. %$* 135
finally, sometimes it seems like they are saying, we deserve to be protected, but they don’t say how. %$* 135
and because they don’t you must vote against them. %$* 135
they haven’t given us a practical reason why the mainstream media either should not go away or can be prevented from going away. %$* 135
finally, my brilliant colleague david carr would have you believe that the new york times started on this island with pulitzer prize winning journalists who said, we gotta start this paper to confront the government. %$* 135
and that’s not what happened. %$* 135
they started selling, they sold a lot, they made a lot and the core values of the new york times arose out of their success. %$* 135
the moment has passed. %$* 135
vote for the proposition. %$* 135
and that concludes our closing statements and i just have to say to all six of the debaters, no matter how this turns out after we ask the audience to pick a winner, you came with passion and commitment and i congratulate all of you. %$* 13
it was a pleasure. %$* 13
and now it is time to pick the winner. %$* 13
we are going to ask you again to decide which side you agree with and from that we will figure out, from that we will determine which side has argued best. %$* 13
we are asking you now to go to the key pad of each seat that will register your vote. %$* 13
and we will get this readout almost instantaneously. %$* 13
remember, push number one if you are for the motion: good riddance to the mainstream media. %$* 13
push number two if you are against, number three if you became or remain undecided. %$* 13
i’m going to have the results in just about ninety seconds so in the meantime i want to take care of a little bit of business. %$* 13
first of all, i want to thank of you and, again, our debaters for a terrific evening. %$* 13
our next debate will be on monday, november 16th. %$* 13
the motion is: obama’s economic policies are working effectively. %$* 13
panelists for the motion are: steve rattner, who served as counselor to the secretary of the treasury and as car czar: elliot spitzer, former governor and attorney general of new york: and mark zandi, chief economist and co-founder of moody’seconomy.com. %$* 13
against the motion we’ll have: james galbraith, economics professor at the lbj school of public affairs at the university of texas: economist robert kuttner, who is the co-founder and co-editor of the american prospect: and the seventy-second secretary of the u.s.treasury, paul o’neill. %$* 13
tickets are still available through our website and at the skirball box office. %$* 13
all of our debates, as we said at the beginning, all of our debates will continue to be heard on more than two hundred npr stations around the country and you can now also watch the debates on the bloomberg television network. %$* 13
air dates and times can be found in your program. %$* 13
oh, here they come. %$* 13
okay, here are the results of the debate. %$* 13
and remember, the team that changes the most minds will be declared our winner. %$* 13
and we now have the final results and they are: before the debate, twenty-five percent of you were for the motion, good riddance to the mainstream media: fifty percent were against and twenty-five percent were undecided. %$* 13
and before we reveal that, actually, when i come to the final result i’m going to raise my hand. %$* 13
i’ll ask you to applaud, and that’s for-- %$* 13
a little bit of a flourish on the radio broadcast. %$* 13
so when you see my arm go up, applaud. %$* 13
so i’m going to start this again. %$* 13
before the debate, our motion being: good riddance to the mainstream media, twenty-five percent of you were for the motion, fifty percent were against, twenty-five percent were undecided. %$* 13
after the debate, twenty-four percent of you are for the motion, sixty-eight percent against, eight percent undecided. %$* 13
the side against wins the debate. %$* 13
our congratulations to them. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
in the meantime, john donvan from intelligence squared u.s. %$* 13

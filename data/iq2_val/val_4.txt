it is a very serious problem that we have in africa. %$* 84
take nigeria for example. %$* 84
between 1970 and 2000, more than four hundred and fifty billion in oil revenue flowed into nigerian company coffers. %$* 84
now, according to nuhu ribadu, the chairman of nigeria’s anti- corruption commission, of that amount of money, four hundred and billion was stolen by nigeria’s military rulers. %$* 84
that’s a huge amount of money. %$* 84
sure, certainly we can point to “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” ngozi, who has been a reformer, but what did the obasanjo regime do to reward her? %$* 84
they sacked her. %$* 84
and now. %$* 84
if you look across africa as a whole, the african union itself says that corruption alone costs africa one hundred and forty-eight billion dollars every year. %$* 84
now, that’s more than five times the foreign aid africa receives form all sources. %$* 84
so, the issue %$* 84
as a matter of fact, africa doesn’t need aid. %$* 84
the aid resources africa needs can be found right there in africa. %$* 84
well, i want to make clear, if you think that, uh, this corruption in nigeria grew out of, uh, obasanjo’s regime, i think you're wrong. %$* 85
i didn't say that. %$* 84
we all, we all know sani abacha was the person who stole all the money in nigeria, but the nigerians, we got rid of him too, didn't we? %$* 85
every time we find corrupt politicians— %$* 85
sani abacha was worth five billion. %$* 84
babangida, eight billion, you can go all the way back. %$* 84
now, this didn't start, ok, recently, is start all the way back since the 1970’s. %$* 84
well i, i don’t disagree with you. %$* 85
you’ve got to remember one “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” thing, in this country, this country alone, and in the world, korean, and tehran, and japan, and from the civil war all the way up to teddy roosevelt, corruption was rampant in this country, but these countries still grow, they still became powerful countries. %$* 85
corruption alone does not destroy our country, it’s the amount of corruption. %$* 85
we’ll never eliminate it completely, but we can set in motion the conditions that will help eliminate this terrible thing. %$* 85
please, let the africans— %$* 84
and that’s why the africans now have played at something called knee pads too— %$* 85
let the africans decide for themselves how bad corruption is. %$* 84
and that sort of comparative analysis doesn’t help us. %$* 84
if you try to place corruption within washington context, for example, suddenly there is corruption, um, in dc, in dc government, and now the latest toll is that, you know, forty-three million dollars have disappeared because of tax fraud. %$* 84
but please, don’t compare that to africa. %$* 84
let the africans themselves determine the incidence of corruption and how important it is to them. %$* 84
and briefly, professor ayittey, on the question of the role in “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” reform that the us or un would have to play? %$* 79
well, the united states, the, um, world bank, united nations can be helpful, um, in reforming, try to help africa reform. %$* 84
but in the past they’ve been more of a hindrance. %$* 84
and that is one of the, look, if you want to reform africa, there’s six basic institutions that you need. %$* 84
number one, you need an independent and free media. %$* 84
that’s the first critical institution. %$* 84
americans take their media for granted. %$* 84
the second institution that you need is an independent judiciary for the rule of law. %$* 84
the third institution that you need is an independent electoral commission. %$* 84
five, four, i'm sorry, you need a, um, independent, you need to have an independent central bank. %$* 84
and then you want to have a neutral and professional armed forces and an efficient civil service. %$* 84
give africans these six institutions and it would do most of the cleaning out of africa. %$* 84
all right, hang, hang on, we need to, we need to move on to the next person. %$* 79
you’ll get a, you’ll get a chance. %$* 79
i am now ready to announce the results of the pre-debate vote. %$* 79
before the debate, twenty-four percent of you voted for the motion, “aid to africa has done more harm than good.” thirty-four percent of you voted against the motion, and the winner in the pre-debate vote, the winner in the pre-debate vote was undecided with forty-two “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” percent. %$* 79
this is an open-minded audience. %$* 79
now comes the fun part. %$* 79
where each of the panelists will have an opportunity to ask a question of the opposing side. %$* 79
gayle smith, you get the first question. %$* 79
oh! %$* 81
ok. um %$* 81
do you honestly, and any of you can take this, uh, your, your motion suggests that there is causality between aid and the continuation of poverty in africa, sort of like saying there is a mortgage crisis in the united states, and therefore we should get rid of banks. %$* 81
and my question is, are you suggesting that aid is the tool that is ultimately responsible for the eradication of poverty in africa? %$* 81
george, when you say that africans want reform, reform, reform, and you support a motion that says aid is doing more harm than good, are you suggesting that aid is the tool that’s going to bring about reform? %$* 81
my question boils down to wanting to understand whether you're giving aid far more potency than it actually ever could have, or indeed should have. %$* 81
i can take the first one, and %$* 82
so, what i was talking about was aid and economic growth. %$* 82
the expectation— %$* 82
let me just do, sorry, for the sake of the radio taping, um, william easterly? %$* 79
“aid to africa is doing more harm than good” %$* 79
yeah, ok, thank you. %$* 82
uh, what i was talking about is aid and economic growth. %$* 82
the expectation of the aid advocates was that aid would be invested and would create economic growth, that is a steady rise in living standards of the poor population, and would gradually lead them to exit from poverty. %$* 82
and that is what has not happened. %$* 82
uh, there has been aid but zero growth. %$* 82
now, john called this a spurious correlation. %$* 82
now, if any of you really do want to get tortured by economists i can try to give you some explanations of how economists deal with spurious correlations, but we have— %$* 82
i was actually referring more to the ethiopian shootings and aid. %$* 83
we have methods for, for dealing with, uh, correlations. %$* 82
we control for lots of other factors. %$* 82
we deal with causality, which is causing which. %$* 82
and at the end of the day the answer is pretty much the same, that aid does not generate economic growth. %$* 82
that was its promise, that, that promise it has failed to keep. %$* 82
but, but, if i may just very quickly, um, i consider myself one of those advocates, i have never ever presumed that economic growth was going to come, come about in africa because of aid alone, and i, and i think the fault underlying your motion is that “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” presumption. %$* 81
and i think what this side of the, the table would argue is that aid is one of those tools, and that it is having an increasingly positive impact, but that there are multiple other tools that must be brought to the table. %$* 81
there are the terms of trade. %$* 81
there are world market prices. %$* 81
there is governance. %$* 81
there is ending conflict. %$* 81
there is the arms trade. %$* 81
there is climate change. %$* 81
there are any host of other factors that must be brought to bear if you want to reduce poverty in africa. %$* 81
george ayittey, her initial question was to you, did you want to respond briefly? %$* 79
yeah, um, i um. %$* 84
i think, in the beginning paragraph, statement, she made a very interesting, uh, observation, and that is the complexity of this issue. %$* 84
you know, the way the question itself is framed doesn’t really allow us to address that. %$* 84
and the fact of the matter is, look, i personally believe that africa doesn’t need aid, and i have stated this. %$* 84
that africa’s begging bowl leaks horribly. %$* 84
i mean, you pour in aid, it just leaks out. %$* 84
number one, corruption. %$* 84
take the amount of aid which goes into africa every year. %$* 84
the total, from all sources, twenty-five billion dollars. %$* 84
compare that to the leakages. %$* 84
one hundred and forty-eight billion in corruption lost. %$* 84
eighty billion in capital flight out of africa every year. %$* 84
ok? %$* 84
how much money does that, do african “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” governments spend on the military and to purchase weapons? %$* 84
ok? %$* 84
fifteen billion. %$* 84
how much does africa spend a year to import food? %$* 84
twenty billion. %$* 84
back in the 1960’s, africa not only fed itself, it exported food. %$* 84
ok? %$* 84
if we are able to plug all these leakages, we’ll find more than enough money than, than double the aid that tony blair, tony blair and bono are going to give to africa. %$* 84
ok? %$* 84
that’s my position. %$* 84
but aid has become an industry replete with its own lobbies. %$* 84
ok? %$* 84
they want that to continue because aid, if you, if you ask george soros he will tell you that aid benefits the donors more than the recipients. %$* 84
they, they would like to have this thing continue. %$* 84
ok? %$* 84
what to do? %$* 84
all right, this is where i say that if you want to ask the africans, ask them what type of help they need. %$* 84
and this is where i believe that the mechanism that we have today, it’s not working. %$* 84
it has to be reformed so it benefits those that it is intended to do. %$* 84
david rieff, you’ve got the next question. %$* 79
yeah, i’d like, i think, i hope i'm right that it was john, that you said this, that, that you’re here to debate the present, not the past of aid. %$* 80
and i worry, just as a historical reading, and would ask you at least to consider the possibility that the argument you're making is the argument that the justifiers of aid have made pretty much every ten years since basically the fifties, since “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” the, the era of de-colonization. %$* 80
and i, i mean, this is actually not a polemical question, i’d like to know why you think this time it’s not simply a, as george says, a question of interest, but that one can actually legitimately say that the present of aid is, is different from all experience past? %$* 80
it’s a great question, i'm glad you raised it, david. %$* 83
i think, uh, the point i was trying to make is that it’s probably not a good use of our time to talk about something that happened in 1975, when our premise, our question is, is aid doing more harm than good. %$* 83
so that’s my basic point. %$* 83
we can sit here and play armchair quarterback over 1980, 1984, any year, 1962, there’s all sorts of stories, and when we turn on the news every night we’ll hear about the latest car crash. %$* 83
i mean, that’s the way these story tellings work. %$* 83
the reason i wanted to focus on the numbers is because i think the numbers tell a very different story. %$* 83
professor ayittey asked the question, well, what do africans want? %$* 83
well, in my conversations, quite sincerely, with africans in rural areas where, of course, you have to keep in mind just how poor rural africa is, these are places where they're lucky to see fifty dollars of cash in a year in a family, they're living, you know, the imputed value of the economy is, uh, estimated as many two hundred dollars per capita, in the poorest countries, they want, when i talk to them, fertilizer, bed nets, clean water, functioning “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” clinics. %$* 83
they want very practical things. %$* 83
and actually, george soros is supporting work to provide that, quite specifically. %$* 83
so, i think it’s important that we keep in mind what the amount of resources is that’s put into this. %$* 83
the us, or all time us foreign aid, because we’ve talked a little bit about the us, is about forty- eight billion dollars to africa all time since 1961.if you take out the food aid, of course, which is paying american farmers and shipping companies. %$* 83
you know, that’s about two dollars and fifty cents per african per year, it’s a very small amount of money, and i don’t know what you expect to buy from that. %$* 83
and just for, for context, forty-eight billion is, of course, about half of what is spend in one year in afghanistan and iraq. %$* 83
politics aside, to me that’s the comparison of a priority and not a priority in broad political terms. %$* 83
so, i’d be all too elated if we were sitting here talking about fertilizer, bed nets, anti-retrovirals, which programs worked, which ones didn't. %$* 83
i think we’re seeing that for thirty bucks per person, from all the rich countries all around the world, to africa, we’re getting about what we pay for. %$* 83
and john mcarthur, you get the next question. %$* 79
my question is actually, to the other side, is saying, for thirty dollars per capita per year, compared to, and i just use the past few years as a reference point, one point three million people on “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” anti-retrovirals, twenty percentage point increase in primary enrollment, three hundred and sixty thousand children a year’s lives saved from measles, and all the other practical programs we’ve heard of, what would be success, what would be, we’ve already heard that’s good, not harm, what would be satisfactory for thirty bucks per capita, because i don’t know how much you can buy with that money. %$* 83
professor ayittey. %$* 79
let me speak briefly to john, and that is, it’s true, you pointed out these success stories, but to me these success stories are really cleaning up the mess that past aid programs created. %$* 84
so they're doing good where there was harm. %$* 83
i have been to the villages myself, we are setting up malaria-free zones in villages. %$* 84
i have visited villages in benin, ghana, nigeria, kenya, we will establish, uh, we give, uh, villages malaria, i'm sorry, anti-malaria drugs, bed nets and so forth. %$* 84
everywhere that i got the villages tell me one thing, one thing that they tell me is this, look, governments have failed them. %$* 84
the government says, come around, around election time, to campaign, canvas for their votes. %$* 84
as soon as the vote, elections are over, they don’t see “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” them again. %$* 84
so they're asking you for bed nets, they're asking you for anti-malarial drugs because their governments have failed them. %$* 84
the next question goes to william easterly. %$* 79
ok, well, um, this question is partly based on my experience at the world bank where i spent part of my career, and uh, founded a not very effective bureaucracy to, uh, resolve the world’s problems. %$* 82
uh, i want to read a couple of quotes. %$* 82
uh, the first goes, "the international system is ill equipped to provide aid because of a shortage of effective institutional arrangements, and above all resolve to translate commitments into action." and the second quote is, "our foreign aid system is broken." so, it sounds like these quotes, uh, would, would be from this side of the table, but actually the first quote is from you, john, from the report “investing in development,” and the second quote is from you, gayle, from your testimony to congress. %$* 82
so it seems like you kind of agree that our foreign aid system is broken and it’s not working. %$* 82
so, i’d like to actually just read a quote, um %$* 83
says, "foreign aid likely contributed to some notable successes on a global scale, such as dramatic improvements in health and “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” education indicators in poor countries, life expectancy has risen from forty-eight years to sixty-eight years. %$* 83
forty years ago a hundred and forty-one out of every thousand babies born in poor countries died before reaching their first birthday. %$* 83
today thirty- six out of every thousand babies die. %$* 83
routine children immunization combined with measles vaccinations in seven southern african nations starting in 1996 virtually eliminated measles in those countries by 2000.donors collaborated on a program to wipe out river blindness in west africa starting in 1974, virtually halting the transmission of the disease. %$* 83
eighteen million children in twenty country area of the program were kept safe from river blindness since the program began." pause. %$* 83
"let’s put the focus back where it belongs. %$* 83
get the poorest people in the world such obvious goods as the vaccines, the antibiotics, the food supplements, the improved seeds, the fertilizer, the roads, the bore holes, the water pipes, the text books, and the nurses. %$* 83
this is not making the poor dependent on hand-outs, it is giving the poorest people the health, nutrition, education and other inputs that raise the payoff to their own effort to better their own lives." that’s exactly what i'm saying, that’s exactly what these success stories are doing, and i congratulate professor easterly for writing that in his recent book, white man’s burden. %$* 83
“aid to africa is doing more harm than good” uh, and i did write the line and testified before the senate formulations committee that our foreign aid system is broken. %$* 81
and it is absolutely broken. %$* 81
but that’s not what we’re here to debate. %$* 81
if we were, if the question before us is, is the us government foreign aid system broken, you would have unanimous agreement, this would be a very short debate, and we would be now drinking. %$* 81
what we’re debating is whether the aid that comes out of that system is doing more harm than good to africa. %$* 81
i don’t believe that it is. %$* 81
i think it could do a lot more good. %$* 81
i think it could do better, i think it could be more efficient, both in the eyes of american taxpayers, and importantly, as i think all of us agree, the africans whose lives it is intended to change. %$* 81
but on the question of the aid system, absolutely it’s broken— %$* 81
but are— %$* 79
as the aid itself— %$* 81
you are arguing that a broken system still does more good than harm? %$* 79
yes. %$* 81
“aid to africa is doing more harm than good” %$* 81
correct? %$* 79
yes, because if you look at what has been achieved, and i refer not only to the kinds of things that john talked about, but if you look at things like micro-finance, like a commodity exchange, like the provision of wireless services, those things matter in people’s lives, and i believe that that is doing good. %$* 81
could it do better? %$* 81
absolutely. %$* 81
c. payne lucas, you get the next question. %$* 79
well, i’d like to ask my friend george, all these corrupt governments in africa, first i’d like to know, is there any government in africa that’s not corrupt? %$* 85
second i would like to ask, if we end the aid, what should we, the us should do? %$* 85
should we not just give them anything, just let them fend for themselves, and just restrict our, our whole effort to trade? %$* 85
so what is your answer to the problem? %$* 85
by the way, i am surprised that the number of villages that you, when do you work, you travel to these villages all the time on a continent that got eight hundred billion people in it, and you tell stories that after eight years of working in the peace corps and seeing peace corps volunteers in the bush talk about what they’ve been able to “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” accomplish in working with africa is phenomenal. %$* 85
so my question is, what would you do if we end all this aid, so that corrupt politicians can't steal our money anymore? %$* 85
what would you put in its place? %$* 85
and especially in those countries that don’t have any natural resources, don’t have any infrastructure, and who are barely living on a hundred dollars a year. %$* 85
well um, first of all, corruption is not an issue that the us should fight, it’s africans who have to fight that battle themselves. %$* 84
ok? %$* 84
and uh, number one %$* 84
if you want to fight corruption, there are three basic institutions that you need. %$* 84
the first one, you need to have a free and independent media to expose it. %$* 84
that’s how you solve the problem. %$* 84
that’s the first thing that you do, expose the problem. %$* 84
the second is to have an aggressive attorney general to prosecute the corrupt. %$* 84
the third institution that you need is an independent judiciary to enforce the rule of law. %$* 84
we don’t have many of these institutions in africa, and that’s why i told you, i said that there’s six basic institutions that you need, an independent judiciary, and an independent media, free, free, an independent free media. %$* 84
uh, some of the institutions that we need to fight these battles ourselves. %$* 84
now, i'm not saying that, you know, corruption, that all african governments are corrupt, there are some which are honest, ok, the government of botswana, for example, uh, it’s a “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” very transparent government which is doing very well, there are also some african countries which have made progress, uh, in stemming the tide of corruption. %$* 84
but that’s not the issue, look, sometimes, american experts focus on the small success stories and ignore the larger picture. %$* 84
okay, the world bank was, you know, sort of, uh, been, uh, adept at this, you know, pointing out to economic success stories in africa, ignoring the larger pictures like, you know, the congo, somalia, ethiopia, zimbabwe and nigeria, countries which have collapsed. %$* 84
now, let me also— you asked me a question what should i—uh, what would i do, instead of, uh, foreign aid. %$* 84
i have indicated that the aid resources africa desperately needs can be found in africa, i coined the expression, “african solutions for african problems.” we’re not going to go to america, we’re not going to go to china, we’re not going to go to france, we’re not going to go to britain and beg and beg, because this devalues our pride and dignity. %$* 84
and this is why i said that the solutions to africa’s problems, lie in africa itself. %$* 84
george ayittey, you get to ask a question of the other side. %$* 79
all right, um— the question that i’d like to, um %$* 84
uh, ask, is this. %$* 84
and, and to the other side is this. %$* 84
we have heard about a lot of, um, humanitarian talk, now let me put this directly to you, um, and mr. %$* 84
c.payne lucas, since you have been involved in africa. %$* 84
“aid to africa is doing more harm than good” whom exactly do you want to help in africa. %$* 84
the african governments or the african people. %$* 84
now there’s a distinction between these two. %$* 84
most americans think that, the best way of helping the african people is by handing money over to their corrupt and incompetent governments, where do you stand on this. %$* 84
well i think we—i think we ought to help the african people. %$* 85
that’s why we have hundreds and hundreds of ngo’s who are doing programs all over africa which, the government never touches one dime of the money. %$* 85
that’s who we want to help, we wanna help the people. %$* 85
and those governments who want some help about how to create, uh, good governance and, and, and a free press and the rule of law, we stand ready to help them too. %$* 85
but you gotta remember, a lot of aid to africa never goes near the government bureaucracy. %$* 85
you gotta remember that, that’s an important piece of the work. %$* 85
all right. %$* 79
your turn, folks. %$* 79
as we now open up to q-and-a from the audience, please stand when you ask your question, and we ask that you do not start to ask your question until you have the microphone in your hand. %$* 79
please make your questions short and to the point, and members of the press, please identify yourselves, as such. %$* 79
so, we have a questioner on this side. %$* 79
“aid to africa is doing more harm than good” %$* 79
uh, this question is for professor ayittey. %$* 10
with the figures you gave it sounds like the corruption problem is much larger than aid. %$* 10
if aid stops, won’t the people suffering from the corrupt governments suffer further from that corruption. %$* 10
well, i think your question supplies its own answer. %$* 84
and that is %$* 84
if corrupt governments %$* 84
are making poverty worse, and i think the object of aid is try to remove those corrupt governments, and not to hand money over to them and sort of, uh, strengthen them. %$* 84
because, we know in the past, foreign aid simply propped up these bad governments. %$* 84
a question up on the left. %$* 79
hello, euvin naidoo, president of the south african chamber of commerce in america. %$* 86
i have a question for both sides. %$* 86
i think the example that john mcarthur picked of malawi’s success that was flagged, uh, over the weekend on the headline news in the united states, it’s quite prescient. %$* 86
malawi had a choice to make. %$* 86
they could have dropped bags %$* 86
of maize, as well as food from the sky %$* 86
flooded the market with product, and stopped farmers from %$* 86
selling their product profitably and stopping that market, instead they decided to empower farmers. %$* 86
so clearly to george’s “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” point smart aid is important. %$* 86
so the question is, what can be done %$* 86
mechanisms in place, to create or push governments to making those type of smart decisions. %$* 86
that stems to two quick questions, number one. %$* 86
as a fourth-generation south african and african people often talk about a marshall plan. %$* 86
discussing this with my african colleagues is often met as a suggestion of utter nonsense, or, it’s met as a suggestion that’s needed. %$* 86
it’s also been echoed by many us leaders as something that africa needs. %$* 86
is this part of the solution. %$* 86
the other point is that, in many discussions on aid, and particularly with african colleagues, many of us feel excluded from the decisions of where aid goes. %$* 86
is this a perception. %$* 86
if it is a perception, what can be done to alter this perception. %$* 86
if it is a reality that africans are not involved in these decisions of where these billions of dollars go, what can then be done, thank you. %$* 86
would somebody on the con side like to answer first? %$* 79
um, that— %$* 81
i just would wanna make a couple of quick points, uh, what— %$* 83
john mcarthur. %$* 79
“aid to africa is doing more harm than good” thank you, great question, and the malawi example is really important because it was about providing subsidies for fertilizer and seeds again, and it was, uh, donors who provided the aid to make that possible. %$* 83
it was a big fight, and then the government said that they wanted to do it, the president took the bold stand, his ministers took the stand, and they did it, and it reached a million households, again, doubling food production in just two years. %$* 83
the marshall plan is actually an interesting example for many reasons, because that actually worked out to, just for reference, $85 per european per year, in constant dollar terms. %$* 83
that was to a rich country doing a bunch of stuff after a war, we give, you know, a fraction of that to africa which has much deeper needs, and much deeper poverty today, when we give support totally of $30 per capita. %$* 83
but in terms of your last question of the exclusion from where the aid goes, it actually answers the marshall plan point too. %$* 83
i think the basic proposition has to be that the africans are empowered, the african countries, the societies within those countries, are empowered to put forward their own plans. %$* 83
to put in action their own proposals, that’s actually what’ s happened, with the global fund to fight aids, tb and malaria. %$* 83
the countries put forward their proposals, they submit the proposal to the pool of funds, and then, the funding actually is made available to finance “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” that proposal. %$* 83
that’s how we’ve got so many people on anti- retroviral treatment, that’s how we’ve got tens of millions of bed- nets distributed, so we’ve got millions of people on tuberculosis treatment as well. %$* 83
it’s that notion of supporting the african countries just like malawi, and just like it’s happened all over the world, to put in action their own plans. %$* 83
someone on the pro side? %$* 79
yeah. %$* 80
um, let me do it, if i may— %$* 80
david—david rieff. %$* 79
the, um—i, i, i think the marshall plan is precisely interesting because it, it %$* 80
comes back to the point that george ayittey keeps making and, and i think is the essential point which is the point of the state. %$* 80
the problem with the marshall plan, john, is not that it was $85 to a small number of states rather than $30.it was that there were functioning states there to administer it. %$* 80
the marshall plan would have had no hope whatsoever, of working historically, had the allied powers in the aftermath of world war ii not reestablished the german state %$* 80
for one thing, it was the first thing they did when they arrived. %$* 80
so you cannot get around this question, that as i say george ayittey keeps “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” raising, which is, your are talking— and it gets very fluid here, the answer was, well, societies, countries— well, what do we mean. %$* 80
what’s gonna happen, you’re gonna shoot your way in if you don’t like the state? %$* 80
uh, i mean societies, countries, we talk all this—i mean civil society is a %$* 80
descriptive term that keeps being min— misused in the, in the ngo world as a, as a—sorry, descriptive term, misused as a prescriptive term all the time. %$* 80
it’s not as if civil society can stand up to the power of the state like that. %$* 80
so that, you know, these, these models seem to me to avoid %$* 80
the problem, because precisely people don’t wanna talk about politics, precisely because i think, with all due respect, the mistake that both particularly us ngo’s and the un system make, over and over again, is the idea that as i believe one, either gayle or john put it, you can ring-fence it from politics. %$* 80
you can’t. %$* 80
let me %$* 81
may i? %$* 81
‘cause, ‘cause i—i %$* 81
i have a trouble—a problem with this %$* 81
motion ‘cause it’s not very scientific, i mean, what is aid. %$* 81
there’s us government aid, there are billions of dollars in aid, there’s the gates foundation. %$* 81
the prize that c.payne mentioned that was given to president chissano of mozambique was given by an african foundation. %$* 81
that was african aid, if you will, or african philanthropy. %$* 81
but i—i think there are, uh %$* 81
so, a number of things that are being conflated, “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” and these tools can be used effectively or ineffectively, and they’re not all the same, and some have constraints on them and some don’t. %$* 81
i—i think also on, on the marshall plan there’s something we’re ignoring here, we’re—again, we are suggesting somehow, that aid is like the invention of the wheel. %$* 81
and that aid is going to be the thing that transforms africa and i—and i think if we all thought about that we would reject that but the way we’re discussing it suggests otherwise. %$* 81
the marshall plan, yes, had to do, with reestablishing states. %$* 81
it also had a lot to do with policy, it wasn’t just aid. %$* 81
there were policies regarding the terms of trade and other things that were afforded europe that have not been afforded africa, so let’s not hold aid accountable, for the fact that the terms of trade are skewed against africa. %$* 81
our time is— %$* 79
the last—the last— %$* 81
—our stime is—time is starting to run very short— %$* 79
okay, just very quickly— %$* 81
but if you’re gonna— if you’re gonna make a distinction between government aid, and private aid like from the gates foundation, “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” what is that distinction, very briefly, and can private aid do things that government aid cannot— %$* 79
yes, i think private aid is much, much more flexible. %$* 81
at—at one level you’re right, david, i mean government aid is always going to have, to some extent politics but also taxpayer accountability, oh, but assuming that that’s something we can achieve again in the near term. %$* 81
is there any kind of— %$* 79
i—i— uh, but, but %$* 81
i have to make one point here. %$* 81
i think it is a gross disservice to africa, to suggest that all african governments are corrupt, that every leader is, is evil, that there are no african states, africa’s a very, very diverse place. %$* 81
and to that young woman who is 18 or 19 years old in ghana or zambia or even zimbabwe, who hopes to go to work in a government ministry to serve her people, i think we need to be a little bit careful, about suggesting that all governments in africa are bad. %$* 81
because god forbid if they don’t have governments, it all looks like somalia— %$* 81
there were 18-year-old women in stalin’s russia— “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” %$* 80
right— %$* 79
—who had the same ambition— %$* 80
but just thir—david, just— %$* 79
—i don’t see the point of that really. %$* 80
but— %$* 81
just 30 seconds on private aid, is there any— %$* 79
the point of that— %$* 81
—com—is there any common ground there? %$* 79
is the gates foundation aid— %$* 79
i—it used to be said in the '90s when george soros had more money, that he did what the united states didn’t have the money to do. %$* 80
i think this is quite, uh, an interlocking net of institutions. %$* 80
aid is a system, it’s an international system. %$* 80
the idea that somehow you can say, well, governments, that’s not good but somehow gates or soros— the truth is, this is one system, and “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” again, it’s a system that doesn’t work. %$* 80
okay, one more question, from the floor, who’s got it. %$* 79
does somebody? %$* 79
or no. %$* 79
all the way in the back. %$* 79
yes, bill hartung from the new america foundation. %$* 87
there was a brief mention of things like military aid, arms trade, war, so i figured i’d have a nice narrow question for the last one. %$* 87
do you think that aid, military or economic, can be part of a platform, can contribute to an effort to reduce conflict in africa. %$* 87
no, uh, i will also echo that, uh, i think, uh, generally when, when, when you talk about foreign aid, now of course there are several types of aid, there is humanitarian aid, uh, assistance, relief, like, you know, those that, uh, uh, the rich, uh, countries send out to victims of earthquakes and flooding, i mean that’s another thing, humanitarian aid. %$* 84
and then there’s military aid, and then there is official development assistance, oda. uh, that is what, uh, technically is called development aid and i think this question is about that type of, uh, assistance. %$* 84
one minute from this side? %$* 79
yeah, can i just say i think it’s important to keep in mind, uh, “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” how poor much of africa is. %$* 83
so, it’s actually not the right comparison to compare it to europe which was, you know, poorest country was maybe $5,000 per capita, uh, 50 years ago, 50 years ago. %$* 83
we’re talking about countries that, $200 per capita. %$* 83
where a bed net, or $8 for a school fee makes a big difference. %$* 83
so if you wanna actually, uh, prevent conflict, in places where the rains fail and people fight, and conflict is exacerbated, when the rains fail ‘cause there’s not enough food, i would support fertilizer and seeds to grow more food. %$* 83
this is a really practical point. %$* 83
i think we need to understand also that there are so many countries with great governments, and if there are 16 or 18 or 25 or however many where we can all agree the governments are fantastic, if it’s just about governance, why aren’t those countries just taking off all across africa, why aren’t we seeing 10 percent growth all across africa. %$* 83
because there’s more to it, and even the most heroic leaders in africa, in mali, and burkina faso, and tanzania, and malawi %$* 83
they’re all facing deep challenges of extreme poverty where people have no money, they can’t afford a bed-net, they can’t afford a $25 bag of fertilizer, a $10 can of seeds, and they’re too poor to get on that first rung of the ladder of economic development. %$* 83
and aid can help do that, it’s not enough to do that, but we have to understand what it is trying to achieve, and i think 1.3 million people on anti-retrovirals is a pretty good start. %$* 83
thank you. %$* 83
“aid to africa is doing more harm than good” and now the final remarks from the panelists, beginning with the side opposing the motion, panelists, please stay in your seats for these remarks. %$* 79
each debater has two minutes with a one-minute warning. %$* 79
gayle smith. %$* 79
uh— thank you. %$* 81
excuse me. %$* 81
i think it’s important to note that this debate is in the present tense. %$* 81
it’s not in the past tense, the question is, is aid to africa %$* 81
doing more harm than good. %$* 81
no, i don’t think it is, i think it’s more—doing more good than harm. %$* 81
can it do more good? %$* 81
absolutely. %$* 81
but i think if we hold aid accountable for all of africa’s ills we’re going to lose sight of what aid can do. %$* 81
aid is changing people’s lives, it is investing in transformation, it is imperfect but it has improved exponentially. %$* 81
and i think if you asked a majority of people, whether they be people whose children are alive today because they’ve got arv’s, or whether they be people who now have access to wireless internet and whether that aid came from a private foundation, from a government, from an individual through an ngo, i think they would say it’s doing a lot of good and i hope you will vote accordingly. %$* 81
one minute. %$* 79
you’re done. %$* 79
um— “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” %$* 79
i’m—i’m done. %$* 81
david rieff. %$* 79
well, i—i think the first thing you have to do is distinguish between aid and help. %$* 80
the reason that this side of the %$* 80
table has kept arguing and insisting that aid does more harm than good is not because we’re against help, but because aid is a system, and that system is corrupt, inefficient, and wrongheaded, in the main. %$* 80
that you can have a zillion anecdotes, that anyone would rather have, as i put it about humanitarianism, a bed for the night than no bed for the night, doesn’t make it a good system. %$* 80
and the thing is, yes. %$* 80
if a—if the only relief you get is someone bringing you a bed net, or some fertilizer, obvious—and the choice is formulated as, would you prefer a bed net, or would you prefer nothing, well, then sure, then you get a, you get a nice kind of enver hoxha style majority for aid. %$* 80
but those aren’t the choices. %$* 80
one minute. %$* 79
the choices are %$* 80
talking about things that would have—if implemented, fair trade being in my view the most important, “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” would have infinitely more positive effects, and that in effect by concentrating on aid, we’re ignoring in fact, the things that actually would make people’s lives better, that they would say, i’ll still take aid if my choices are aid and nothing. %$* 80
yeah, but, that’s really not the issue here. %$* 80
john mcarthur. %$* 79
thank you, and thank you to the panel and i, i just wanna stress that i’m of the view that we’re all aiming for the same ambition, which is to support people who want to, uh, make their own lives better throughout africa. %$* 83
and so i wanna also make sure we don’t lose track of the key question which is whether aid does more harm than good. %$* 83
david rieff in his opening comments rejected the proposition, ‘cause it’s not a good way to frame the question. %$* 83
we’ve talked about all these elements of the question, each of which suggest it’s just not a good way to frame the point. %$* 83
the point is, that for $30 per capita, even when i asked the question of the other side, they couldn’t answer what they expected— or they didn’t answer, what they expected to buy. %$* 83
‘cause $30 per person doesn’t buy you much. %$* 83
and the fact that we have so many successes, shows actually that aid can do tremendous good. %$* 83
does it solve all the problems in the world? %$* 83
no. %$* 83
is it enough to provide magic across the continent? %$* 83
no. %$* 83
“aid to africa is doing more harm than good” %$* 83
one minute— %$* 79
should we put it into the arms of corrupt leaders? %$* 83
no. %$* 83
do we do that on purpose anywhere? %$* 83
no. %$* 83
do we stop doing it across the continent when it’s caught? %$* 83
that’s the point. %$* 83
we need to focus on the things that people are asking for and they want, the bed nets, the fertilizer, the medicine, the schools. %$* 83
we’re seeing tens of millions of people benefit from those programs, not just the million that are getting then anti-retrovirals. %$* 83
that was the one that was impossible. %$* 83
and i urge you to reject this motion, ‘cause it’s not even the right way to think about supporting those who want it. %$* 83
thank you. %$* 83
thank you, and thank you to the panel and i, i just wanna stress that i’m of the view that we’re all aiming for the same ambition, which is to support people who want to, uh, make their own lives better throughout africa. %$* 83
and so i wanna also make sure we don’t lose track of the key question which is whether aid does more harm than good. %$* 83

no. %$* 83
“aid to africa is doing more harm than good” %$* 83
william easterly. %$* 79
well, i wasn’t the one who invented the objective of the end of poverty being the objective of aid, that’s the title of jeff sach’s book, uh, the boss of john mcarthur. %$* 82
uh, that’s the goal of the united nations millennium development goals to end poverty. %$* 82
and what i’m arguing, and all of us on this side are arguing is that’s an unrealistic and unobtainable goal, that aid cannot achieve the end of poverty. %$* 82
and in fact an aid system that is designed as it now to be mainly about ending poverty, cannot “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” even be held accountable for anyone doing even these modest, tangible things, that all of us agree are good things to do. %$* 82
because money does not unfortunately automatically translate into results. %$* 82
the fact that you can say, for example, that, uh, a 10-cent oral rehydration therapy kit will save a baby’s life from dying from dehydration due to diarrhea. %$* 82
that doesn’t mean that the 10 cents will—of course there’s enough money there to pay for these 10-cent kits. %$* 82
and yet still, two million babies died last year, from dehydration— %$* 82
one minute— %$* 79
—for lack of these 10-cent kits. %$* 82
and what i cannot support is an aid system that aims at these utopian objec—unobtainable objectives, of achieving the end of poverty, which is up to the africans themselves, not to, uh, patronizing western donors. %$* 82
and i would support a system that does focus on modest, tangible goals for the—that aid sys—that aid agencies will be held accountable for, that they will be blamed, when someone is supposed to get oral rehydration kits, and doesn’t get them and a baby dies. %$* 82
that is an aid system that would work but that is not the aid system that we have now. %$* 82
the aid system that we have now does more harm than good by propping up the corrupt autocrats, under the utopian objective that they are un—the “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” illusion of creating development. %$* 82
which aid has failed to make any progress on throughout its history. %$* 82
well, i wasn’t the one who invented the objective of the end of poverty being the objective of aid, that’s the title of jeff sach’s book, uh, the boss of john mcarthur. %$* 82
uh, that’s the goal of the united nations millennium development goals to end poverty. %$* 82
and what i’m arguing, and all of us on this side are arguing is that’s an unrealistic and unobtainable goal, that aid cannot achieve the end of poverty. %$* 82

and yet still, two million babies died last year, from dehydration— %$* 82
c. payne lucas. %$* 79
well, you know, this, this motion is, uh %$* 85
they’re ignoring the, uh, motion, it is not about the aid system. %$* 85
it’s not about ending poverty. %$* 85
it is about whether aid does good or harm. %$* 85
one of the things that we have this evening, we have to remember that aid is always changing. %$* 85
for the last 22 months, we have been meeting on the—a congressional mandate on how to make aid more effective. %$* 85
we created a millennium challenge account, which in one country like ghana we made $500 million available to the private sector, that the government had nothing to do with. %$* 85
in order to get that money they had to have, uh, rule of law, they had to have freedom of speech, they had to be accountable to the bookkeeping that we imposed, and it was run entirely by ghanaians. %$* 85
the question is, the new, the new paradigm for us in aid is, it must be locally owned, it’s the ownership has to be locally owned, it has to be sustainable, it has to be accountable, and it has to be evaluated all along the trail. %$* 85
so, we are now in a partnership with the religious and faith-based organizations, we’re in a partnership with our allies, we’re in a partnership with ngo’s, we’re in a partnership with doctors without borders, “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” coming together to find the right solution to make it work. %$* 85
we do know one thing. %$* 85
it has to be african-led, and african-owned. %$* 85
george ayittey, your closing remarks. %$* 79
well, thank you very much, i think, you know—i certainly understand, um, how— you know, americans are very generous people, and they certainly would like to help africa. %$* 84
but quite often, very often, they, they have been sort of encumbered by political correctness. %$* 84
the unwillingness to criticize %$* 84
bad polices in africa for fear that if you’re a white person and criticize a black african leader you’ll be labeled racist. %$* 84
that has silenced a lot of people. %$* 84
the nonsense in africa must stop. %$* 84
bad leadership is one of our many problems in africa. %$* 84
and the foreign aid donors compound this problem. %$* 84
let me give you an example, in 1979 a norwegian agen—aid agency went to kenya to help the turkana tribespeople. %$* 84
and the norwegian agen— agency decided, uh, the best way of helping the takana tribespeople is to build them a fish-freezing plant. %$* 84
after the plant was built at the cost of $25 all the media people were invited, even the— %$* 84
one minute— %$* 79
“aid to africa is doing more harm than good”—village brass band was invited. %$* 84
and, but there was a small problem. %$* 84
they discovered that the turkana people don’t fish. %$* 84
they raise goats. %$* 84
now, we have seen blunders upon blunders of such foreign aid programs in africa. %$* 84
now we are asking you to vote for the motion, not because we want to cut up aid—cut off aid, but, to send a strong message, that the system needs to be reformed, so that better aid, smart aid is sent to africa. %$* 84
thank you. %$* 84
and thank you to all our panelists for your eloquence and your passion tonight, it is now time for you to decide who carried the day. %$* 79
once again, please pick up the keypad attached to the left armrest of your seat. %$* 79
after my prompt, press 1 if you are for the motion, “aid to africa is doing more harm than good,” 2 if you are against the motion, or 3 if you are undecided. %$* 79
please cast your vote, now. %$* 79
so while your votes are being tabulated, and we’ll give you the results in just a minute, i wanna thank the debaters and the audience for all your good work, and before i announce the results of the vote i wanna take care of a few things. %$* 79
the next “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” intelligence squared us debate will be tuesday, january 15th here at the asia society and museum. %$* 79
the motion to be debated then is, “we should accept performance-enhancing drugs in competitive sports.” that %$* 79
will be moderated by nbc’s bob costas. %$* 79
the panelists for that apparently humorous framing %$* 79
are for the motion, former canadian ben johnston johnson %$* 79
new yorker writer malcolm gladwell, and profe— oh, he’s not with the new yorker anymore? %$* 79
and professor of pediatrics and bioethics at the university of wisconchin wisconsin norman fost. %$* 79
against the motion, sportscaster and creator of sports machine george michael, former major league baseball outfielder and catcher dale murphy—he was good—and richard pound, chairman of the world anti-doping agency. %$* 79
that’ll apparently be an evening full of mirth. %$* 79
an edited version of tonight’s intelligence squared us debate can be heard locally on wync-am 820, on sunday, december 16th at 8 p.m. %$* 79
these debates are also heard on more than 80 npr stations across the country, please check your local npr member station listings for dates and times of broadcast outside of new york city. %$* 79
copies of books by william easterly—only i can see this—and “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” david rieff are on sale upstairs in the lobby, you can also purchase dvd’s from previous debates, here tonight or from the intelligence squared us website. %$* 79
and now, the debate results. %$* 79
remember before the debate you voted 24 percent for the motion, 34 percent against the motion, and 42 percent undecided. %$* 79
after our debaters did their best to sway you, you voted, 41 percent for the motion, 51 percent against the motion, 8 percent were undecided, which means those opposed to the motion have carried the day. %$* 79
congratulations. %$* 79
and thanks again to all of you for coming, good night. %$* 79

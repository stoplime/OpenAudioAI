i would now like to introduce robert rosenkranz, chairman of the rosenkranz foundation, the sponsor of intelligence squared, who will frame tonight’s debate. %$* 79
please welcome bob. %$* 79
well, thank you very much. %$* 1
with me is dana wolfe, our executive producer, and it’s our pleasure and honor to welcome you to, now, the final, uh, debate of our fall season. %$* 1
uh, you know, perhaps it’s less expensive to save a human life in sub- saharan africa than anywhere else on the planet. %$* 1
the vision of babies dying from easily preventable diseases just stirs our sense of common humanity. %$* 1
it’s not difficult to, uh, control the spread of hiv/aids, to reduce iron deficiency anemia with dietary supplements, to fight malaria with chemically treated mosquito netting. %$* 1
each of these strategies offers exceptionally high “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” benefits, and saves lives, versus the relatively modest costs involved. %$* 1
so, how then might aid to africa do more harm than good? %$* 1
it might do so by further entrenching despotic governments at the expense of an energetic private sector. %$* 1
in africa, many leaders simply use the machinery of the state to enrich themselves, their cronies, and their kinsmen. %$* 1
when additional resources are provided to such states, however noble the humanitarian goals, a substantial share ends up in the pockets of the swiss bank accounts of the leaders and their principal supporters. %$* 1
the more resources such leaders command, the longer they can stay in power. %$* 1
so, the question tonight is, has aid to africa produced measurable improvements in health, nutrition, education, and incomes, or has it simply entrenched bad governments and bad ideas? %$* 1
we have an outstanding panel this evening, moderated by brian lehrer, the award-winning host of new york public radio’s thoughtful and informative talk show. %$* 1
it’s my pleasure to welcome brian back to another debate. %$* 1
thank you so much for that kind introduction, bob. %$* 79
you know, on my radio show, i sometimes say that if we in journalism were really honest, we would have the same lead story every day. %$* 79
twenty thousand children died today of hunger related causes. %$* 79
“aid to africa is doing more harm than good” most of those deaths were preventable. %$* 79
imagine if twenty thousand people were killed once in a terrorist attack. %$* 79
or airplane crash. %$* 79
we would turn the world upside down to make sure it didn't happen again, as a matter of policy, and we would cover it to the ends of the earth, as a matter of news. %$* 79
but twenty thousand children a day, and hardly anyone in the west or the north even realizes it, and it never leads the news. %$* 79
disproportionately, those children are in africa. %$* 79
so, tonight’s topic may not be the sexiest one in this year’s intelligence squared us series, but i'm certain that it’s the most important. %$* 79
with that, i’d like to welcome you to the fifth debate of the second intelligence squared us series, the resolution being debated tonight is: “aid to africa is doing more harm than good.” now, let me give you a run down of the evening. %$* 79
members of each team will alternate in presenting their side of the argument. %$* 79
presentations are limited to eight minutes each. %$* 79
when opening arguments are complete, i will open up the floor to brief questions from the audience. %$* 79
after the q&a, each debater will make a final two minute summation. %$* 79
as you’ll see, they’ll also get a chance to ask each other some questions, and i’ll have some follow-ups as well. %$* 79
and finally, you will vote on tonight’s motion with the keypad attached to the armrest of your seat, and then i’ll announce your decision on which side carried the day. %$* 79
so, let’s start with the pre-debate vote. %$* 79
please pick up the “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” keypad attached to the arm rest on your left, on your left. %$* 79
for audience members sitting along side the aisle to my right, your key pad is attached to the arm rest on your right side next to your neighbor’s. %$* 79
again, tonight’s resolution is: “aid to africa is doing more harm than good.” and after my prompt please press one to vote for the motion that it’s doing more harm than good, two to vote against the motion, or three if you are undecided. %$* 79
you may begin voting now. %$* 79
anyone need more time? %$* 79
now i know what it felt like to prompt an sat exam. %$* 79
and i will reveal the results of your vote later in the evening. %$* 79
i’ll now introduce the panel, please hold your applause until all six are introduced. %$* 79
for the motion, the president of the free africa foundation, and distinguished economist in residence at american university, george ayittey. %$* 79
professor of economics at new york university, co-director of nyu’s development research institution, and non-resident fellow of the center for global development, william easterly. %$* 79
and contributing writer to the new york times magazine, and contributing editor to the new republic, david rieff. %$* 79
against the motion, co-founder and former president of africare, senior advisor to allafrica global media, and president of the business consultancy lodestar, c.payne lucas. %$* 79
associate director of the center for globalization and sustainable development at the earth institute at columbia university, senior macroeconomic advisor in the un development “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” program’s africa bureau, and former deputy director of the un millenium project, john mcarthur. %$* 79
and senior fellow at the center for american progress, and former senior director for african affairs at the national security council, gayle smith. %$* 79
and panelists, when you get down to one minute left to go in your eight minutes, i will just say the number one, and i will stop you after eight minutes. %$* 79
so, please be ready to conclude at that point. %$* 79
gayle smith gets the first remarks. %$* 79
gayle smith, please go to the podium. %$* 79
oh really? %$* 79
that’s not what it says here. %$* 79
um, ok, so forgive me for the confusion, dana, is it, is it david first? %$* 79
ok, and so maybe we should just clear this up now. %$* 79
uh, who’s second? %$* 79
ok, so they're reversed, for/against, and then who’s third? %$* 79
and then william easterly? %$* 79
and then the last two will be lucas and ayittey? %$* 79
ok. in that order? %$* 79
i'm, i'm just looking at what’s in my script. %$* 79
so, so let’s see, ayittey, ok, ayittey and lucas at the end, so let me just confirm the whole thing one more time, forgive me folks, um, david rieff one, gayle smith two, john mcarthur three, william easterly four, then ayittey five, and lucas %$* 79
yes, we have to go back and forth %$* 79
ok, so wait a minute, where’s %$* 79
all right. %$* 79
i thought this was going to be the “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” easy part. %$* 79
um, if rieff is first and smith is second, then easterly is third, that makes sense, and mcarthur is fourth, and, and ayittey is fifth, and lucas is sixth. %$* 79
so we’ve got it now, right? %$* 79
senator clinton will get the first question %$* 79
david rieff, please go to the podium. %$* 79
well, it’s always nice to have a logistics glitch, because it gives you a tiny bit more time to think about what you might say of any interest. %$* 80
um, let me start by saying something that isn't in the spirit of these debates, which is that i actually think there’s quite a large middle ground on this question, and i'm, you know, i don’t mind a good scrap, as any one of you who knows my work will know. %$* 80
but i don’t think that it’s simply a question of saying all aid is terrible or, or um, all aid is good, i think to the, you know, in the way that i want to invite you to vote for this, uh, resolution, it’s that on balance aid is, has done more harm, the resolution is well phrased, than good. %$* 80
it’s not that it’s a great, vast, you know, right wing conspiracy, or left wing conspiracy, i suppose, in the instance. %$* 80
um, it’s not that aid, some aid programs don’t work, and have not been shown to work. %$* 80
the problem, i think, and the reason that i, again, invite you to at least think hard about supporting this resolution, is that the whole discussion of aids avoids, makes a kind of moral and “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” historical end run around the problem of politics. %$* 80
it becomes, if you like, a kind of technical question. %$* 80
there are these suffering people, as mr. %$* 80
rosenkranz and mr. %$* 80
lehrer both described to you. %$* 80
we do or we don’t have the modalities to efficiently succor them. %$* 80
that is the aid narrative, if you will. %$* 80
and that is a narrative that, largely speaking, deprives the recipients of aid of their agency, infantilizes them, and also make sour aid a super-political, extra- political, moral question. %$* 80
it becomes a moral imperative, therefore we can't talk about the politics, we can't talk about whether the un system actually works, which in my view, palpably, it doesn’t. %$* 80
um, that’s another, perhaps another debate, about which i would be more categorical. %$* 80
um, it is, it doesn’t, but it most of all doesn’t reckon with the fundamental question that people are not saved from outside, people rescue themselves, fundamentally. %$* 80
they can be helped, there’s nothing wrong with aid at the margins. %$* 80
if aid were less ambitious, if aid has less of a kind of globalizing, dare i say it, totalitarian program, i would support it, as i support emergency relief, which at least in my understanding of emergency relief, is not long term development, but rapid entry and departure in major, usually war or refugee movement emergencies. %$* 80
the words are unsatisfactory, but that’s more or less what it is. %$* 80
i don’t, i, i’ve worked in that field, and i do not think there is anything wrong with it. %$* 80
on the contrary, i think if done properly, if it doesn’t become a stalking horse for “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” some ideological position, say liberal human rights, which i would insist is not simply the way the world is at its just, at its most just, but an ideological position. %$* 80
that you, if it does what it’s meant to do, which is, as i wrote in a book on this subject, offer a bed for a night, but not hope to save people, to transform society, et cetera, then i think that, the value of that aid, assuming it’s honestly given, and competently given, is indisputable. %$* 80
what is not indisputable by any stretch of the imagination is the idea that foreign institutions and governments and inter-governmental organizations, notably the european union and the un system know how to fix other people’s difficulties. %$* 80
the problem with aid, in short, is that it sets itself up as the kind of know all and end all. %$* 80
now of course aid people will tell you this is no, not the case anymore, that was true in the bad old days of lou preston and the world bank, it was true when all aid workers were, in africa were, were white, it was true when, if you like, the aid system was kind of a direct follow on both of religious proselytizing, missionary impulse, and uh, colonialism. %$* 80
but the truth of the matter is that that old texas adage, the man with the gold makes the rules, becomes, that definition of the golden rule, i mean, is as true today as it was when the french flag waved over and i don’t think it can ever be different. %$* 80
so that what you have with aid by definition is outsiders telling people in a place how to do it, and telling them if “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” they don’t behave satisfactorily, that is the best practices that you now see in humanitarianism, if you're not democratic, if you are not transparent, fi you don’t do this, that, or the other thing, then we will withdraw the aid. %$* 80
well, if ever there was an example of any unequal form of relations, i would submit to you that that’s it, which is why, precisely, in depriving people of their agency, aid does more harm than good. %$* 80
it does some good, i, again, i insist on the point that there is middle ground here, but it does more harm than good. %$* 80
moreover, it does seem to me that the emphasis on aid is misplaced, and that if you want to talk about what can be done in a place like africa, but not only in africa, i mean, after all there are other parts of the world that are unfavored in this moment in history for many of the same reasons, you might talk about fair trade a lot more than talking about development aid. %$* 80
thank you. %$* 80
gayle smith, you may now take the podium. %$* 79
uh, good evening everybody, and david, you were supposed to say all aid is bad and should be ended forever to make my life much easier. %$* 81
thank you for inviting us here this evening, and i want to strongly oppose the motion for a number of reasons i’ll share with you. %$* 81
first i think it oversimplifies an issue that “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” warrants our attention and our engagement over and above our opinions for the simple reason that a lot of lives are at stake, and more importantly, dignity is at stake. %$* 81
and i think the motion conflates aid and policy, aid and politics, while overlooking, in fact, how complex aid is. %$* 81
aid is provided by governments, in the case of our own government, we have twenty different pools of assistance provided by different agencies, some of them more effective than others. %$* 81
it’s provided by philanthropists, including african philanthropists in africa. %$* 81
and it is provided by ngo’s. %$* 81
it’s a very complex instrument, and to lump it all together, i think, is to obviate the, obviate the good it can do. %$* 81
third, and i think very obvious, it implies that therefore we should stop it. %$* 81
um, and i think that this would be a, a cataclysmic mistake for reasons i will get to. %$* 81
importantly, it overlooks the many successes, and you’ll hear more about this tonight, but particularly in health and education, and also in areas of economic transformation. %$* 81
let me give you three examples. %$* 81
ethiopia today has the first ever commodity exchange. %$* 81
this is critically important for farmers to be able to determine what prices they can get, and for trade to, to speed up within ethiopia itself and within the region. %$* 81
it’s a great thing that can transform agriculture in that country. %$* 81
in part it was initially funded by aid. %$* 81
let me give you a second, wireless access in africa has had a huge impact, it’s allowing farmers in rural areas to call and see “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” what prices are being tomatoes in the market, and cut out the middleman that might undercut them and reduce the number of dollars they get. %$* 81
that wireless transformation has come in part from the private sector, in part from local governments, and in part from aid. %$* 81
third, microfinance, something we hear an increasing amount about, as transformative in the immediate lives of their families and communities. %$* 81
a lot of that money is generated from microfinanced funds themselves but a lot of that has also come from aid. %$* 81
i think that it’s a very out-of-date debate, it kind of overlooks the many things that are going on now about aid that i think will change it, for example today, the majority of country directors for american ngo’s in africa are africans. %$* 81
that wasn’t true 10 days ago, that has an enormous %$* 81
impact. %$* 81
the new awareness about aid among americans, about a civil society in africa, is forcing a new transparency which is critical, to hold aid providers and aid recipients to account. %$* 81
dictators were many times supported in the past and—and i wish i could say they would never be supported again, uh, we can talk about the elections later but for now, i think we’ve seen an important transformation, consider zimbabwe. %$* 81
where robert mugabe i believe is trying to run the country into the ground. %$* 81
the bulk of foreign aid to zimbabwe now is going to civil-society institutions, that are trying and doing a very good job of protecting the institutions that can serve that “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” country well, in the future. %$* 81
it also obviates and overlooks an important debate that’s going on now that i think is, is critical for our future, and gets to a point david made about aid and politics, there’s no question that politics has affected aid and aid has often been driven by politics. %$* 81
the emerging debate now among policy-makers, among ngo’s, among africans, uh, among many, is that foreign aid in the case of the united states needs to be elevated, number one, so that it is on par with some of our other foreign-policy institutions. %$* 81
but more importantly, protected, from the politics that would drive it in the wrong direction. %$* 81
that in other words we need to learn how and move towards ring- fencing development assistance, so that it can’t be used %$* 81
for reasons other than development. %$* 81
i think to, to sug—to vote for a motion that said aid—aid is doing more harm than good, uh, undercuts that very important debate. %$* 81
the last point i would make is that i—i think the reason this, this motion is flawed is because at the end of the day development matters. %$* 81
and at the end of the day, the united states as a government, citizens of the united states, private companies in the united states, philanthropists in the united states, as around the rest of the world, i believe, have a responsibility and an interest in promoting development. %$* 81
i think it is a moral interest, it’s an economic interest, i think it’s a security interest, i think it has everything to do as well with our leadership. %$* 81
so i would also say “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” in conclusion, that if we conclude that aid is doing more harm than good, and therefore we should get rid of it, what’s our alternative. %$* 81
will we use the military as our primary means of doing our bit to contribute to africa’s development in the future? %$* 81
i hope you will agree with me that that would not be the right way to go. %$* 81
thank you. %$* 81
a very— a very efficient panel so far, i haven’t had to throw anyone off the podium yet. %$* 79
william easterly, your turn for your opening remarks. %$* 79
good evening. %$* 82
i wanna talk to you about two tragedies that have %$* 82
are covered by this debate. %$* 82
the first tragedy we’ve already heard about, that there’s a lot of unnecessary human suffering in africa. %$* 82
that for example, children’s lives could be saved for a 12- cent dose of anti-malaria medication, could save them from dying from malaria. %$* 82
and that is in—indeed a tragedy that children are dying for lack of a 12-cent medicine. %$* 82
everyone here on the panels agrees that’s a tragedy and feels compassion at this enormous tragedy. %$* 82
there’s also a second tragedy and that’s— this is a tragedy that we hear a lot less about. %$* 82
and this is the tragedy that we’ve already spent as official donors $600 billion in aid to africa over the past 45 years, and after all that children are “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” still not getting the 12-cent medicines. %$* 82
so there were still between one and three million deaths from malaria last year. %$* 82
so aid would be a great thing if it worked. %$* 82
but the sad tragedy is that—and this is really one of the, the scandals of our generation is that mo—money meant for the most desperate people in the world, is simply not reaching them. %$* 82
$600 billion in aid to africa over the past 45 years, and over that ti—over that time period there’s basically been zero rise in living standards. %$* 82
zero rise in incomes in africa. %$* 82
the money is simply not reaching the people for whom it is intended. %$* 82
and yet, the advocates of aid always focus their energies simply talking about this number, about how much we spend in aid, as if that in itself were an achievement of some kind. %$* 82
this goes back, it—every generation calls for an increase in aid to try to resolve the problem of development. %$* 82
it goes back to an advisor to john f.kennedy named walt rostow who called for doubling foreign aid way back in 1960.in 1973 world bank president mcnamara once again called for doubling of foreign aid. %$* 82
actually this is something that i noticed in my research which, uh, as a professor you’re always kinda proud when you discover an empirical irregularity that really fits the data perfectly. %$* 82
and that is that when people call for an increase in aid they always call for exactly double. %$* 82
it’s always exactly 100 percent increase. %$* 82
never, you know, 117 percent or 83—it—it’s amazing. %$* 82
so this has continued to the “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” present, the 2005 g-8 summit called for doubling aid to africa. %$* 82
barack obama’s called for doubling aid to africa, jeffrey sachs has called for doubling aid to africa. %$* 82
uh, even our president george w.bush called for and has already implemented an—an increase in us aid of 50 percent. %$* 82
i did worry for a moment that that didn’t fit my law, but, uh, i checked with the white house staff and they explained to me that he thought 50 percent was double. %$* 82
so what—what—what good does it do to focus on the amount spent, uh, this obsession with the amount spent on aid, if the balance of the evidence suggests that the, the money is not reaching the poor-- %$* 82
sure, there is the occasional success, which we will hear about from time to time tonight, but the balance of the evidence is simply that, $600 billion went into africa and income did not rise. %$* 82
so where did the money go? %$* 82
well, unfortunately a lot of it went to corrupt rulers, to corrupt and autocratic rulers. %$* 82
today, despite all the talk of action against corruption, two-thirds of all aid today goes to rulers who have the worst rating on corruption. %$* 82
two-thirds of aid going to corrupt rulers. %$* 82
this is actually getting worse over time. %$* 82
there’s no evidence of any sort of post-cold war break, in which, you know, in the bad old days aid when to corrupt dictators and now it goes to good guys. %$* 82
and by the way, uh, gayle, ethiopia is a good example, the, the ruler of ethiopia is a guy named meles who is a dictator who shot down unarmed “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” demonstrators in the street, this is a guy who has been a darling of the aid community. %$* 82
this is not the kind of aid that accomplishes good, this is the kind of aid that does more harm than good. %$* 82
and in fact, aid has gone into states that subsequently collapsed into warlord anarchy. %$* 82
there was a lot of aid that went into sierra leone, liberia, somalia, the democratic republic of the congo, rwanda, even up to the moment when the genocide broke out in rwanda, there was still aid money going into rwanda, in fact even after the genocide broke out the french were still supplying the rwandan government, committing the genocide with aid dollars. %$* 82
some of it military aid, obscenely enough. %$* 82
and so i say to you that aid, uh, and this is borne out by his—by statistical evidence, that aid worsens corruption, aid blocks democracy, aid is an obstacle to the freeing of africans from predatory rulers %$* 82
and i think we have no choice but to, to vote for the motion tonight, we, we cannot be satisfied with this record of aid, that has promised so much and accomplished so little. %$* 82
we must condemn the sorry record of aid for the sake of africa, and for ourselves. %$* 82
it’s simply unacceptable that a system which is supposed to have the best intentions, is simply making things worse rather than better. %$* 82
john mcarthur, your opening remarks. %$* 79
“aid to africa is doing more harm than good” thank you, and thank you to everyone for joining tonight and, uh, thanks to members on all sides of the panel. %$* 83
i think it’s important to go back to the point that david rieff made of understanding, even he of course supported rejecting the motion, ‘cause it’s so strong, and, uh, ambiguous as to what it even means. %$* 83
if we think about what aid actually achieves, and what it doesn’t achieve, we have to make sure we avoid the, uh, spurious correlations that have been mentioned tonight, just because two things happened at the same time doesn’t mean one is responsible of course for the other. %$* 83
but we also have to think about the framing of this statement, which is about the present tense, not the past. %$* 83
we’re not here to discuss and debate president mobutu tonight. %$* 83
we’re here to talk about whether aid is doing more harm than good. %$* 83
and on that, there are four basic points i think we need to keep in mind. %$* 83
the first, is that it’s often understood or misunderstood, that bad governments and corruption are responsible for africa’s poverty, and singularly responsible. %$* 83
professor ayittey often refers to the cheetahs of the new generation and the hippos of the last generation. %$* 83
well, what about the cheetahs of the new development generation, the cheetahs of the new aid generation that are re—producing remarkable results across the board. %$* 83
when we actually look at the statistical evidence, as professor easterly does and i do and “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” others, we see that, even when we compare governments with equal levels of good governance, we see that africa on average grows about 2 percent per year slower than other developing countries around the world. %$* 83
why is that? %$* 83
why is it that, countries like ghana and senegal have better transparency international ratings than china and india, while it still grows so slowly while china and india take off? %$* 83
why is it that vietnam grows so quickly, while it has governance ratings so far below tanzania, or burkina faso? %$* 83
it’s because of the issues of disease, it’s the lack of infrastructure, it’s the lack of education, it’s the terrible legacy of colonialism. %$* 83
but it’s about much, much more than bad governments. %$* 83
there’s no question that a bad government can drive a country off a cliff, but aid is about tackling those very practical challenges of health, education and infrastructure, if it’s to be done properly. %$* 83
now, professor easterly discussed the $600 billion of aid to africa. %$* 83
that’s the second myth is that this is vast sums down the drain. %$* 83
how much is $600 billion if we think about it per african, per year. %$* 83
if you divide that over all the years over all the africans, by my estimate it’s maybe $28 per african per year. %$* 83
that’s all the money going down the drain. %$* 83
and then, there’s the third issue, well what we do we get for it, we’ve heard that nothing, nothing has been achieved. %$* 83
well let’s talk about some of those successes. %$* 83
there’s the smallpox eradication that happened around the world, of “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” course, thanks to, i have to say the un’s world health organization that set up the target, set up a smallpox eradication unit, and got rid of the disease. %$* 83
there’s the fight against aids.in 2002 we had perhaps 50,000 people on anti- retroviral treatment in africa. %$* 83
thanks to the creation of the global fund to fight aids, tb and malaria, and the us president’s emergency program for aids relief, we now have well over a million people on anti-retroviral treatment within just five years. %$* 83
and for those of us who were in the trenches five, seven years ago, this was considered impossible. %$* 83
impossible. %$* 83
we have throughout africa primary enrollment rates since 1991 alone up 20 percentage points. %$* 83
just last week we had the news that unicef, the red cross and others had cut measles death in africa by 91 percent, between 2000 and 2006, from nearly 400,000 people a year, children, to 40,000 a year. %$* 83
they actually set a target to do that by 2010 and they were four years ahead of schedule. %$* 83
of the 20,000 deaths a day, that our moderator pointed out at the beginning, those 360,000 are 1,000 a day of the to—the total. %$* 83
that was aid backing it. %$* 83
that was unicef, that was who, that was the american red cross, that was the center for disease control working governments and the government national plans, and they got the job done. %$* 83
in malawi, many of you might have seen the new york times front- page story on the weekend, where aid supported the national “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” government to implement the plan that it wanted to implement, to get fertilizer and seeds to farmers, and in just two years, we saw a full country, one of the poorest countries on the planet, with a better governance rating than many countries growing much faster than it, double its food production, from one ton per hectare, to two tons per hectare, and it’s now actually an aid donor in the region. %$* 83
so we have to reject these myths, we also need to reject the one about trade, the fourth one, that it’s trade, not aid. %$* 83
we all want trade, we all want aid, and we all want market development, and we wanna focus on the practical things that can be done to reduce poverty and to support the countries to reduce poverties on their own terms. %$* 83
so let me just conclude by saying first, just screaming governance and corruption is simply not the case. %$* 83
it’s too simplistic and it ob—obscures the underlying truth of disease, lack of infrastructure, lack of education in africa. %$* 83
second, the scary big numbers that we often hear, are often quite tiny, in fact minuscule, when we think of them in terms of the real people in africa, and what they’re trying to achieve. %$* 83
third, we see amazing successes each and every day, such as the eradication of measles, when practical strategies are set to achieve practical targets, no politics, just getting the job done. %$* 83
so it’s with these three points in mind that i urge the house to reject the simplistic and misleading proposition that aid to africa does more harm than good, and “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” more importantly, let’s join together to focus on the practical task of ensuring that aid builds on the successes, to keep doing as much good as it possibly can. %$* 83
thank you. %$* 83
i think—i’d like to make a few quick points, first on the trade just ‘cause that’s come up, i think it’s important to understand that if the so-called doha trade agreement comes through the estimates are that africa might benefit about a billion dollars per year. %$* 83
that’s mainly an issue of cotton exporters, it’s actually not an issue for many—most of the other commodities, and that’s a billion dollars which is quite small, when spread across 700 million people— %$* 83
i’m just saying that the, the trade is good, but it’s not huge in quantitative terms, to %$* 83
bill easterly i would say, i don’t know what you expect to buy for 30 bucks per person. %$* 83
you think—i say a, a million people, 1.3 million people on anti-retrovirals in five years and you say huh, old story. %$* 83
i say, 360,000 kids a year not dying, you say, huh, old story. %$* 83
i say 20 percentage point boost in primary enrollment in barely a decade, you say huh, old story. %$* 83
i really don’t know what you expect to buy for $30 per person. %$* 83
these are practical things, i’m not defending, as i said at the outset, everything that’s been done in aid policy, i’m not defending all of the machinery. %$* 83
professor easterly and i i think would agree on nine out of 10 issues, and we have in many instances on what needs to be done, to actually improve the aid system. %$* 83
is that harm or is that good? %$* 83
that’s $300 per capita, it’s 40 bucks— %$* 83
at this point in the debate i’m supposed to ask a few follow-up questions. %$* 79
so, william easterly, john mcarthur %$* 79
just listed some very specific examples of what he said are very significant successes, smallpox eradication, a million people on anti- retrovirals who have hiv, once thought impossible. %$* 79
the un and others cut measles deaths by 91 percent. %$* 79
what he said about malawi. %$* 79
are these not significant successes, when you said signif—si—wait—when you said success stories are rare? %$* 79
uh, well, one sign of the rarity of success stories is that i keep hearing the same ones over and over again. %$* 82
the, uh, the smallpox example is given, is given so often and it’s—it happened so long ago that, i think it should be consigned to, uh, to history at this point, uh %$* 82
i’m not—i don’t—i’m not going to say that everything fails, that there are no successes, small—smallpox was a success, uh %$* 82
but the fact that we keep citing the same thing over and over again suggests just how few successes there have been, the measles success, unfortunately was, until this new announcement was actually on the ledger side of failure. %$* 82
“aid to africa is doing more harm than good” uh, the measle—cheap and inexpensive measles vaccination had been available for decades, and yet had not—had not been used to save millions of lives from measles. %$* 82
so i’m not sure i would count that as much of a success at this point. %$* 82
but is the answer to that, given what has taken place, just to stop aid? %$* 79
no, i’m not %$* 82
i’m not sure that we’re voting tonight on whether to stop aid, i think we’re voting on whether the existing aid system has done more harm than good, the, uh, the existing aid system i think we’re arguing is ineffective, it’s—has bad political effects in propping up corrupt autocrats. %$* 82
and i think that system does more harm than good, uh, i, i could imagine other aid systems that would do some good, that could save lives. %$* 82
if aid agencies were held accountable for results, which they are not now. %$* 82
if they were held accountable for failure which they are not now. %$* 82
but we don’t have that system at the present, we’re voting on the system we have now and that’s the system that has failed us unfortunately. %$* 82
so, gayle smith, maybe there is a seed of common ground. %$* 79
maybe we each agree that the aid system that we have now is not the perfect aid system, that there are successes, that there are “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” failures, and there are things that perhaps all of you could agree on, to make things much better. %$* 79
might that be the case? %$* 79
well, i—i think aid systems can be, uh %$* 81
improved, no question, i think that one of the problems though with this argument is that it suggests that none of that is happening. %$* 81
i think there are other successes out there, uh, john didn’t mention, uh, hiv—or did mention, excuse me, hiv and aids which i think is significant and the fact that, success in measles is later than it should’ve been, uh— i—i don’t think therefore writes it off as a success, but i think we’ve also got a problem with terms here and i think this is a bit too important, uh, to be slipshod with. %$* 81
for example, when you talk about $600 billion in aid, that conflates development aid and a lot of aid that was given for reasons having nothing to do with development, let’s not pretend for a minute that the aid the united states gave to zaire during the cold war was given for development. %$* 81
everybody knows it wasn’t, so to hold it accountable for achieving development aims, i think is— %$* 81
and the u—us has no— %$* 82
—let me finish, please let me finish— “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” %$* 81
—strategic motives, at all now—? %$* 82
please let me finish. %$* 81
my point is, that that aid was not given for development purposes, and you are judging it on the basis of whether or not it achieved development purposes. %$* 81
i suspect we would agree that the purposes for which it was given, were not very good. %$* 81
but i don’t think it’s, it’s right to suggest that money that’s given for security reasons should be held to development outcomes, second, i—i think you’re suggesting that the fact that poverty still exists in epidemic proportions in africa, is because of aid. %$* 81
what about the terms of trade. %$* 81
what about commodity prices. %$* 81
what about war. %$* 81
what about drought. %$* 81
what about governments that may be %$* 81
ineffective. %$* 81
what about colonialism and the cold war, i think the notion that the fact that poverty still exists in africa because of aid, is way oversimplified, last, i— i— or, excuse me, that, that two-thirds of aid goes to corrupt rulers. %$* 81
the example i used of the commodity exchange in ethiopia, is not aid to the government of ethiopia, it’s a private- sector initiative. %$* 81
so i—i think you need to be careful about suggesting %$* 81
that two-thirds of aid goes to corrupt rulers, that’s not in fact the case today— %$* 81
two-thirds of official aid. %$* 82
“aid to africa is doing more harm than good” and la—no, that’s not true of official aid, an increasing amount of official aid goes to non-government entities and private-sector groups, lastly, i think there’s a contradiction here that we may wanna tease out. %$* 81
i—i think i heard david say that aid is flawed because it’s designed to develop people from afar. %$* 81
but bill’s arguing that aid is flawed, because it has not developed people from afar. %$* 81
and i think there’s a contradiction there. %$* 81
it’s, it’s wrong because it aims to develop other people, which, i mean i would actually agree with david that that’s not something we can do. %$* 81
but bill, it seems to me you’re suggesting that it’s wrong because it has failed to do just that. %$* 81
david rieff, if i heard you correctly you said, that %$* 79
it never can be different. %$* 79
i think i heard from william easterly, that it could be different if there were a better aid system. %$* 79
do you think the whole notion of aid to africa as a means of improving standards of living, is an impossible notion? %$* 79
well, what i think is impossible is the notion of aid as the centerpiece of development, uh, in africa, that’s—that—i mean my view, for what it’s worth, is simply that, the whole system of international development is structured around various modalities of aid. %$* 80
that’s why i brought up the trade issue which “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” i insist is a real issue despite what mr. %$* 80
mcarthur said, because the terms of trade are stacked against africa. %$* 80
to use only one example, they’re not only stacked against africa, they’re stacked against other parts of the world as well. %$* 80
but, you know, to put it, you know, very bluntly that, you know, that, this is a—the system of trade at the moment, is in an age of rising commodity prices, nonetheless, uh, structured so that the actual producers of commodities get screwed by the, by the system, the international system of trade. %$* 80
so, my view is simply that, by making development aid from the outside, whether it’s national governments, or inter-governmental institutions, the centerpiece of what you’re doing means it’s always going to fail. %$* 80
and i think that we’re— the thing that troubles me about the, if you like, the, the—those arguing against this motion is false—i, i, i mean obviously, somebody who grew up—i grew up in the ‘60s, and i remember leftists of my type, uh, saying at the time, well, of course the soviet union’s no good and cuba’s no good and %$* 80
china’s no good and korea’s no good and %$* 80
albania’s obviously no good. %$* 80
but that’s actually existing communism. %$* 80
what there is, there’s this wonderful communism that we could somehow create. %$* 80
and i think the lesson, this is a point made by the critic of development, colin leys, in his famous book, that at a certain point you have to say, you had to say, even if you remain—if you were on the left, and i remain on the left, uh, i wanna be clear “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” about that, uh— in this call above all others. %$* 80
um, but, uh %$* 80
but the, at a certain point, people on the left had to admit that this was a lie. %$* 80
that there was not actually existing communism and ideal communism, the—what actually existed was communism. %$* 80
period. %$* 80
that’s— %$* 80
john— john mcarthur, um, briefly and then we’re gonna continue with the, the opening remarks of the panelists who haven’t spoken yet. %$* 79
do the successes that you listed %$* 79
equate, really, to significant successes, or exceptions as william easterly contends, if some of his other stats are true and two-thirds of aid is gobbled up by corrupt, uh, dictators, and $600 billion spent, and more or less the standard of living on the continent has not gone up. %$* 79
i think—i’d like to make a few quick points, first on the trade just ‘cause that’s come up, i think it’s important to understand that if the so-called doha trade agreement comes through the estimates are that africa might benefit about a billion dollars per year. %$* 83
that’s mainly an issue of cotton exporters, it’s actually not an issue for many—most of the other commodities, and that’s a billion dollars which is quite small, when spread across 700 million people— %$* 83
“aid to africa is doing more harm than good” but wait a minute, david rieff, is that aid, or is that something else, trade? %$* 79
well, the disagreement is, if you’re saying that— my emphasis on trade, john, is not the doha round, i mean if, if you’re, if—we agree about the doha round. %$* 80
i’m just saying that the, the trade is good, but it’s not huge in quantitative terms, to %$* 83
bill easterly i would say, i don’t know what you expect to buy for 30 bucks per person. %$* 83
you think—i say a, a million people, 1.3 million people on anti-retrovirals in five years and you say huh, old story. %$* 83
i say, 360,000 kids a year not dying, you say, huh, old story. %$* 83
i say 20 percentage point boost in primary enrollment in barely a decade, you say huh, old story. %$* 83
i really don’t know what you expect to buy for $30 per person. %$* 83
these are practical things, i’m not defending, as i said at the outset, everything that’s been done in aid policy, i’m not defending all of the machinery. %$* 83
professor easterly and i i think would agree on nine out of 10 issues, and we have in many instances on what needs to be done, to actually improve the aid system. %$* 83
professor easterly, the one million people on aids anti- “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” retrovirals, no big deal? %$* 79
no, of course, it’s prolonging their lives, that’s great, i salute that, uh, but, let’s— %$* 82
is that harm or is that good? %$* 83
that’s good. %$* 82
but let’s, let’s be clear about these—let’s be clear about these numbers, for many african countries, aid is 20 percent of their gdp. if they had invested that— %$* 82
that’s $300 per capita, it’s 40 bucks— %$* 83
if they had invested that, then the ex— expectation of the aid advocates was that they would’ve had economic growth. %$* 82
and that simply is what did not happen. %$* 82
it did— it did not get invested, we did not have growth. %$* 82
now, part two of the opening statements. %$* 79
back to the hard part, let’s see if i can keep figuring out the order here. %$* 79
george ayittey, it’s your turn for opening remarks. %$* 79
hello, well first of all, uh, let me thank the intelligence squared, uh, for having this debate. %$* 84
and, i personally as an african, i find “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” this very amusing that i can see proponents for and against, uh, aid. %$* 84
and i think— those of us on this side, really believe that, you have to separate the humanitarian impulse, from the record of aid itself. %$* 84
i mean on the humanitarian impulse, we all wanna help, as a matter of fact, a lot of people here say that it is the moral obligation of the rich to help the poor. %$* 84
but the record on aid has been a disaster. %$* 84
and that’s what a lot of us do, of us on this particular side of the table, want to change. %$* 84
and what we’re saying is that, look, the current system of aid harms africa. %$* 84
and i think john mcarthur said that, no, uh, there, there, there are a new group of people %$* 84
he calls them the cheetahs, i disagree. %$* 84
and, uh, he believes that, aid can be reformed and help the african people. %$* 84
but %$* 84
fact of the matter is, more than 600 billion has been poured into africa since 1960, with nothing to show for it. %$* 84
except the marketing of black elephants and crumbled infrastructure and decaying buildings. %$* 84
there are a couple of misconceptions about aid that we need to clear up. %$* 84
first of all, aid—foreign aid is not free. %$* 84
it is a very soft loan. %$* 84
which is given to a government. %$* 84
on—at concessional rates. %$* 84
now the second thing about aid is that, aid is tied. %$* 84
80 percent of us aid to africa is spent right here in—in america. %$* 84
on american contractors, american suppliers, and so forth. %$* 84
french aid is even worse. %$* 84
when china gives you aid they don’t just send you materials, they also bring in the labor, and, and, uh, materials “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” and, you know, set up towns for their workers for example. %$* 84
now %$* 84
one of the things which has been missing in this piece, is that, nobody asked %$* 84
whom at all do we want to help in africa, nobody asked that question. %$* 84
it is assumed, that if we give aid—if we gave aid to africa, automatically, it will help, lift the people out of poverty. %$* 84
and this is one of the reasons, it’s one of the fallacies of aid. %$* 84
it’s one of the reasons why it’s so difficult to come up with success stories, of aid in africa. %$* 84
we can find countries, that the us aid has been able to reform politically, we can’t find countries where us aid has been able to reform politi—economically. %$* 84
right now as we speak %$* 84
out of the 54 african countries, only 16 of them are democratic. %$* 84
less than 10 can be characterized as economic success stories. %$* 84
forget about intellectual freedom. %$* 84
that is in the stalinist era. %$* 84
what africa needs, and as a matter of fact i testified before the senate of canada this past june. %$* 84
and what i laid before them, yes, they want to help africa. %$* 84
but they themselves, came up with a report, canadian report, senate report, of 40 years of canadian aid failure in africa. %$* 84
what to do. %$* 84
now we’re not suggesting, now don’t help africa. %$* 84
but if you want to help africa, folks, please, for pete’s sake, ask the africans what they want. %$* 84
don’t assume that you know better than the africans. %$* 84
what africans want, three things, reform, reform, reform. %$* 84
reform the abominable political systems, reform the abominable economic systems, and intellectual systems, give africans the “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” freedom, so that they themselves can decide what is good for them. %$* 84
such freedoms are lacking in africa. %$* 84
so to me, this debate really %$* 84
is, currently, the aid system is rotten, it’s not helping the african people. %$* 84
and if you want to help the african people, what i’ll propose to you, and this is what our side is coming up with, is smart aid. %$* 84
smart aid is that which empowers the african people to instigate reform from within. %$* 84
the ruling elites are not interested in reform. %$* 84
we all know what the problems are, bloated bureaucracies. %$* 84
corruption! %$* 84
we want to trim government expenditures in africa. %$* 84
the elites are not interested, you ask them %$* 84
to cut government spending. %$* 84
and they will set up a ministry of less government spending. %$* 84
now this is the hippo generation, they are not interested in reform. %$* 84
you ask them %$* 84
to curb corruption, and like in kenya, they’ll set up an anti-corruption commission. %$* 84
but then, when it snakes too close, they sack the, uh, corruption czar, and shut the whole thing down. %$* 84
africans know what they want. %$* 84
and if you want to better help the african people, ask them. %$* 84
thank you. %$* 84
c. payne lucas, your opening remarks. %$* 79
good evening. %$* 85
for a moment, i thought george was describing “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” america. %$* 85
you know, i come from washington d.c.where last week, week before last, $40 million was stolen by some employees inside the government. %$* 85
and when bill talked about 600 billion, i thought about how much of the six—how much money do we spend in iraq and afghanistan every month. %$* 85
i mean i %$* 85
i’m, i’m stunned, that we are suggesting that all we need to do, is get the bags of money, take ‘em to africa, give ‘em to the africans, and let them decide and bypass the government. %$* 85
well let me tell you something this evening, i don’t care how you vote, that’s not going to happen. %$* 85
‘cause we want to know, what’s happening to our money. %$* 85
everything is changing. %$* 85
that’s one thing about aid, it’s always changing. %$* 85
let me say one thing. %$* 85
sese seko mobutu. %$* 85
every time we talk about corruption, we talk about mr. %$* 85
mobutu, who stole millions of dollars in the congo. %$* 85
well, why shouldn’t he have stolen them. %$* 85
we were in the congo to start with to stop communism. %$* 85
not to help the poor people of the congo. %$* 85
we were not there for that purpose. %$* 85
we know that. %$* 85
we wanted the congo’s precious metals, and we wanted to keep the russians. %$* 85
so he is mr. %$* 85
corruption. %$* 85
and if i gave a test tonight to the people in this room, of how many corrupt politicians or corrupt states in africa, not very many people here would pass, i didn’t know we had so many countries doing so well until mr. %$* 85
ayittey’d spoken. %$* 85
we got 16 countries, got 18 countries—doing well. %$* 85
that is an enormous track record. %$* 85
“aid to africa is doing more harm than good” now for every mobutu, that you have in africa, you have some non-bu—mobutus. %$* 85
i wish for example, that president mandela could’ve been here tonight, to have heard these remarks. %$* 85
he would’ve grabbed some of the people by their throat and said, what do you mean! %$* 85
we know people who’ve attacked bono for %$* 85
for his notion that we ought to be digging wells all over africa. %$* 85
that people walk two and three miles a day in search of water, not in search of water, in search of bad water. %$* 85
we need all the help we can get, why do we turn to america, because we are a generous nation. %$* 85
we know president bush said when he was in the campaign the last time, he said, we’re not going to engage in nation-building. %$* 85
we’re gonna let the people do their own thing. %$* 85
but when we got to %$* 85
iraq, we found out, we’d better start doing some nation-building. %$* 85
and on the one day we hated the un and the next day we were begging undp to come and help us solve the problems %$* 85
in iraq. %$* 85
one of the reasons that we have to help africa, and i know we discounted all these programs we had over the years, small pox, we discounted onchocerciasis, thousands and thousands of africa, africans involved in river blindness, we found a cure for it, working with the private sector, and working with aid.so, millions of acres, acres of land have been liberated because we solved this disease. %$* 85
so, let me just say, for every corrupt politician in africa, we have a history of some great politicians in africa. %$* 85
there was a man who headed up a country “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” by the name of tanzania, his name was nyerere. %$* 85
i can't recall the new president of tanzania, but we’re talking about his work in tanzania, and how this country is moving forward. %$* 85
we had a place called liberia, and for use we propped up tubman in liberia, and people said, when is it going to change? %$* 85
one thing about africa, it is capable of change, and that’s what we’re working with. %$* 85
we now have a woman in liberia by the name of johnson sirleaf, who walked into a living hell, and now is going to build a nation state. %$* 85
she will not be able to build it without the help of the american community and the development community. %$* 85
we have a chance to do something in liberia, one of our own quote, unquote, colonies. %$* 85
why do we do it, why do we work with americans, why do we do things in africa, because we know how to get things done. %$* 85
sometime we start out the wrong way, but almost invariably at the end of the day we end up in the right way. %$* 85
then they say, well you know, we can't find the, we can't find any good politicians in africa. %$* 85
in mozambique there was a man by the name of joaquim chissano. %$* 85
this year he was voted five million dollar peace prize for the way he ran his country with good governance. %$* 85
i remember when people were giving him hell, but he said, wait, i’ll prove to you that we can run this country and bring help to the people of this country. %$* 85
so he got a five million dollar prize for doing things right. %$* 85
we also know about our president in mali, who’s doing a great job in mali. %$* 85
“aid to africa is doing more harm than good” these things don’t just happen. %$* 85
our ambassadors and our aid agencies, they work night and day trying to make all these things happen. %$* 85
this is a complicated world we live in. %$* 85
africa got fifty- three countries, eight hundred million people, and by the way, don’t discount colonialism, don’t say that we want to go back to the old days when africa had free trade, and everything was wonderful. %$* 85
in the old days everything was not wonderful. %$* 85
in the old days people were sick and often they did not know it. %$* 85
and then some people make the arguments that, why are we involved in anti-retrovirals? %$* 85
we should have a program of treatment, of, of prevention. %$* 85
sure we should have a program of prevention. %$* 85
but if your family, they have hiv/aids they want some of that anti- retroviral. %$* 85
so we gotta do that. %$* 85
and what we are saying here tonight, we have to change all the things that we say. %$* 85
no, aid is not right, but we have an opportunity to change it. %$* 85
one thing we have learned over the years, our programs must be owned by africans, they must be african led, they must be sustainable, and they must be accountable. %$* 85
in the age of technology, we don’t need to wait two years to find a crook in africa, our computers can find them almost overnight. %$* 85
so when we apply the technology, we can identify the crooks. %$* 85
“aid to africa is doing more harm than good” and let me tell you something else, 9/11 will be coming back unless we respond sooner than later, and if we don’t respond to africa and their needs, the chinese will, because the chinese are coming, and they don’t ask questions about democracy, and good governance, and freedom of the press, and justice, they just want the raw materials. %$* 85
one minute. %$* 79
in the age of technology, we don’t need to wait two years to find a crook in africa, our computers can find them almost overnight. %$* 85
so when we apply the technology, we can identify the crooks. %$* 85
“aid to africa is doing more harm than good” and let me tell you something else, 9/11 will be coming back unless we respond sooner than later, and if we don’t respond to africa and their needs, the chinese will, because the chinese are coming, and they don’t ask questions about democracy, and good governance, and freedom of the press, and justice, they just want the raw materials. %$* 85
c. payne lucas, in telling the story of the thievery of government money in the united states at the beginning, did you mean to suggest that corruption in the united states is the equivalent of the corruption in much of africa? %$* 79
and by saying for every mobutu you also have more great politicians, do you mean to differ greatly from george ayittey’s estimate that of the fifty-four countries in africa, only sixteen of them are democracies, i hope i got those numbers right %$* 79
no, i don’t, i mean, i was surprised that we have sixteen democracies in africa. %$* 85
i don’t think nigeria was exactly a democracy under president obarsaso obasanjo, but i have to really give him a great deal of respect for the fact that he managed a nation of a hundred and fifty million people without any great fall down of war and decadence. %$* 85
and on top of that, he appointed a woman by the name of minister ngozi, who went out “aid to africa is doing more harm than good” and looked for corruption. %$* 85
so when you start to think like that and change like that, the message is getting through. %$* 85
you don't ignore nigeria. %$* 85
and when you start to talk about aid, let’s not forget, when you talk about six hundred billion dollars of that, how much of that went to egypt and israel. %$* 85
we have, we have to support those places because we have strategic interests in those places. %$* 85
and sometime aid itself is, is not related, it’s related to maintaining our relationships so those cannot be ignored. %$* 85
george ayittey, you said that africans want three things, reform, reform, and reform. %$* 79
economic reform, political reform, and intellectual reform. %$* 79
do the united states or the united nations have a role to play in that, in your opinion? %$* 79
well, first of all, let me address some of the comments made by c.payne lucas. %$* 84
and that is, look, take nigeria, for example, please do not minimize the issue of corruption. %$* 84

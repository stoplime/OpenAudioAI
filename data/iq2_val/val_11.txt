welcome, and thank you all for coming. %$* 1
about a year ago, we did a debate, the resolution was that global warming is not a crisis. %$* 1
and the audience in that debate started voting 57 percent against the resolution, ended up only 42 percent were against the resolution. %$* 1
it was the biggest change in opinion that i think we’ve had in any debate that we’ve done, and it was perhaps the most newsworthy debate that we’ve ever presented. %$* 1
well this debate takes off from where that one left off. %$* 1
it assumes that global warming is real. %$* 1
it assumes that human activity, particularly emissions of carbon, make a major contribution. %$* 1
the resolution today is about major cuts in carbon emissions and i in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) want to emphasize major. %$* 1
if firms or universities or governmental entities find a cost-effective way of reducing their carbon footprint, that’s a cause for applause and not debate. %$* 1
but the major issue, is really burning coal to generate electricity. %$* 1
in china and in india, there are going be 800 new coal-fired plants to generate electricity, in the next five years. %$* 1
those plants alone will emit five times as much carbon as the entire savings from kyoto i accords. %$* 1
well, there’s a kyoto ii framework under discussion, and it is far more ambitious. %$* 1
it proposes to tax the release of greenhouse gases, through a cap-and-trade mechanism, by $1.3 trillion annually. %$* 1
this is staggering, 10 percent of the us gross domestic product, 2 percent of world gnp.one can’t contemplate an intervention of this magnitude, without asking a couple of questions. %$* 1
first of all, what are the benefits that are associated with costs this large. %$* 1
and secondly, what alternative expenditures might enhance human welfare more. %$* 1
it’s these questions that our panelists tonight are going to address. %$* 1
and now it’s my pleasure to hand the evening back to john donvan and the outstanding group of panelists that we’ve assembled this evening. %$* 1
thank you, robert. %$* 13
and may i just invite in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) another round of applause for robert rosenkranz, for making all of these debates possible. %$* 13
welcome to the symphony space in new york city, i’m john donvan, your host and moderator for this intelligence squared us debate, another in a series of, we hope smart and scintillating programs, debating topics that matter. %$* 13
the motion before us, this time, “major reductions in carbon emissions are not worth the money.” this is a contest, it’s a contest of logic and wit, and mostly persuasion, these panelists are here to change your minds, you the audience are the judges. %$* 13
now, to introduce our panelists. %$* 13
first, peter huber, author of the bottomless well, and a columnist for forbes. %$* 13
bjorn lomborg, founder of the copenhagen consensus. %$* 13
philip stott, emeritus professor and biogeographer from the university of london. %$* 13
this is the team arguing for the motion. %$* 13
arguing against the motion, hunter lovins, president of natural capitalism solutions %$* 13
oliver tickell, a journalist and author of the kyoto ii climate initiative %$* 13
and adam werbach, global ceo of sacchi and sacchi s.the intelligence squared and intelligence squared us debate series are produced by the rosenkranz foundation. %$* 13
shortly, you will hear from our six panelists, three for the motion and three in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) against the motion. %$* 13
the motion is, “major reductions in carbon emissions are not worth the money.” now we want to ask you at this point to register your views on this motion as you come in off the street, before hearing any of the argument, because as i say, they are here to persuade you and to change your minds. %$* 13
you can reach now for those keypads, and i’ll remind you particularly if you came in late, the way to vote if you agree with the motion, that “major reductions in carbon emissions are not worth the money,” push number 1.if you disagree push number 2, if you are undecided push number 3.if you regret your decision, you can correct it by pushing the correct button, and it will register the last entry. %$* 13
does anybody need more time? %$* 13
all right, so what we’re going to do is tabulate those and a little bit later in the evening, i will share the results of that polling. %$* 13
the panelists will each be given seven minutes to speak. %$* 13
if they reach the seven-minute mark and are still going i’ll have to step in, after that, we’ll be hearing from you in the audience and following that section and that’s normally the longest section, each panelist will be given two minutes to summarize their views, and then, we will vote again, and find out who the winner is. %$* 13
and i want to make clear %$* 13
the way that we determine a winner, is to see, who was more persuasive in changing minds, in other in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) words if somebody starts with a 60 percent margin, and the other team obviously has 40 percent, whoever moves their percentage higher will actually be declared the, the winner of the evening. %$* 13
that’s clear to everybody? %$* 13
yeah, okay. %$* 13
so, let’s let the debate begin. %$* 13
our motion is, “major reductions in carbon emissions are not worth the money,” and arguing first for the motion, bjorn lomborg, he is from denmark, the land that has led the globe in the development of wind power, it is an environmentalist’s dreamland. %$* 13
but he is an environmentalist skeptic in many ways, and is first to argue for the motion. %$* 13
bjorn lomborg. %$* 13
i’ll speak for the motion that “major reductions in carbon emissions are not worth the money.” perhaps a natural reaction to that would be, what, are there still people who think it’s more important to save money, than to save the world? %$* 99
that’s not our point. %$* 99
our point is, that we should really save the world, not just feel like we’re saving it. %$* 99
let’s be clear—global warming is real. %$* 99
man-made, and increases by carbon emissions. %$* 99
and global warming will harm future generations, especially the world’s poor. %$* 99
but the brutal fact is, that even major carbon cuts at dramatic cost will make little impact on temperature, and do virtually nothing to help the world. %$* 99
still, my honored opponents will spend hundreds or even thousands of billions of dollars, to in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) slightly reduce the impact of climate change 100 years from now, yet more than half the world’s population suffers from medieval problems that we could fix right now, at much lower cost. %$* 99
this is nothing less than a moral tragedy for the developed world. %$* 99
knowingly squandering colossal sums of money, achieving almost nothing, while fractional sums could save millions of lives right now. %$* 99
obvious as it may sound, our goal isn’t for those of us in wealthy western world to feel good about ourselves, presumably, it’s about making sure we do the most good. %$* 99
today, 1 billion lack clean drinking water, 2 billion people lack sanitation, 3 billion people lack simple micronutrients, preventing physical and mental development. %$* 99
one quarter of all the world’s deaths, are due to easily curable infectious diseases. %$* 99
the equivalent of the population of florida, wiped off the map, each year. %$* 99
as an example, 1 million people die from malaria each year, and up to 2 billion people get the debilitating disease. %$* 99
yet, my esteemed opponents will focus on how global warming will cause a slight increase in malaria increase 100 years from now, and suggest that we should fix that through inefficient carbon cuts. %$* 99
but we could eradicate malaria right now, if we wanted, and at a lot lower cost. %$* 99
that is the moral choice. %$* 99
this pattern of little good at high cost, we find repeated in the cases by opponents will in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) present to you. %$* 99
and this is why all peer-reviewed economic valises show that simply cutting carbon is a poor way to help the world. %$* 99
and that’s exactly the crux of tonight’s debate. %$* 99
that the best available economic evidence tells us that by focusing on cutting carbon emissions, we’re committing to an exceptionally inefficient way to tackle the symptoms of global warming, let alone global warming itself. %$* 99
and given how much of our resources will be squandered in the process, the consequences are nothing less than a moral tragedy. %$* 99
of course, my esteemed opponents will claim that without major carbon cuts, the world will be beyond saving. %$* 99
oliver tickell has written that unabated global warming by the end of the century will be a catastrophe, and the beginning of the extinction of the human race because all the ice will melt and we’ll see 200 feet of sea-level rise in the long term, wiping out pretty much everyone we hold dear, killing billions of people. %$* 99
this doom-mongering is simply wrong. %$* 99
it’s inconsistent with everything we know. %$* 99
and it’s important that people everywhere start to realize this. %$* 99
we’ve entrusted the un climate panel, the so-called ipcc, with its thousands of scientists, to outline the most likely climate consequences. %$* 99
they do not support tickell, or any of the other, more alarmist writings of recent times. %$* 99
what the ipcc does tell us is, yes, sea levels will rise, somewhere between six and 24 in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) inches over the coming century. %$* 99
such a rise is entirely manageable, and not dissimilar to the about 12 inches we barely noticed, have risen over the last 150 years. %$* 99
dramatic, expensive carbon cuts would make sea-level rise just a few inches less in 100 years. %$* 99
is this really the best we can do to help the world? %$* 99
of course, the obvious and easy thing to say is, well, we should do all good things, we should both make major carbon reductions, and combat malaria. %$* 99
but this simply ignores the fact that we aren’t doing either very well. %$* 99
we avoid the hard truth that the rich world’s focus is shifting daily towards global warming, with proportional less support seen for the real, and more tractable problems. %$* 99
it’s simply untruthful to claim that the focus on climate change doesn’t mean there’s less money going elsewhere. %$* 99
the global fund to fight aids, tuberculosis and malaria, is telling us that billions of dollars are being redirected to the fight, global warming, at the expense of the biggest killers of the poor countries. %$* 99
any company or organization today that wants to be responsible, even just cool, will not be spending their cash on fighting tuberculosis, but wants to go carbon-neutral. %$* 99
we must save the world, yes. %$* 99
and here’s how. %$* 99
at the copenhagen consensus project last year, a panel of the world’s most distinguished in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) economists looked at a wealth of research of all the major problems in the world, and the possible solutions to them. %$* 99
and they showed us where we can do the most good. %$* 99
they agreed that global warming’s real, and they were unanimous that the best way to tackle it is by investing much more in research and development in low carbon energy technologies. %$* 99
the economists also found that carbon emission cuts, tonight’s motion, would be the poorest use of our money. %$* 99
they confirmed that we can do so much more good elsewhere, that we need to ease our preoccupation with cutting carbon, and focusing much more on fixing the real problems of the here and now. %$* 99
this is about saving everyone’s world. %$* 99
not through ineffective and hugely costly carbon cuts, but through effective research and development, and low carbon energy sources, that anyway, will be the only long-term solution to the co2 problem. %$* 99
and then remembering the major problems and challenges of this world. %$* 99
every single year and right now, a devastation is taking place in our world. %$* 99
a dumb, readily avoidable devastation. %$* 99
continuing mindlessly, and spending hundreds of billions of dollars in carbon cuts, is simply disgraceful, when it takes so little to do something about this devastation. %$* 99
so, this is our chance. %$* 99
our chance not just to feel good about helping the planet, but actually to do the right thing, the rational thing, and in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) the morally correct thing. %$* 99
i commend this motion to you, do what’s rational, not just what’s fashionable. %$* 99
thank you. %$* 99
thank you, bjorn lomborg. %$* 13
and worth waiting for. %$* 13
our next speaker, oliver tickell, has had actually something of an intellectual feud with bjorn in the pages of the guardian, in london, back and forth, but oliver himself is from britain %$* 13
has come up with— if kyoto was the treaty that was supposed to slow the growth of greenhouse gases, it has failed and oliver tickell has come up with kyoto ii, an environmental blueprint. %$* 13
environment is his passion and he is next arguing against the motion, ladies and gentlemen, oliver tickell. %$* 13
i would prefer not to see this as any kind of feud, i think it’s a debate and it’s a debate which i’m very pleased to be able to pursue here, with all of you. %$* 100
bjorn did an excellent presentation, and he made very effective use of the particular rhetorical flourish which i would call the false choice, or the false dichotomy. %$* 100
either we address the problem of global warming, or we address the problems of malaria, water provision, and malnutrition. %$* 100
but this is a false choice, no one’s saying that we’ve got to do one or other, we can do both. %$* 100
it is no more real a in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) choice than that between tackling global warming and eating pizza. %$* 100
you know, we can do both. %$* 100
in fact, if we tackle the problems of global warming in an effective way, it will directly help with the provision of water. %$* 100
one of the major problems of global warming is the loss of rainfall, shifting patterns of rainfall, melting of glaciers that feed hundreds of millions of people worldwide. %$* 100
so, failing to deal with global warming is a huge step back on that fight, likewise with malaria, and other insect-borne disease, as temperatures rise, so these diseases will spread and become more prevalent, and hold back development further. %$* 100
now. %$* 100
the core point though, bjorn very kindly began to make it for me. %$* 100
it is that the consequences of not dealing with global warming are potentially catastrophic. %$* 100
and, he said this is inconsistent with everything we know. %$* 100
well, that’s wrong. %$* 100
what we do know, is that 55 million years ago, at a time called the paleocene-eocene thermal maximum, temperatures were ten degrees warmer than they are now. %$* 100
carbon dioxide levels were approximately one thousand parts a million-- %$* 100
very high levels. %$* 100
and sea levels were approximately two hundred and fifty feet higher. %$* 100
now, we have been there before. %$* 100
we can go there again. %$* 100
there is no law that says that we cannot revert to that state of fifty-five million years ago. %$* 100
there is no certainty that that will happen. %$* 100
it might happen or it might not. %$* 100
climate is extremely in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) complex. %$* 100
there are many, many feedbacks of frankly, breathtaking intricacy and complexity, which we haven’t even begun to fathom. %$* 100
and for that reason, i find bjorn’s certainty that this will not take place completely incomprehensible. %$* 100
there is no certainty in this. %$* 100
the only certainty is once it’s already happened. %$* 100
and given those uncertainties, our overwhelming priority must be to make sure that it does not happen. %$* 100
it is hard even to put a probability on it, but the facts are that climate, the climate system is characterized by feedbacks, including some very powerful positive feedbacks, even with the one degree. %$* 100
in fact, under one degree of temperature rise that we’ve had so far, these feedbacks are kicking into effect. %$* 100
these include the melting of arctic sea ice which causes the sun’s rays to be absorbed, raising temperatures at the poles. %$* 100
it includes the reduced absorption of carbon dioxide into oceans. %$* 100
there were results in the newspaper yesterday from the sea of japan where the absorption of carbon dioxide is halved. %$* 100
we see that the forests of canada, which had been considered a major net carbon sink, are now becoming a net source of carbon as a result of insect depredations caused by higher temperatures. %$* 100
so, positive feedback process are already taking place as temperatures continue to rise further. %$* 100
further positive feedbacks in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) can swing into effect and we could indeed find ourselves propelled through the uncontrolled emissions of methane, from example, from peat bogs and swamps. %$* 100
we could find that we well and truly lose control of climate, that positive feedbacks take over from everything that we are doing ourselves. %$* 100
and that is where we must not go. %$* 100
and yes, there are costs. %$* 100
to avoid this you have to spend money. %$* 100
but there are many other cases in which we spend money to avoid potentially catastrophic risks, even if we perceive those risks as being improbable – such as insurance against a car crash or a house fire, where the costs are potentially huge, even if the probability is low. %$* 100
in this particular case, of course, we have to be mindful of the cost. %$* 100
we don’t just want to throw unlimited amounts of money at this problem. %$* 100
but if we look at the amounts of money, i mean, my cost – and which includes not only mitigation but also substantial funding for adaptation, which is already taking place – is about one trillion dollars per year. %$* 100
and that is, roughly the same as what the world spends on weaponry and the military sector. %$* 100
so if we can afford to spend that on weapons, why can’t we afford to spend it to prevent this potentially ruinous catastrophe that could come upon us. %$* 100
but i will go a stage further. %$* 100
i will say that much of this isn’t really cost at all. %$* 100
it is investment. %$* 100
because we need ultimately to in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) move away from fossil fuels anyway. %$* 100
if we move away from fossil fuels sooner, before we have to – because they run out – that actually saves enormous economic cost. %$* 100
it saves the economic cost of a hundred and fifty dollar a barrel petrol, oil. %$* 100
and that is something that has caused america and other countries huge hardships. %$* 100
we can create new industries. %$* 100
we have huge idle work forces. %$* 100
we have huge idle productive capacity in industries that can be put back to work building us a future free of fossil fuels. %$* 100
the world at the moment is ravaged by conflict, much of that conflict over access to fossil fuels. %$* 100
if we move to a fossil fuel-free future, then much of that expenditure will vanish. %$* 100
but not only that expenditure, but all of the suffering, all of the tragedy that is associated with it. %$* 100
so in answer to the question, the motion, is it worth the money to make these major reductions in carbon dioxide emissions? %$* 100
, the only possible answer is, yes, and do it now. %$* 100
thank you, oliver tickell. %$* 13
our motion is: major reductions in carbon emissions are not worth the money. %$* 13
and now arguing for the motion, peter huber, an author who publishes here in the united states, books with titles like the bottomless well. %$* 13
but i like to look at the subtitles that tell us really what he thinks. %$* 13
one of his books was subtitled: saving the environment from the in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) environmentalists; another, why we will never run out of energy. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, peter huber. %$* 13
well, while he was running, barack obama was heard to say that he would bankrupt our coal industry. %$* 101
now, i don’t doubt washington’s ability to bankrupt almost anything in the united states. %$* 101
but, but china is currently adding a hundred gigs of coal electricity a year. %$* 101
that’s one entire united states worth of coal consumption every three years. %$* 101
there is no end in sight and there are other countries, all across the globe, following exactly in its footsteps. %$* 101
so let me say here quickly, where i end up and then try and tell you how i get there. %$* 101
we rich people of the planet can’t stop the other five billion poor people from burning a couple of trillion tons of carbon that they have within easy reach. %$* 101
we can’t even make any real dent in global emissions because the emissions are growing too fast, they involve too much involvement by very poor people who can’t easily change their ways and because those poor people are part of the same global economy as us.and if we are foolish enough, which we could well be, we will let carbon worries send our jobs to their shores and they will grow even faster and carbon emissions will grow faster still. %$* 101
it should go without saying, we don’t control global supply of carbon. %$* 101
ten countries ruled by in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) thoroughly nasty people control eighty per cent of the world’s oil, a trillion barrels currently worth fifty trillion dollars at current market prices. %$* 101
now, if i told you that there was that value in gold where it actually is, where the oil actually is, you would scoff at any suggestion that anything we could do, no matter what we spent, could force those people to keep that oil in the ground. %$* 101
it’s all they’ve got. %$* 101
they will drill it. %$* 101
they will pump it. %$* 101
they will find a market and somebody will burn it. %$* 101
poor countries all around this planet are sitting on a trillion tons of readily accessible coal. %$* 101
it’s all they’ve got for energy beyond the other great carbon reservoir of the planet, which is the rain forests and the soils, which they also, by and large, control. %$* 101
they will squeeze the carbon they can out of cheap coal, cheap forests and cheap soil, because that’s what’s there, unless they can get something even cheaper than that. %$* 101
and that, as i shall discuss shortly, is going to take some doing. %$* 101
we no longer control demand for carbon, either. %$* 101
the five billion poor people are already the main problem – not us. %$* 101
if you have heard otherwise, you have heard wrong. %$* 101
collectively, the poor already emit twenty per cent more greenhouse gas than we do. %$* 101
we burn a lot more carbon individually, of course, but they have in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) a lot more children. %$* 101
their fecundity has beaten out our gluttony and the gap is now widening very fast. %$* 101
china, not the united states, is now the largest emitter of greenhouse gas on the planet and it will soon be joined by others. %$* 101
it’s only a matter of time. %$* 101
and finally, the poor countries have made perfectly clear that they are not interested at all in spending what a low carb diet would cost. %$* 101
they have more pressing problems. %$* 101
so it really does come down to this. %$* 101
first, can we give the world something cheaper than carbon? %$* 101
the moon shot law of economics says, why, yes, we can. %$* 101
if we just really put our minds to it, it will happen-- %$* 101
atom bomb, moon landing, energy, you name it. %$* 101
no, not this time. %$* 101
fossil fuels are very cheap because they concentrate a lot of energy in a small space. %$* 101
you find a mountain of coal and you can just shovel gargantuan amounts of energy into the boxcars. %$* 101
renewable fuels like sun and wind are much harder. %$* 101
windmills are now fifty story skyscrapers, yet one windmill generates a piddling two megawatts. %$* 101
a jumbo needs a hundred megawatts to get off the ground. %$* 101
google is building hundred megawatt servers just to move bits around. %$* 101
meeting new york city’s total energy demand would require something like thirteen thousand windmills spinning at full speed or more like fifty thousand windmills scattered all over the state because you’ve gotta have enough of in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) them to be sure enough of them are in the windy spots. %$* 101
what was your mayor thinking when he suggested that you might just tuck them into manhattan? %$* 101
i mean, that kind of thinking betrays a very common view that, in fact, it betrays a profound ignorance about how difficult it is to get huge amounts of energy out of these very dilute, thin forms of fuel, like sun and wind. %$* 101
renewable technologies are not moving down the same plummeting cost curves that we’ve seen in our laptops and our cell phones. %$* 101
when you replace conventional with renewable everything gets bigger, not smaller – much, much bigger – and costs get higher, not lower. %$* 101
china and india won’t trade three cent coal for fifteen cent wind or thirty cent solar. %$* 101
and if we force those expensive technologies on ourselves, we will certainly end up doing more harm than good. %$* 101
twenty percent of the planet buys much less carbon, the other eighty percent will be delighted to buy at a lower price. %$* 101
the real jobs will go where the energy is cheap, just as they go where the labor is cheap because manufacturing and heavy industry require so much energy. %$* 101
and in a global economy you can’t possibly compete if you’re paying two or three times as much as your competitors for an essential input. %$* 101
green jobs means americans paying other americans to chase carbon while the rest of the world builds in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) power plants and factories. %$* 101
but the rest of the world is less efficient than us and less careful. %$* 101
a massive transfer of carbon and industry and jobs from us to them will raise carbon emissions. %$* 101
it will not lower them. %$* 101
so, unless we are going to ask the pentagon to take charge – and good luck with that-- %$* 101
we don’t have the power to deliver any lasting reduction in global carbon emissions at all. %$* 101
whatever we might achieve in the very short term at home, we can’t control the global supply of carbon. %$* 101
we can’t control the five billion poor people who desperately want to burn it and who already control more of the demand than we do. %$* 101
and we can’t control the flight of jobs and industry to where the industry is cheap. %$* 101
frantically chasing the impossible and falling flat on your face doesn’t make things better. %$* 101
it often makes things worse and it’s never worth the money. %$* 101
thank you. %$* 13
thank you, peter huber. %$* 13
arguing against the motion, adam werbach. %$* 13
and in the nineties, adam werbach was the whiz kid of the environmentalist movement. %$* 13
at twenty-three he was the president of the sierra club. %$* 13
his views have evolved since then and recently he has been consulting for wal-mart. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, adam werbach. %$* 13
in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) %$* 13
major carbon reductions are worth the money. %$* 102
mr. %$* 102
huber, i want to thank you for your novel argument, summed as, no, we can’t. %$* 102
you begin by saying you care about the world’s poor and then you start by saying, “the five billion poor people are the problem.” we’re going to send our jobs to their shores. %$* 102
they have too many children. %$* 102
this type of contempt will not lead us towards the world that we want to build for our kids, either here or across the world. %$* 102
the question at hand, and the question we face, is, are major reductions in carbon worth the money? %$* 102
and i’ll very simply give examples at the level of the economy, at the level of a corporation and the level of the individual. %$* 102
not is it all investments, every investment – it’s, are major reductions worth the money? %$* 102
mr. %$* 102
huber, i read that you wrote about enhancing america’s electric power grid. %$* 102
that’s a great way of having great reductions in carbon in a way that’s very much worth the money. %$* 102
we waste about six to ten percent of all energy through america’s very inefficient electricity grid. %$* 102
if we invested in a smart grid it could save up to twenty billion dollars a year that’s lost through line loss. %$* 102
major carbon reductions can be worth the money. %$* 102
americans spend about a week a year, if they commute a lot, in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) stuck in their cars. %$* 102
that costs the economy in terms of productivity and fuel costs about $78 billion a year. %$* 102
if we invested in new traffic software and signaling, public transportation to create those green jobs that you have such contempt for, um, we could in fact reduce that, greatly. %$* 102
major carbon reductions are worth the money. %$* 102
at the level of a corporation, more and more corporations are not just doing it because it’s fashionable, they’re doing it because they’re building a strategy for sustainability to move them forward. %$* 102
i’ll give you a few examples. %$* 102
xerox, that iconic american company, around the year 2000 was on the verge of bankruptcy, was, was at its knees, and the vultures were circling. %$* 102
and ann mulcahy, the ceo, when she took over she committed that by 2012 they would reduce their carbon output by 10 percent between 2002 and 2012, and they started investing in remanufacturing, and today 91 percent of all the parts in xerox machines are remanufactured or recycled, which means you don’t need to get new stuff from the earth and much better from a carbon emissions standpoint. %$* 102
well by the year 2006, they reached that 2012 goal, they reached their 10 percent reduction and they actually committed to a 25 percent reduction, by the year 2012.today, in 2009, they’re at about 21 percent and they’re well on their way. %$* 102
there’s a company that’s more productive, that’s making more money for in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) its shareholders, because of strict carbon restrictions. %$* 102
sun microsystems has about half of its workers telecommuting. %$* 102
this saves the worker a few hundred dollars, up to $1000 because they don’t have to commute anymore, and it saves the company money. %$* 102
last year about $68 million in avoided costs because they didn’t have offices for all those people. %$* 102
people get to be more productive, they get to work in their pajamas, it’s a win-win all over the place, major reductions in their carbon use, about 30,000 metric tons saved by that, are good and worth the money. %$* 102
finally a company that i do work with, wal-mart. %$* 102
wal-mart made three commitments in its turn-around, one, to be powered 100 percent by renewable energy which would be a major reduction in carbon. %$* 102
two, to produce zero waste, which would reduce their carbon emissions. %$* 102
and three, to only sell green products in their stores. %$* 102
major commitments by a major manufacturer. %$* 102
they’ve pushed this down the supply chain, it pulled energy out, lowering the cost of the products, lowering the cost to the consumer. %$* 102
and one of the reasons a company like wal-mart is doing so well right now is that they’ve become more efficient, because of a focus on major reductions in carbon. %$* 102
and, one of the associates i was able to work with at wal-mart is named chuck bonnett, i want to give you as an example—at an individual level, how major reductions can actually make sense. %$* 102
in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) chuck works the meat counter at wal-mart, and he made a personal sustainability practice commitment, to reduce the amount of carbon emissions that he had personally. %$* 102
a major reduction in his personal life, in carbon emissions. %$* 102
and he tried to figure out what to do and he was actually in line at a fast food restaurant. %$* 102
and as he was in this line waiting for his burger, he watched all the cars idling and thought, oh, that’s carbon. %$* 102
and he thought about the hamburger which had been, been frozen and shipped across, maybe across the country, perhaps across the world, and he thought about the carbon that came from the cow and the thought about the plastic that was wrapping this hamburger. %$* 102
and he thought you know if i cut that out, it’s not gonna only be good for my health, and he had to lose about 100 pounds, maybe i can get a discount on my health care, and actually, maybe i can save some money ‘cause i’ll cook meals at home rather than going out so much which a lot of people across the world are doing, who have the opportunity to eat out. %$* 102
in this case, major reductions in his own personal carbon emissions, were worth the money. %$* 102
now %$* 102
our opponents tend to focus on the fact that we can’t do everything. %$* 102
and that there are other problems and, yes, there are other problems and we need in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) to work on them. %$* 102
for example, i could tell you tonight, that there are exit signs at the back of the theater and, there’s one at the side of theater and that’s probably very important in case there were a fire, but, maybe i could instead tell you about influenza, because that’s the eighth-largest killer in america and i might tell you worry about the person next to you, ‘cause they might be a little sickly. %$* 102
and you might need to worry about them, or maybe i could check your purses, or check your dinner reservation for later tonight because maybe, you’ll decide to go out and have a dessert or a creamy special appetizer. %$* 102
because you know that heart disease is the greatest killer in america. %$* 102
these things are all true, but we can do two things at once, we can walk and chew gum at the same time. %$* 102
and the great thing about carbon, is that it’s one single thread, if you pull it, the entire sweater begins to unravel. %$* 102
it’s one single step that can help people save money and live better lives at their individual level, at a corporate level, and even at an economy-wide level. %$* 102
major reductions in carbon are good for the economy, and are absolutely worth the money. %$* 102
thank you. %$* 102
thank you, adam werbach. %$* 13
arguing next for the motion, philip stott, professor emeritus from the university of london, his in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) specialty carries the distinct and revealing name of biogeographer, he is an expert in many things, from the nature of fire to the behavior of soil. %$* 13
and tonight he is arguing for the motion. %$* 13
thank you, john. %$* 103
adam and colleagues, i really wish i could believe that we can manage the costs that would control climate. %$* 103
very sadly, i have to quote samuel johnson, the great british lexicographer. %$* 103
“an obstinate stubbornness, a rationality, stops me believing it.” and with a twinkle in my eye, because we’re in new york and near wall street, what i want to show, very dangerously, is that, climate science and these costs are sub-prime science %$* 103
sub-prime economics, and above all, sub-prime politics. %$* 103
and they will cost us dear, despite what adam and oliver and hunter will be saying. %$* 103
and we’ve got to be very, very careful. %$* 103
and bjorn used a very important phrase. %$* 103
let’s not just follow what’s fashionable. %$* 103
in fact, johnson again had a wonderful phrase for it. %$* 103
“let’s not be befuddled, by the clamor of the times.” let me therefore start, by science, i’m not going to say much on science because, i agree with what robert said, right at the start in this. %$* 103
it’s actually not very much about the science, it’s always been about economic and political choice. %$* 103
everything is when it in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) comes down to it, like it or not. %$* 103
but i just want you to have one image, and it’s a very serious scientific image, i want you to think of the world %$* 103
i want you to think of the world from inner siberia, to greenland, then to singapore, and then come to the arab states and to sahara. %$* 103
what, ladies and gentlemen, is the temperature range i have just covered. %$* 103
it is from minus 20 degrees c, to nearly 50 degrees c, a range of 70 degrees c, in which humanity has adapted and learnt to live. %$* 103
we are talking about, ignoring the extremes that oliver said, a prediction of 2 to 3 degrees c, what a funk! %$* 103
i’m very serious, what a funk! %$* 103
humanity lives successfully from greenland to singapore to saudi arabia. %$* 103
70 degrees c.and what is more, the carbon reductions will not produce an outcome that is predictable. %$* 103
climate is the most complex, coupled, non- linear, chaotic system known to man. %$* 103
of course there are human influences in it, nobody denies that. %$* 103
but what outcome will they get, by fiddling with one variable at the margins. %$* 103
i’m sorry, it’s scientific nonsense. %$* 103
and a very serious nonsense. %$* 103
but it’s the economics above all, because that’s the motion, the costs. %$* 103
i come from the left wing politically. %$* 103
i am fed up with environmentalists putting regressive costs and taxes on the poor. %$* 103
it always costs more in the end, whatever in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) adam and the other say, and it’s always fundamentally on the poor. %$* 103
they’ve forgotten the famous jevons paradox, professor jevons from my own country, university college, london, that actually when you save on energy, you don’t really save, you simply transfer it to new energy costs, and actually probably issue more co2.so when you save energy you take another holiday, you take another flight, your co2 increases. %$* 103
and he demonstrated that in the 19th century. %$* 103
have we forgotten this basic economics. %$* 103
but above all, it’s this. %$* 103
i’m going to be honest about this, i don’t trust the environmentalist agenda. %$* 103
for 30 to 40 years, what they have fundamentally been wanting to do, is place an infinity in cost-benefit. %$* 103
in other words, so that the rationality of economic choices is undermined by effectively a religious choice, not an economic choice. %$* 103
under an infinity of course, choice is not made under the procedures that were put down by peter, and by bjorn. %$* 103
but it won’t work. %$* 103
and that leads me, it becomes a closed system of thought, and that always worries me deeply. %$* 103
but it’s the politics then, finally, sub-prime politics. %$* 103
we are full of eco-poseurs and in the united states you have some gems. %$* 103
i don’t think i need to mention them. %$* 103
but what we’ve got to remember is that, this in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) motion is about the cost of artificially in a sense, forcing down the carbon. %$* 103
energy security, efficiency, are of course they’re absolutely vital. %$* 103
energy security will become of the major themes %$* 103
of the obama administration, and rightly so, but that isn’t artificially forcing down carbon. %$* 103
and exactly as peter said, only this week, china announced a 30 percent increase by 2015, in its coal production. %$* 103
actually announced that only this week. %$* 103
and in a sense, we are not being realistic. %$* 103
as i said i would love to be able to think we can control climate, when of course it is indeed going to have to be adaptation, flexibility put to an outcome that we don’t know ‘cause i actually don’t know what climate, they’re wanting to produce for us. %$* 103
and actually i don’t think they know either. %$* 103
but let me come back to johnson again, ‘cause johnson said everything—bible, shakespeare and johnson, you’ve got it. %$* 103
and johnson said virtually everything. %$* 103
in a very, very brilliant book that he wrote in the 18th century there called rasselas, he talks of an astronomer who claims that he can control climate. %$* 103
this is what he says. %$* 103
“the sun has listened to my dictates, and passed from tropic to tropic by my direction. %$* 103
the clouds at my call, have poured their waters.” and what does johnson say about this astronomer—astronomer? %$* 103
he was mad! %$* 103
and so are we, if we actually believe we can control climate in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) predictably, the costs in every sense will be enormous. %$* 103
oh, mamma mia. %$* 103
we are the dancing queens. %$* 103
let’s give this global warming nonsense, its waterloo tonight. %$* 103
thank you. %$* 103
thank you, philip stott. %$* 13
finally, speaking against the motion i’d like to introduce l.hunter lovins. %$* 13
she is the founder of natural capitalism, an organization whose precepts are ecologically friendly development, and research tells us that time magazine has named her a hero of the planet. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, hunter lovins. %$* 13
wow. %$* 104
philip, you ought to be a preacher. %$* 104
you ever heard a more religious proposition? %$* 104
let’s bring it back to economics, i’m a professor of business at presidio school of management, and i teach my students to follow the money. %$* 104
are major reductions in carbon worth the money. %$* 104
that’s what we’re debating, we’re not debating whether or not we can control the climate, we’re not even debating what the climate will be, we’re debating, are major reductions worth the money, and that’s the only question %$* 104
for better or worse that we’re gonna talk about tonight. %$* 104
in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) my company walked into a company that has big warehouses, about a million square feet of warehouse, and boxes stacked floor to ceiling. %$* 104
every 10 feet in the ceiling were 500-watt light bulbs shining down on the tops of boxes. %$* 104
the guys who worked down below had task-lighting so they could see where they were going. %$* 104
we said, y’all have a switch? %$* 104
$650,000 saved the first year, now that is not a cost, to deliver major carbon reductions. %$* 104
similarly we worked with another company that has left its %$* 104
630,000 computers and monitors on 24-7 because they had an urban myth that you, uh, have to leave your computers on. %$* 104
and we pointed out to them that, actually, it did not need them left on 24-7.and a simple company policy that when you turn your computer off you turn it all the way off, saved them $700,000 the first year. %$* 104
again, zero cost, now this is what’s called low-hanging fruit, we could half the carbon in the country. %$* 104
let’s look at what we’re actually spending on carbon, this country borrows somewhere between a billion and $2 billion a day to buy oil, we borrow the money from the chinese, and we send it to the saudis, as jim woolsey who used to run the cia, we’re fighting both sides of the war on terror, we pay for our guys and we send money to the guys who pay for the other guys, now this is daft. %$* 104
we know how to eliminate, at least three quarters of that oil, just in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) through smarter technology, so now you and i and the rest of american taxpayers are gonna bail out detroit because they failed to do this. %$* 104
how about we attach a little string to that money, if we’re gonna own the car companies now, let’s ask them to build the state of the art cars. %$* 104
any of you ever seen a tesla? %$* 104
you wanna go real fast? %$* 104
yeah. %$* 104
we can build safer, faster, peppier, sportier, better cars, that use no energy, now, electric car, okay, you go to google. %$* 104
google recently decided that they could make all of their parking lots carports with solar on ‘em %$* 104
pay back within 10 years, oh, 10 years is a long time, no it’s not. %$* 104
a two-year payback which is what people say they demand, is a 70 percent return on investment. %$* 104
you guys on wall street, you tell me where you can get 70 percent return on investment in today’s market. %$* 104
so google put in these solar-- %$* 104
and they have little pull-down plugs, you bring your electric car, you plug it in. %$* 104
my next car’s gonna be a plug-in hybrid. %$* 104
my friend jim woolsey, the ex-head of the cia, drives a plug-in hybrid he runs on solar on his roof. %$* 104
has a little bumper sticker on it, “osama bin laden hates my car.” major reductions in carbon are worth the money. %$* 104
chicago climate exchange, this is a voluntary group of now over in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) 400 businesses, my company is a member %$* 104
who have pledged to cut their carbon. %$* 104
they have reduced carbon %$* 104
collectively 8 percent. %$* 104
there’s no law that says they have to, you don’t need taxes, you don’t need draconian regulation. %$* 104
we simply need to be smart about how we use energy. %$* 104
they represent companies, 20 percent of the dow jones industrials, and 17 percent of stationery emissions in this country. %$* 104
california, ab-32, new study out from the university of california, fully implementing the republican governor schwarzenegger’s cap on carbon. %$* 104
and trading regime %$* 104
would deliver to california $78 billion, in increased state gross product. %$* 104
$78 billion, and 400,000 new jobs. %$* 104
florida, another republican governor, republican task force study, that cutting carbon emissions 51 percent below the business-as-usual projections, would add $28 billion to state gross product, several hundred thousand new jobs. %$* 104
arizona, even more, 60-some percent cut below now, $5 billion and 200,000 new jobs, there are now studies from 20 states, you add it up %$* 104
if this country implemented aggressive climate protection measures, 500 billion in increased savings to the country, and 5 million green jobs. %$* 104
that’s where the 5 million green jobs number comes from. %$* 104
so let’s bring it home. %$* 104
4 times square down the, down the road? %$* 104
looks like a normal building, costs the same to build, uses half the energy, gets its energy from in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) photo-voltaics in the skin of the building, and a fuel cell in the basement. %$* 104
this building can never be turned off. %$* 104
so in the 2003 northeast blackout, remember that? %$* 104
people came from blocks around to camp out underneath it. %$* 104
genuine homeland security, if we want security, if we want an economy, we wanna have jobs in this country, we will invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy. %$* 104
because it’s what gives us the greatest rate of return. %$* 104
oh, and it also solves the climate problem, assuming there is one. %$* 104
but let’s assume the climate skeptics are right. %$* 104
everything you would do if you were simply a profit-maximizing capitalist, is exactly what you would do if you were scared to death about climate change. %$* 104
a little company across the river, voltaics. %$* 104
my friend peter de nuvila’s chair of this little company, they make the gas precursors for photo-voltaics. %$* 104
because they’re selling a lotta their gases to china, they are now a net exporter—they’re making their county a net exporter to china. %$* 104
again, if we want an economy, we can unleash the greatest %$* 104
prosperity humanity has ever known. %$* 104
and bjorn, i share your, your care for people in developing countries, where are we gonna get the money? %$* 104
we’re gonna get it because we’re going to invest in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and those investments are worth the money. %$* 104
thank you. %$* 104
in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) %$* 104
very nice, thank you—thank you, hunter lovins. %$* 13
and may we just applaud all of our panelists for the presentations that they’ve gone through, thank you. %$* 13
so, where we are in the debate, the time period of uninterrupted speaking is over, we’re going to move into the portion of the evening now where the debaters debate one another, and we are going to call on you the audience shortly to help along that process with your questions but first, as you recall, when you came in this evening we polled you about your view on the motion and we will poll you again after the debate but i have the results that have come in now. %$* 13
reminding you, our motion is, major carbon emissions—major reductions in carbon emissions are not worth the money. %$* 13
the results are interesting. %$* 13
in support of this motion, 16 percent. %$* 13
against the motion, 49 percent, and that leaves 35 percent undecided. %$* 13
and reminding you also that as we say this is a contest to change your mind so that “undecided” becomes very important, if that shrinks, the winner will most likely be determined by whom that goes on. %$* 13
so, i’d like to now come to your questions and what i’m going to do in the beginning is maybe collect two or three and get a sense of the room that way and then begin to put those questions to the panel, so if you in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) wanna just— if you’re ready to ask a question you can raise your hand and i’ll find you, and i see down—right down front %$* 13
third row %$* 13
thank you. %$* 10
is the mic on? %$* 10
now, i think your mic is now on. %$* 13
okay. %$* 10
yes. %$* 13
my question derives from my confusion about the definition of the term, “major.” which two of the panelists for the motion— or against the motion rather, have defined as being individual cost- efficiency, it’s what used to be known as being scottish and frugal. %$* 10
and, but, mr. %$* 10
rosenkranz in introducing the debate spoke about kyoto ii, and the cap-and-trade of effectively tax through auction, that would be imposed constituting he said 2 percent of the gnp of the global economy. %$* 10
that’s a huge amount of money and i was curious under that scheme, who would control those dollars, who would allocate them, and where would the accountability be. %$* 10
in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) %$* 10
all right. %$* 13
i’d like to go to—i’m gonna reserve that, and collect a couple more questions, anybody up the aisle here %$* 13
on the far side, woman in the green jacket? %$* 13
i notice that the panelists who were in favor of the motion spoke a lot about other nations in the world that are not subject to our constraints or, simply aren’t interested in them, as far as we can tell, and the proponents for, mostly talked about what’s going on in the united states, so i’d like to see what the “for” proponents think about the global situation, taking into account china, et cetera. %$* 10
okay, one more? %$* 13
uh, front row. %$* 13
white jacket? %$* 13
well, many environmental impacts such as carbon emissions are merely treated as externalities in terms of economic costs. %$* 10
al gore however suggests that these carbon emissions are treated as total economic costs. %$* 10
how greatly would american industries be affected if these environmental impacts were treated as costs rather than externalities. %$* 10
and do you direct that question to anyone in particular? %$* 13
in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) %$* 13
probably the people for the motion. %$* 10
okay, let’s start, let’s work in reverse order, and bjorn, would you like to take that last question? %$* 13
yeah, and clearly i think any economist would say that we need to actually make sure that the externality, the thing that you don’t pay for, that you actually end up paying for it. %$* 99
but you also have to have a realistic sense of it, and that’s of course where we need to talk, not just about what works, and in particular, companies, but what actually works for the economy. %$* 99
if you look across all the different studies, and professor richard tol has done so, and it’s the latest and the only global survey of all the costs of what is an extra ton of co2 causing of damage in the world, the answer is that’s about $7 per ton of co2.that translates pretty much into 6 cents per gallon of gasoline. %$* 99
so yes, we should have a carbon tax, that’s not what actually gonna do anything majorly for or against our emissions. %$* 99
oliver tickell, what did you hear in that answer? %$* 13
well, i think that the—this whole question that, of paying for externalities associated with carbon emissions is absolutely in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) crucial. %$* 100
and then, you get to the point of if people do pay for externalities in the form perhaps of a carbon tax or an auction price of carbon permits under a cap-and-trade system, what then happens to those funds that are raised. %$* 100
and clearly, there are two ways to go, there is adaptation, there is mitigation, but the greatest of these is mitigation. %$* 100
because the best way that we can serve the victims and potential victims of climate change, is by making sure that it does not happen. %$* 100
philip stott, what’s this head-shake— %$* 13
oh— %$* 103
—so you’re gonna— %$* 13
you—you’re never going to stop climate change, can we just kill one thing off. %$* 103
climate will change without us or with us. %$* 103
and that’s where bjorn is right. %$* 103
bjorn—bjorn is right because always it’s going to have to aid adaptation. %$* 103
if in any way we impoverish ourselves so we cannot help the developing world, that would indeed be a moral mistake of mammoth proportions— %$* 103
whoa, nobody’s talking about impoverishing ourselves, we are talking about the generation of wealth through smart in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) investments. %$* 104
now your question of, who’s gonna spend the money %$* 104

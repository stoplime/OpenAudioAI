we are at war. %$* 75
the president, the congress, the supreme court and the enemy all think we're at war, and you do not. %$* 75
well i suppose the problem that i have, marc, is that i'm old enough to remember when lyndon johnson said we were at war with vietnam and the legacy and the things that were done in the name of the declaration of war which was nonexistent. %$* 78
i regret to say that i'm old enough to remember what one of the presidents of my own party did in the name of national security in watergate and when he tried to use the cia and the fbi in the name of national security. %$* 78
i remember what happened in iran contra. %$* 78
and i remember the efforts made to assassinate patrice lumumba, and premier castro, dr. %$* 78
castro, and how that backlashed in this country, and i'm sorry. %$* 78
the powers of the federal government in the last 50 years destroyed any credibility when we were asked to believe people in power because frequently they know no more than what we can read in the economist or the new york times. %$* 78
now, that information may be subject to different interpretation. %$* 78
but general hayden talked about when in history have we had habeas for enemy combatants. %$* 78
general, your argument is not with me; it's with the supreme court, the majority of whom my presidents appointed. %$* 78
and they brought the argument three times that these people are entitled to habeas review. %$* 78
and if we look at our history, those things that we thought were good in a time of war because the national interest compelled it were wrong. %$* 78
and there is no greater example of that than the internment of 200,000 japanese on the west coast in world war ii because we thought our national security required that we round them up, take them out of their homes and put them in detention camp because they had attacked pearl harbor. %$* 78
at least their imperial navy did. %$* 78
all of which, at least i want to say to the other side, all of which at least go to the issue of violation of core us values that we say define us. %$* 13
your opponents are saying, essentially, and i think they used the word “un-american.” that your position is so at odds with what we value, including, equal protection under the law. %$* 13
that what you’re doing is un-american. %$* 13
can you respond to that? %$* 13
well i will tell you something about that, stephen mentioned american history. %$* 75
no no, i want the answer to his question. %$* 13
no, i’m answering his question. %$* 75
since the revolutionary war, the united stateshas held over 5 million enemy combatants. %$* 75
until the war on terror, not one of them was given habeas corpus rights to petition their detention. %$* 75
the geneva convention, which regulates the conduct of war, nowhere in there does it say that you have a right to contest your detention in a war. %$* 75
my mother is here. %$* 75
and my mother was a prisoner of war. %$* 75
she fought in the warsaw uprising in poland against the nazis. %$* 75
she threw molotov cocktails at german soldiers. %$* 75
and she was taken into a prisoner of war camp in germany that would make guantanamo look like the four seasons. %$* 75
and she was not given the right to petition. %$* 75
you would be referring to the geneva conventions that the bush administration said did not apply. %$* 76
excuse me. %$* 75
yes. %$* 75
well this is the point. %$* 75
you want to give geneva convention rights to terrorists. %$* 75
well you don’t even want to give them geneva convention rights because you don’t accept that it’s a war. %$* 75
but to take the argument to argument. %$* 75
my mother followed the laws of war. %$* 75
she was in an army that carried its weapons openly, that did not target civilians, that wore uniforms or distinctive insignia. %$* 75
terrorists do none of those things; they violate all of the rules of war, and so you want to get more rights-- %$* 75
if i understand your position you want to get more rights to people who violate the laws of war, than rights to the people like my mother who followed the laws of war never had. %$* 75
it’s not that we don’t trust you, but i want to check all this with your mother. %$* 13
is she here? %$* 13
can you stand up for just a moment? %$* 13
is it all true? %$* 13
is it all true, everything he says? %$* 13
are you proud of marc? %$* 13
it’s ironic that i'm being accused of not understanding war. %$* 76
i have been awarded global war on terrorism expeditionary service medal, two national defense service medals, i understand that we are at war. %$* 76
my objection is to the conduct of that war in the way that we have particularly domestically, are operating and, yes, and i have freely acknowledged that we can detain combatants on the battlefield. %$* 76
where there is a question about whether they’re-- %$* 76
what their status is, then they're entitled to a hearing under the geneva conventions. %$* 76
at a minimum, they are entitled-- %$* 76
all persons are entitled to humane treatment. %$* 76
and this is what we got away from in the early years of the bush administration until the supreme court over time reigned in these abuses. %$* 76
but these are the abuses that they would like to get back to. %$* 76
and i think, marc suggested that we want to broaden and expand rights, and you know actually that's not such a bad thing. %$* 76
over time history marches forward and human rights are expanded. %$* 76
and sometimes we extend those rights even to people whom we despise. %$* 76
actually, i’d like to hear from michael hayden. %$* 13
david, we both served in the air force and i commend you for your service but it’s unfair to make that-- %$* 77
again, if you want to talk about what was done in terms of interrogation, again, it’s a separate debate. %$* 77
this is a legal concept. %$* 77
which of the equally valued legal systems do we want to use? %$* 77
domestic criminal law, or the laws of armed conflict? %$* 77
i think we have the right as a nation to use the laws of armed conflict because we were attacked by an opposing armed enemy force. %$* 77
and stephen, i have to say, you have a broad suspicion of government, and you went back to vietnam, and gulf of tonkin, and i think the historical record is quite clouded whether or not the turner joy was fired on by north korean patrol craft. %$* 77
i don’t think that there is any dispute that we were attacked in new york city and in washington. %$* 77
stephen jones to respond. %$* 13
i concede that point, but it’s not the historical accuracy of the initiating incident that’s at issue. %$* 78
it’s what we do about the incident after it’s happened. %$* 78
i’d like to go to the audience for your questions now. %$* 13
and the way this will work, if you raise your hand, my system tends to be geographical, i start on the left and move to the right. %$* 13
a microphone will be brought to you. %$* 13
when the mic reaches you, if you could, stand up and hold it about this far away so the radio and television audience can hear you, we appreciate it, if you're a member of the news media we'd appreciate it if you'd just identify yourself and i just need to shade my eyes for a moment, to see. %$* 13
okay, on the far side in the dark shirt. %$* 13
again i urge you to ask a real question and to keep it terse and you’re not here to debate the debaters, you’re here to help them to debate with each other. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
yes, i think that something has been left somewhat clouded in the discussion, and that is that we've debated here and heard a lot pro and con of whether they should be treated— captured and the way that they’re treated as criminals versus enemy combatants. %$* 18
what i haven’t heard is a clear definition of what the treatment should be when it is declared that they are enemy combatants. %$* 18
in other words are we looking at recourse under military commissions? %$* 18
are we looking at a suspension of some of those concerns because of national security? %$* 18
i think for a lot of people, we’re uneasy as to the definition behind enemy combatant and the set of prerogatives that would set in if that were to prevail, and we are leaving an open mind on that. %$* 18
so perhaps people can clarify that for us? %$* 18
thank you. %$* 13
marc thiessen, i’d like to go to marc because you just wrote a whole book about this. %$* 13
enemy combatants – when you capture someone who’s a member of al qaeda or the taliban or is carrying, for example who tries to set his underwear on fire on a detroit airplane and blow up a plane over detroit that could’ve killed hundreds of people – our position is that that’s an enemy combatant. %$* 75
and that person, when you take him into custody, the first words out of your mouth are not, you have the right to remain silent. %$* 75
because this is the problem with the difference between our approaches and practice, is that they believe, because they are lawyers and this is the world they live in, that the purpose of interrogation is to obtain evidence for a criminal trial. %$* 75
the criminal trial is a third order of interest for those who are involved with protecting the country. %$* 75
the first job is to get intelligence to stop another terrorist attack. %$* 75
so when, for example, the christmas day bomber is questioned for 50 minutes and then told he has the right to remain silent, you’re not going to get, even if he’s being incredibly cooperative, in 50 minutes you could not exhaust all the information. %$* 75
but the thing is that if you were trying to-- %$* 75
if you take the law enforcement approach to interrogation, patience is a virtue. %$* 75
you are trying to get evidence and you can take as much time as you want, build a relationship with the guy, you try to coerce them in an interview, try to co-opt them into giving you information, fool them into giving information. %$* 75
if you are trying to stop a terrorist attack, patience is deadly. %$* 75
this guy-- %$* 75
when the christmas day bomber was captured, he was supposed to be vaporized on that plane. %$* 75
as soon as al qaeda found out that he was alive and in u.s.custody, they started covering his tracks. %$* 75
they started shutting down e-mail addresses, they started shutting down camps where he was training, they started hiding operatives who he knows about, they started hiding safe houses and closing them down. %$* 75
so he takes three weeks to do-- %$* 75
and he’s even trained in interrogation resistance-- %$* 75
to buy time and use the legal system in order to buy his fellows on the outside time. %$* 75
we need to get that information quickly. %$* 75
okay. %$* 76
i’d like to respond to that. %$* 76
i just wanted david frakt to respond to this. %$* 13
a little bit of an unclarity and that is that even after a lawyer is assigned, i believe that interrogation can proceed. %$* 18
isn’t that correct? %$* 18
but he doesn’t have to answer any questions. %$* 75
once he has a lawyer, he’s not going to answer any questions. %$* 75
i will tell you there were many people who did cooperate-- %$* 18
no, first of all, i will tell you who says this: eric holder. %$* 75
eric holder, after john walker lindh was captured in afghanistan and brought over here, eric holder was being interviewed on cnn in 2002 and they said can they get tough with him in the interrogation and he said well he’s not going to tell you anything now that he has a lawyer and is in america. %$* 75
speaking from experience, people with lawyers and confess all the time. %$* 78
they confess even though they’ve been given their miranda rights. %$* 78
so maybe you think osama bin laden, to use the most extreme example, is not familiar with the rule of miranda? %$* 78
i mean they use-- %$* 78
most of those of us who practice law daily in the courts of law know that many police detectives are just as skilled as the people you want to use enhanced detection, that the purpose of interrogation is not prosecution, it’s to gather evidence frequently on an intelligence basis whether it’s financial crimes or drug crimes, and that many thousands of defendants who are told they have the right to remain silent, spill their guts. %$* 78
i’d like to get back to the question which was a good one and given that this was a motion that was proposed by our opponents, i thought that they would try to define it. %$* 76
but actually what we’re doing is constantly shifting back and forth because they say, well, we’re at war, so it’s enemy combatants. %$* 76
we acknowledge in the active battlefield and active theater of conflict in iraq, in afghanistan, those who are actively fighting against us are enemy combatants and can be treated under the laws of war. %$* 76
now where it gets murky is when we’re talking about people here in the united states. %$* 76
and the prior administration’s policies were to treat americans, american citizens as enemy combatants, american citizens were locked up in military prisons for years and before that case could ever go to the supreme court, they decided to drop it. %$* 76
so we have to differentiate between an active battlefield and what’s going on domestically. %$* 76
now mr. %$* 76
thiessen says that membership, if we pick up someone who’s a member of taliban or al qaeda-- %$* 76
i mean, these people do not carry membership cards. %$* 76
and we also have to distinguish between al qaeda and taliban. %$* 76
the taliban is a fighting force in afghanistan and pakistan. %$* 76
they just want us to leave. %$* 76
they are not terrorists. %$* 76
they're not launching international terrorist attacks. %$* 76
al-qaeda is. %$* 76
i would argue that the taliban was essentially the lawful military government and military force of afghanistan at the time we attacked and therefore was entitled to geneva convention status protection as prisoners of war. %$* 76
but we did not afford them that. %$* 76
another thing that's important to talk about is when we say terrorist, what they're really talking about are suspected terrorists, people that they believe may be terrorists. %$* 76
now, if someone tries to light their underwear on fire in a plane, yes, you have a pretty good indication that they're a terrorist. %$* 76
but it's usually not that clear cut. %$* 76
it's usually based on some intelligence from some source or method that we're not allowed to know about that they suspect someone. %$* 76
and in that case, to simply lock that person up, incommunicado for potentially for years, if i'm understanding what marc is proposing, is problematic. %$* 76
and we have gotten a lot of the wrong people. %$* 76
now, yes, if we interrogate. %$* 76
wait, actually-- %$* 13
i have one point about interrogation-- %$* 76
very quickly, because i have to-- %$* 13
we interrogate people-- %$* 76
yes, people have information. %$* 76
we may eventually get it. %$* 76
but why limit it to terrorists? %$* 76
why don't we do that to every single person that's suspected of any crime? %$* 76
why not drug traffickers because-- %$* 76
we'll come back to that because we're going to keep going in circles on the same territory, and i want to move it. %$* 13
and i bet we do come back to it. %$* 13
in uniform, the third row. %$* 13
i believe you're-- %$* 13
are you part of the west point contingent? %$* 13
i am, sir. %$* 19
my name is captain cinnamon macer i'm a judge advocate for the u.s.army, currently assigned to the united states military academy, the department of law. %$* 19
i do teach constitutional and military law. %$* 19
we have some work that put us here this evening. %$* 19
let me clarify first this comes in my personal capacity. %$* 19
i'm asking this question not anything to do with the army or west point. %$* 19
i clearly acknowledge that you are more intelligent that i, that you have the access to information i never will. %$* 19
my question comes in the fact that i'm assuming, aside from you, sir, that maybe you've never been deployed. %$* 19
no, i have not. %$* 75
i've been to iraq. %$* 19
i've been to afghanistan. %$* 19
without fail, every time i interacted with an iraqi or an afghan, their single question to me was this: how do you explain guantanamo bay? %$* 19
let me ask you my question. %$* 19
my question is not whether we should treat them like enemy combatants or criminals, but whichever we decide, there are always consequences to a decision. %$* 19
and if you take it out and extract what-- %$* 19
the implication this causes for those of us who are fighting these wars, who do know we are a nation at war, so in the next year as i leave for my third deployment, possibly, when i get out there, or as i'm teaching my cadets, this is the way we do things because we're america, how do i justify us giving it the moral high ground? %$* 19
and do you think we are? %$* 13
absolutely. %$* 19
we can't go around and champion ourselves as the land of the free and the just-- %$* 19
michael hayden. %$* 13
in the case of vs. %$* 19
bush, there was a-- %$* 19
i'm going to let them get to the question. %$* 13
something. %$* 19
may i finish? %$* 19
no. %$* 13
i-- %$* 13
you're good. %$* 13
that's all you get, 30 seconds. %$* 13
but the law says-- %$* 19
ma'am, please. %$* 13
ma'am, ma'am. %$* 13
nations principles of-- %$* 19
of law. %$* 19
please. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 77
first of all, captain, thank you for your service. %$* 77
i'm puzzled. %$* 77
i understand the image of guantanamo. %$* 77
and we had serious questions inside the bush administration about guantanamo. %$* 77
as david suggested, we took about two-thirds of the prison population out of guantanamo, not as david suggested, because we thought they were innocent. %$* 77
we actually transferred them to third countries actually to kind of home of record with the assumption that they would then be held there or watched there so that they would no longer be a danger, all right? %$* 77
i guess if you believe we are at war and that these are enemy combatants, we've got to put them somewhere. %$* 77
i'm not wedded to guantanamo. %$* 77
i understand the image issue. %$* 77
but our right to detain them, i think, is unarguable under the laws of armed conflict. %$* 77
and-- %$* 77
to be held for eight years without trial or with evidence against you. %$* 19
no. %$* 77
captain, i'm sorry. %$* 77
you're the lawyer, and i'm not, all right? %$* 77
but nowhere does geneva require us to try enemy combatants. %$* 77
i sat with-- %$* 77
in my last capacity as head of cia, i had multiple visits from the president of the international red cross as we were trying to get closer to some of the things they were suggesting to us. %$* 77
he never suggested we had to try anybody. %$* 77
they did have-- %$* 77
as david knows, they have csrts, combatant status review tribunals, which is what happens within the military. %$* 77
it is the tradition of the military to ensure through this process, due process, that the individual you have is indeed the individual you believe them to be. %$* 77
i just don't understand what of this enemy is unlawful. %$* 77
and the unlawful combatant or unprivileged belligerent is the new phraseology. %$* 77
what does that give them rights that 6 million other prisoners of war we've held as a nation have not had? %$* 77
marc thiessen, do you want to join your partner on this one, because i think-- %$* 13
i do want to, because i-- %$* 75
i thank you also for your service, but i think my answer to you is what you say is you should defend the other people in uniform who serve proudly at guantanamo and keep this country safe. %$* 75
the fact is that most of those people are asking those questions because of misstatements, mistruths and lies that have been spread about guantanamo bay. %$* 75
you mean the iraqis are misinformed. %$* 13
iraqis, people around the world because people in-- %$* 75
these allegations go out there and, as my old boss, donald rumsfeld used to say, the truth goes around the world 30 times before-- %$* 75
lies go around the world 30 times before troops get their boots off. %$* 75
every investigation into conduct at guantanamo bay has found these allegations of widespread abuse are false. %$* 75
brigadier generals schmidt and furlow did a careful investigation. %$* 75
no, quote, no evidence of torture or inhumane treatment at jcf guantanamo. %$* 75
they've made the inspector general a.t.church, who i interviewed for my book, and who said he expected to find widespread abuse at guantanamo said that when he investigated, conducted hundreds of interviews, interviewed detainees, interviewed everybody who had been there. %$* 75
he said we can confidently state, based upon this investigation, we found nothing that would any way substantiate detainees’ allegations of torture or violent physical abuse at guantanamo. %$* 75
now, i'll tell you something. %$* 75
we are also hearing from the other side that people there are the poor sheep herders and goat herders who have been wrapped up and taken to guantanamo. %$* 75
the combat leadership of the taliban today is made up of guantanamo alumni. %$* 75
just last week in yemen, the yeminis arrested a guantanamo alumnus who was joining al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula. %$* 75
and the man who is one of the leaders of al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula who sent the christmas day bomber is a former guantanamo inmate. %$* 75
these are dangerous, dangerous people. %$* 75
okay. %$* 13
and even the obama administration's review found 95 percent of the people who are there right now are either leaders or fighters for al-qaeda and the taliban. %$* 75
marc, thank you. %$* 13
david frakt, do you want to respond? %$* 13
but i sort of feel the captain did your work for you on that question. %$* 13
well, i want to respond to a specific point made by marc about this reports, investigations into detainee abuse at guantanamo and the claim that they searched, and they didn't find anything. %$* 76
he referenced the church report, the schmidt-furlow report. %$* 76
when i was representing mohammed jawad, a teenage boy from afghanistan at guantanamo, a prosecutor by the name of lieutenant colonel darrel vandeveld turned over some discovery materials to me that showed that my then, at that point, 16 or 17- year-old client had been subjected to what was called the frequent flyer sleep deprivation program. %$* 76
and according to the schmidt-furlow report, they had discovered that there had been a frequent flyer sleep deprivation program. %$* 76
and during this program, detainees were moved, and in the case of my client, 112 times from cell to cell during a two-week period. %$* 76
he was moved constantly back and forth in an effort to deprive him of sleep. %$* 76
and so-- %$* 76
but according to the schmidt-furlow report, this program had been stopped after a complaint by the fbi, it had been stopped in march of 2004.the only problem with that was that my client had been subjected to the program in may of 2004.and so i asked colonel vandeveld to continue digging, and he found additional records that showed that this program continued for at least another year. %$* 76
and dozens of other people were subjected to it. %$* 76
in fact, we had the person who ran the program. %$* 76
there was a major, who was an intelligence officer in the army, came to testify at guantanamo in the hearing that-- %$* 76
in which i was representing a detainee and said this was standard operating procedure. %$* 76
the generals knew about it. %$* 76
everybody was vetted and approved. %$* 76
so these investigations were white washes. %$* 76
they missed widespread abuses. %$* 76
i tried to bring this to the attention of the department of defense. %$* 76
i filed a report of a violation of the law of armed conflict, as is my duty to do as a military officer. %$* 76
what did they do? %$* 76
nothing, no follow-up investigation, i was never contacted. %$* 76
so we have a very basic disagreement about what we think is happening inside the walls of guantanamo. %$* 13
you say that basically there have been very few undocumented violations and david is saying that these are whitewashed, that there's reports that say that. %$* 13
i think that's a shocking thing to say about admiral church and those people who are-- %$* 75
you know, people who wore our uniform with honor-- %$* 75
hold on, no, you talked, now let me-- %$* 75
marc, respond, please. %$* 13
okay, let me get a word in here, please. %$* 75
now wait, you've had no problem on getting the words in. %$* 13
this frequent flier program you referred to, where for someone who's moved once every four hours roughly, two to four hours, what do you think these detainees in guantanamo do all day? %$* 75
they're not busting rocks. %$* 75
they're not making a license plates. %$* 75
they sleep. %$* 75
they read the koran. %$* 75
they play foosball. %$* 75
they play soccer. %$* 75
they eat whenever they want, sleep whenever they want. %$* 75
this is not torture. %$* 75
there is frequent flier. %$* 75
you may not like it. %$* 75
but i'll tell you something, people-- %$* 75
interrogation, interrogation techniques, even interrogation techniques under the geneva convention people would find shocking if you're not familiar with interrogation-- %$* 75
interrogation is not supposed to be pleasant. %$* 75
and you have in the case of some of these people who are at guantanamo, people who are senior al-qaeda leaders, senior taliban leaders who have intelligence about the possibility of planned attacks against the united states and they have the responsibility to get them within the rules of law, and they did it. %$* 75
and these-- %$* 75
investigations were conducted, they were open, and they found no evidence of widespread abuse. %$* 75
and that's because the senior al-qaeda leaders were locked up in secret cia ghost prisons in eastern european countries and in thailand and places that we were not allowed to know about, that's where the worst abuses went on, but there were plenty of horrific abuses at guantanamo-- %$* 76
i'll come back. %$* 77
was the director of the cia. %$* 13
i'll come back with a debate on interrogation techniques, just sign me up. %$* 77
to summarize the last statement, i believe the american armed forces are competent and capable of holding enemy combatants as prisoners of war consistent with the laws of armed conflict. %$* 77
discussion about that point or distraction from the basic question we have in front of us today. %$* 77
another question from the audience? %$* 13
and i just want to encourage you, again, the captain's question was terrific, but please to keep the rhetorical flourishes to a minimum because they chew up time and the question was so good all by itself. %$* 13
in the front row, and then i'll start moving up after that. %$* 13
could you-- %$* 13
so could you please rise just so the camera can find you? %$* 13
kayvon afshari, cbs news. %$* 18
i do want to come back to david frakt's fundamental point, and i'd like to get a response from marc in particular. %$* 18
a lot of the guilt or innocence of these suspected enemy combatants is a lot more nebulous than that of abdulmutallab, so i just want to know on a very practical level if we don't go through the criminal justice system, how do we know if they are terrorists? %$* 18
first of all, it's not about guilt. %$* 75
you don't have to prove guilt. %$* 75
these are not criminal defendants. %$* 75
you have to have a reasonable belief that these people were captured in the war and that they are members of al-qaeda or the taliban and were conducting operations against us. %$* 75
the fact is, we have detained in the war on terror well over 100,000 people. %$* 75
only 800 made it to guantanamo. %$* 75
only 100 made it into the cia program. %$* 75
so these are-- %$* 75
we're not just picking people up off the street and throwing them in guantanamo. %$* 75
were there some people that were sent there by accident, that we made a mistake? %$* 75
our enemy doesn't wear uniforms. %$* 75
they don’t follow a chain of command is hard. %$* 75
there's some mistakes made, absolutely, and we had a process in guantanamo that was set up to review the evidence against them and to make sure that people who were not-- %$* 75
didn't belong there were sent back. %$* 75
but the reality is that we got - - you know, if we-- %$* 75
the left always wants to get this debate onto the topic of abuse. %$* 75
this is a debate about keeping this country safe with the exception of one of our debaters. %$* 75
michael hayden. %$* 13
what's the judicial process you would use for killing the believed enemy combatant as opposed to capturing him? %$* 77
stephen jones. %$* 13
well, i think, marc, the problem that i have, and i think david is right, capturing people on the battlefield is different than arresting someone at the detroit airport for committing or attempting to commit what is clearly a violation of the federal criminal law, and cannot take that person consistent with the constitution of the united states and title 18, which is the criminal code, and try him other than in a federal criminal court according to the federal rules of criminal procedure and the federal rules of evidence and to maintain that you can-- %$* 78
you’re wrong. %$* 75
well, you’re wrong. %$* 78
no. %$* 75
we don’t have a separate criminal justice system for people that commit crimes in the united states. %$* 78
and it isn’t a question mark of politics or the left or the right-- %$* 78
stephen, could you just stay with your mic please? %$* 13
or bush versus obama. %$* 78
it’s a question of the constitution. %$* 78
it’s not political, it’s constitutional and there’s one system of law in this country. %$* 78
now i will concede that in a battlefield situation abroad or outside the united states, the line is blurry. %$* 78
but when you start saying that you’re going to arrest people and try them in a military tribunal for crimes committed in the united states against american citizens, i don’t think the american people will tolerate that. %$* 78
stephen-- %$* 18
this is an intelligence squared debate. %$* 13
i’m john donvan of abc and i’m serving as moderator as we debate this motion: “treat terrorists like enemy combatants not criminals.” we have two teams against two who are hashing it out. %$* 13
we are now going to marc thiessen to respond to the point just made. %$* 13
first of all, ex parte quirin 1942, this is the supreme court: one who takes up arms against the united states in a foreign theater of war regardless of his position shall be regarded properly as an enemy combatant and treated as such. %$* 75
it doesn’t matter whether they’re a citizen or not. %$* 75
i would now assume that you now consider franklin roosevelt was a war criminal because of the military commissions for the saboteurs who were captured here are unconstitutional as well. %$* 75
and on top of that, military commissions that have been held outside of the article three court going back to george washington. %$* 75
i assume he’s not a war criminal either. %$* 75
but again, you’re completely focused on the criminal justice system. %$* 75
i don’t care if we put khalid sheikh mohammed on trial or not when we capture him. %$* 75
when khalid sheikh mohammed is captured, i want to know what his plans for the next attack are. %$* 75
my question to you is you’re focused on where he’s going to be tried. %$* 75
i want to find out what he knows. %$* 75
when khalid sheikh mohammed was captured, if you were the one who was responsible for getting the information, in the case he’s captured, he’s killed 3000 people just down the street from here. %$* 75
he admits to you that he has plans for new attacks in motion. %$* 75
does khalid sheikh mohammed have the right to remain silent? %$* 75
well of course he has the right to remain silent. %$* 78
the only difference between your position and mine is that you don’t think that he should be told he has the right to remain silent and i think it’s beside the point because of course he knows he has the right to remain silent. %$* 78
so you’re saying-- %$* 75
let’s say we captured khalid sheikh mohammed before the 9/11 attacks. %$* 75
put aside the litany of attacks that he had in play. %$* 75
you would have allowed 9/11 to go on rather that to get him to give the information that he had. %$* 75
now marc, let’s don’t defend the indefensible here. %$* 78
it’s not the indefensible. %$* 75
khalid sheikh mohammed killed 3000 people in this country. %$* 75
he had information, a plot to blow up the library tower in los angeles, blow up a marine camp in djibouti, to blow up the consulate in karachi. %$* 75
these are real attacks. %$* 75
to commit, repeat 9/11 in london. %$* 75
well that may be true but i don’t want to take “the weekly standard’s” word for it or frankly your book. %$* 78
if all of that is true, then it can be presented to an american jury. %$* 78
an american jury will convict him and give him the death penalty. %$* 78
what if the clock is ticking in the situation that marc’s just described .you believe he knows about something that’s about to happen we’re five minutes away. %$* 13
would it make a difference? %$* 13
there’s a movie about that and i think that’s an over-dramatization of the issue. %$* 78
those who look for a way to short-cut the system always first bring forward the most extreme example of what could happen. %$* 78
but the truth of the matter is those extreme examples rarely exist. %$* 78
where they do exist, i believe the intelligence community and the law enforcement community have on numerous occasions shown the ability much better than politicians to protect individual security or, for that matter, national security. %$* 78
david frakt, you wanted-- %$* 13
yes. %$* 76
i mean the whole ticking time bomb scenario is really a red herring. %$* 76
first of all, police, in the situation where there is an urgent public safety emergency are not required to give the miranda warning. %$* 76
so-- %$* 76
but if your question is should we use torture in that situation? %$* 76
and that’s essentially what marc is saying is that, you know, in order to prevent an attack, you have to be willing to do anything, whatever it takes. %$* 76
and that's where we have a fundamental disagreement. %$* 76
if we captured osama bin laden, i would not torture him. %$* 76
is that possibly going to lead to an attack that might have been prevented? %$* 76
it might. %$* 76
are you okay with that? %$* 13
i am okay with it because it would be a great tragedy. %$* 76
but it would be a greater tragedy to go down the road which we already went down of torturing, because that one attack may not be averted, but you are going to multiply the attacks for years to come because of the torture. %$* 76
and that is what we have done. %$* 76
again, i-- %$* 77
i'll come back and walk, if you like a debate on a different subject but as the only one on stage who has actually had the question in front of him as to whether or not it-- %$* 77
except, michael, that your partner brought these issues to the table himself in his opening remarks in talk-- %$* 13
in justifying and laying out several scenarios in which the actual methods did do it. %$* 13
i think they're relevant. %$* 13
i don't think it's-- %$* 13
it's not a vote on that, but i think it's germane to understanding what the motion means. %$* 13
and i'd like to see if marc could respond to what was just said because this is where the rubber hit the road. %$* 13
well, actually, no. %$* 77
let me finish, because the rubber hit the road on my car, all right? %$* 77
i'm the one who has to make the decision, okay? %$* 77
these are not easy decisions. %$* 77
there are conflicting values. %$* 77
there are moral responsibilities galore, okay? %$* 77
no one should trivialize it, and no one should throw bumper stickers at the difficulty of the decision people like me, people like leon panetta, have to make, all right? %$* 77
but i come back-- %$* 77
but i come back to the fundamental question, the american armed forces, the american intelligence community are capable of holding people, consistent with the laws of armed conflict. %$* 77
i feel as if we have gone through the looking glass in the last 30 to 40 minutes as we try to take people who are armed enemy combatants-- %$* 77
and david did not make the straw man that iraq is okay to capture, it's not okay to capture and keep enemy combatants in brooklyn, okay? %$* 77
what about mali? %$* 77
what about djibouti, what about yemen? %$* 77
what about the horn of africa? %$* 77
what about pakistan? %$* 77
that is where the enemy is. %$* 77
that is where the enemy is mounting an attack against our citizens. %$* 77
they are enemy combatants. %$* 77
and as god is my judge, i will use the full authority that the law of armed conflict gives me as long as my president and my congress has given me that authorization. %$* 77
and your partner, marc thiessen. %$* 13
i would add to that to complete. %$* 75
we're not going to have time to debate all of the interrogation techniques. %$* 75
they were not torture. %$* 75
and i can walk you through it if you really want to. %$* 75
i'd rather not. %$* 76
well-- %$* 75
well, i'll tell you something. %$* 75
you said something, and this is – you’re sort of dismissive of the threat in a very sort of disturbing way. %$* 75
you said well, yeah, i've let the-- %$* 75
you basically admitted you had let the attack happened and treat him as a criminal rather than an enemy combatant. %$* 75
you know, you said earlier, when-- %$* 75
about my introductory remark, two little terrorist networks. %$* 75

the outsiders were occupying them. %$* 88
this is-- %$* 88
if we want to keep this kind of mindset about the taliban, then we can fight them for decades. %$* 88
has everyone seen the film “gladiator”? %$* 88
okay, remember in the beginning they’re fighting the germans and one general turns to russell crow and says “don’t people ever know when they’re beaten? %$* 88
” and russell crow says, “would you? %$* 88
” same thing. %$* 88
this is human nature. %$* 88
it is, it’s human nature. %$* 88
who here as a kid watched “red dawn”? %$* 88
okay? %$* 88
right? %$* 88
i mean, when i went into the marine corp, you know, i grew up in my 10 years in the marine corp, “red dawn” was probably my favorite movie, okay? %$* 88
if the russians had invaded, i would have fought them. %$* 88
it’s the same type of principle, okay? %$* 88
we’re dealing with people who primarily see the reason for supporting the taliban as occupation and a government that excludes them. %$* 88
if we drive a wedge between them and the taliban who i’m not saying there are no taliban who are aligned with al qaeda. %$* 88
there are. %$* 88
but split them. %$* 88
why fight all of them when we can negotiate with 80 percent of them. %$* 88
right in the front row. %$* 13
and there’re three hands up. %$* 13
i mean the person in the middle. %$* 13
yes, you chose correctly. %$* 13
could you stand up, please. %$* 13
just give a second for the camera-- %$* 13
i’m a high school senior on long island and my question is that this debate seems to come down to all about is afghanistan is a lost cause in terms of military occupation and although i agree with that, i’d like to ask you, what about humanitarian efforts? %$* 18
i mean, since nato presence there’s been an increase in health care availability to have assistance from nine percent to 85 percent, a 50 percent increase in crop yield due to i mean, how can you denounce the fact that there’s been a massive increase in terms of quality of life for the average afghani civilian? %$* 18
so you agree with the side arguing against the motion that there’s a lot of progress? %$* 13
in terms of this debate, i don’t agree that the military presence-- %$* 18
i believe the military presence is a lost cause but i do think the humanitarian efforts being at present have-- %$* 18
all right. %$* 13
since that actually was part of max boot’s opening argument. %$* 13
that there are a lot of other aspects of life that are succeeding, i’d like you to take that question. %$* 13
yeah, the u.s.has spent since 2001, 50 billion dollars on foreign assistance in afghanistan. %$* 88
the average life expectancy of an afghan is 44 years of age. %$* 88
one in five children die before their fifth birthday. %$* 88
yeah, one in five. %$* 88
so what is the biggest tragedy for an american family is a rite of passage for an afghan family. %$* 88
access to electricity is less than 10 percent for the afghan people and when i say access, that’s three to four hours. %$* 88
there have been some successes. %$* 88
but this is still a country that is ripped apart by war. %$* 88
so what you need to do is find a way to keep those successes and end the conflict in the other part of the country. %$* 88
so it is, it’s a mixed thing but to say that they’ve only benefited from our presence there, some have but many, many have not. %$* 88
sir? %$* 13
could you stand please? %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
reid schoenfeld a one-time newsman. %$* 18
i used to work for you, actually, a long time ago. %$* 13
you didn’t pay very well at all. %$* 13
i’m not going to forget that. %$* 13
i think you came after i left. %$* 18
you would have been more poorly paid if i was still there. %$* 18
but why, if 90 percent of the afghans don’t like the taliban and why did general casey, excuse me, general oates michael oates stand up in washington 21 days ago and he’s the guy in charge of trying to eliminate ieds and he uses ground sensor devices to do that among others say that there’s little utility in the use of ground sensor devices against ieds because as soon as they were planted, the local population told the taliban-- %$* 18
about it and the local taliban appeared, either avoided them or appeared and unplanted them. %$* 18
max boot. %$* 13
well the problem of ieds was actually far worse in iraq than it is in afghanistan. %$* 89
and what we found there and the general is right, there’s not a quick technological fix for ieds. %$* 89
what works in getting rid of ieds, the roadside bombs the insurgents set, is to implement classic counter-insurgency strategy, to bring security to the villages, to bring development to the villages, to protect the people from the insurgents. %$* 89
and once you protect them from the insurgents, they will then be willing to rat out the insurgents who are in their midst and tell you where the ieds are being planted. %$* 89
that is exactly the strategy that our forces are now implementing in afghanistan. %$* 89
they are bringing security to the villages and to the towns. %$* 89
and as they do that, as they provide a more secure environment, it will be impossible for the taliban to plant ieds. %$* 89
there is not a quick technological fix to it. %$* 89
but what we found is that these classic tried and true counterinsurgency techniques are incredibly successful. %$* 89
in afghanistan-- %$* 89
in iraq, they led within a couple of years to a more than 90 percent decline in violence. %$* 89
taking effect in afghanistan. %$* 89
i see similar success happening in areas like nala where our troops have been a little bit longer than they are in-- %$* 89
matthew i would like you to respond to that as well. %$* 13
actually, when i was in iraq, i was a combat engineer in the marine corps where i had to actually go out and look for ieds. %$* 88
or my marines-- %$* 88
i was an officer, so my marines did, you know. %$* 88
but max is correct, but it's not working. %$* 88
gareth porter, a journalist for inter press service-- %$* 88
we don't know it's not working. %$* 89
we know it's not working, max, because-- %$* 88
we're just starting to do it now. %$* 89
no, we're not starting to do it. %$* 88
has there-- %$* 88
i mean, again, i'll refer to a movie because it's-- %$* 88
we've been doing counterinsurgency for years-- %$* 88
i can't argue with “red dawn.” you've got me there. %$* 89
yeah.it is a great film, right? %$* 88
but i would urge you all to see the film “restrepo”-- %$* 88
it's a documentary done by a journalist-- %$* 88
to see what it's like to be an american infantryman in afghanistan. %$* 88
but that film was done three and a half years ago. %$* 88
and you see our soldiers doing counterinsurgency then. %$* 88
the lieutenant general barno who was in command of our forces in 2004 said we are moving to a counterinsurgency strategy. %$* 88
what max is talking about, and he's right, that is counterinsurgency strategy to try and get the population to support you and turn in the ieds. %$* 88
in southern afghanistan where we have insurgent troops for several years now, the first marines, the first u.s.marines went back into southern afghanistan two and a half years ago into those parts of hellman where we're still losing guys every day. %$* 88
the success rate and the percentage of ieds that were being turned in by the population, less than two percent. %$* 88
the population is not embracing our presence. %$* 88
we have time for one more question. %$* 13
ma'am. %$* 13
i'm favoring the bright lights tonight because of the television. %$* 13
so you mentioned several times, matthew, that you had-- %$* 19
for us not to pull out exactly, but you had some sort of other solution. %$* 19
and i'm wondering if afghanistan is a lost cause, could we accept that it's not just a question of methodology, but our actual presence there. %$* 19
what is the alternative? %$* 19
what will happen when we leave? %$* 19
and what can, i guess, we do? %$* 19
and what can afghanis do? %$* 19
i guess that's it. %$* 19
i want to pass to a different question because it doesn't really go to the issue we're trying to decide tonight. %$* 13
i think it's a very valid question, but it's more about if it's lost, then what? %$* 13
and if you-- %$* 13
respectfully, i'd like to try one other question. %$* 13
yes, on the far right. %$* 13
thank you, though, for that. %$* 13
i had experience with counterinsurgency in south vietnam as a marine. %$* 18
and i am a little concerned about the karzai government and their move to disarm the contractors. %$* 18
i think that if one goes out of your base to try and help the village and counteract whatever taliban influence there is, without good security,-- %$* 18
if they're disarmed, and you depend upon the afghani police, is our effort outside going to collapse? %$* 18
in other words, is our village pacification in afghanistan going to disappear if karzai really disarms the professionals? %$* 18
what's scary is that we've spent $27 billion building the afghan police and the afghan army after nine years, and we can't rely on them to protect humanitarian assistance projects. %$* 88
losing the private security for development workers there is very troubling. %$* 88
and it will have a severe impact on humanitarian assistance. %$* 88
actually, i think this is a good move on president karzai's part because these private security companies have been a big part of the problem in afghanistan because they've run roughshod over a lot of the country. %$* 89
and we've relied upon them for years because we didn't make a serious effort to send our own troops or to build up the afghan security forces. %$* 89
we have not tried to create an afghan security force large enough to stabilize and secure the entire country. %$* 89
we're only now making that attempt. %$* 89
and as we do that, we can be less reliant on the private contractors who are out of control in many cases and under poor supervision. %$* 89
and we can rely more on our own troops and more on the afghan troops that they are mentoring alongside of them. %$* 89
and you will see an increase in security. %$* 89
so i think this is actually-- %$* 89
i'm critical of president karzai for a lot of things, but i think is actually a positive initiative. %$* 89
the afghan troops are part of the problem. %$* 90
it's the afghan police who are the best recruiters for the taliban by oppressing people, by stealing from them, by demanding bribes. %$* 90
that's because they haven't had salaries, and they haven't had training. %$* 89
and both of that is changing there. %$* 89
and that concludes round two of this debate. %$* 13
and here's where we are. %$* 13
we are about to hear brief closing statements from each debater. %$* 13
they will be two minutes each. %$* 13
it's their last chance to change your minds because we're going to ask you right after that to vote one more time. %$* 13
remember, we asked you to vote before the debate. %$* 13
we're going to ask you to vote again right after these closing statements. %$* 13
and the team that has changed the most minds will be declared our winner. %$* 13
onto round three, closing statements from each debater in turn. %$* 13
our motion is “afghanistan is a lost cause.” and here to argue his position against the motion, max boot, senior fellow at the council on foreign relations and the author of “war made new.” %$* 13
well, guess what, folks? %$* 89
my pre-debate intuition held up pretty well. %$* 89
the other side has not even come close to proving their case that afghanistan is a lost cause. %$* 89
what they have essentially done is they've thrown up various problems that exist in afghanistan. %$* 89
and i-- %$* 89
we agree with them. %$* 89
there are a lot of problems that exist. %$* 89
there are a lot of problems that existed in iraq. %$* 89
there are a lot of problems that existed in malay and colombia and el salvador, in peru and many other places where insurgencies have been defeated. %$* 89
but the fact that the problems exist does not mean that we cannot overcome them. %$* 89
and for the very first time, we are making a serious effort to overcome them. %$* 89
matt talked to you about how we've been trying to do counterinsurgency in afghanistan for years. %$* 89
no, we haven't. %$* 89
we have not made a serious commitment to do counterinsurgency in afghanistan until right now. %$* 89
when you have 30,000 troops in a country of 30 million people, you are not doing serious counterinsurgency, no matter what your generals say. %$* 89
we are starting to do serious counterinsurgency right now with hardened-- %$* 89
battle hardened troops, experienced in both afghanistan and iraq, led by our finest general, implementing many of the lessons we have learned, not only in iraq but many other conflicts. %$* 89
we are addressing local grievances, the very things that matt says is driving the insurgency. %$* 89
we are working with provincial reconstruction teams and district support teams to improve lighting, to decrease corruption, to improve economic development, all these things that people want. %$* 89
there is-- %$* 89
i think it is crazy right now when the surge is just beginning to suggest that it already has no chance of success. %$* 89
it is ahistorical. %$* 89
it-- %$* 89
when you look at the fact that, as i mentioned in my opening statements, many wars have been won when countries faced far more dire circumstances than we face today. %$* 89
and i go back to the fact that the people of afghanistan are fundamentally on our side. %$* 89
somebody asked, “well, if they're on our side, why aren't they fighting for us? %$* 89
” well, the fact is they are fighting for us. %$* 89
more than 250,000 afghans are in the afghan security forces. %$* 89
only about 30,000 or even fewer are in the taliban. %$* 89
ten times more are fighting on the side of the government. %$* 89
and those numbers are increasing. %$* 89
so i urge you to stand with the brave people of afghanistan to resist the tyranny they hate and that will threaten us if the taliban should ever return to power. %$* 89
thank you, max boot. %$* 13
“afghanistan is a lost cause” is our motion. %$* 13
we are hearing closing statements. %$* 13
and now to issue his closing statement for the motion, matthew hoh, who is the director of the afghanistan study group and a former state department official. %$* 13
thanks, john. %$* 88
i've been doing counterinsurgency all my adult life. %$* 88
before the wars, i was stationed in okinawa, japan. %$* 88
we used to go and work with our counterparts in thailand and philippines and indonesia who are all fighting active insurgencies. %$* 88
i've been doing this. %$* 88
this is not the same as those insurgencies. %$* 88
it's not the same as iraq. %$* 88
what we are involved in, what we're entangled in is a 30-year-old civil war that has roots that go well before the existence of al-qaeda. %$* 88
we also have to-- %$* 88
and again, what i just said there was al-qaeda. %$* 88
what effect are we having on al-qaeda? %$* 88
how is this making america safer? %$* 88
and that's the question that you need to go home with tonight. %$* 88
and to be honest, you know, i'm probably the worst debater you've ever had because i really don't care who wins the debate because at the end of the night, we're all going home. %$* 88
but there's a hundred thousand marines, soldiers, sailors and airmen who are in afghanistan who, you know, it's not theoretical to them. %$* 88
you know, this kid named lieutenant robert kelly who was killed just yesterday. %$* 88
his family is not having a hypothetical debate on these issues. %$* 88
this is very real for a lot of people. %$* 88
and it's something that, when you go home tonight, keep in mind, and keep thinking about it, and keep talking about it. %$* 88
you know the percentage of people who voted on this issue in the midterms? %$* 88
less than eight percent. %$* 88
so these guys all have great books, and i encourage you to go and read their books. %$* 88
and i encourage you to do your research on your own on this and to talk about it with your friends and neighbors, because, like i said, we go home tonight, there are a hundred 100,000 american soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines who are not going home tonight, and some of them will never go home. %$* 88
so just please keep that in mind. %$* 88
thank you, matthew hoh. %$* 13
our motion is "afghanistan is a lost cause." and now summarizing his position against the motion, peter bergen, a journalist and co-director of the new america foundation's counterterrorism strategy initiative. %$* 13
i'd also like you to think about the 3,000 families who didn't have anybody come home on the night of september 11th. %$* 91
and that's just as important a sacrifice and it's something we cannot let happen again. %$* 91
and i'd also like you to think about the history of afghanistan. %$* 91
think about the soviet invasion that killed a million afghans and made five million of them homeless. %$* 91
that was a lost cause. %$* 91
think about the civil war where hundreds of thousands or more afghans then died. %$* 91
that was a lost cause. %$* 91
think about the taliban. %$* 91
i don't need to detain you with what they did to the country. %$* 91
that was a lost cause. %$* 91
it's not surprising that 68 percent of afghans have a favorable view of the u.s.military and 42 percent of them blame the violence in the country on the taliban and only three percent on nato and the united states because they well understand what a catastrophe it would be for the taliban to come back. %$* 91
70 percent of afghans have a favorable view of the future. %$* 91
they know what they're living through is better than anything in the last 30 years. %$* 91
they don't think it's a lost cause. %$* 91
don't take our word for it. %$* 91
think about what they think about as they go to work without having the taliban ruling over them in a brutal and incompetent method every day. %$* 91
thank you, peter bergen. %$* 13
our motion is "afghanistan is a lost cause," and summarizing his position for the motion, arguing that afghanistan is a lost cause, nir rosen, journalist and author of "aftermath: following the bloodshed of america's wars in the muslim world." %$* 13
peter said that the refugees from iran and pakistan have gone home. %$* 90
they've gone home because iran and pakistan expelled them from there so they could go back to afghanistan. %$* 90
he also said that washington, d.c.is more dangerous. %$* 90
it's true in a certain sense. %$* 90
you may be killed by criminals there. %$* 90
but there's no insurgency there. %$* 90
it's not the police and the state that are being attacked in d.c. as they are in afghanistan where there is just no-- %$* 90
you cannot have a state in most of the country these days because they're being undermined. %$* 90
and a white person like peter cannot walk in most of afghanistan without being kidnapped by criminals or killed by the taliban or just held for ransom. %$* 90
we're destabilizing pakistan, a key country with nuclear weapons and a rivalry with india, much more dangerous and much more problematic than afghanistan. %$* 90
we're even doing counterinsurgency in pakistan these days. %$* 90
in kandahar it's just going back to massive military sweeps using a warlord, not the afghan army, a warlord who in the past has pushed people into the hands of the taliban. %$* 90
al-qaeda-- %$* 90
you've never had an afghan, except for one guy, ever try to attack americans, and that's zazi. %$* 90
so you don't have any kind of history of afghan taliban trying to attack the u.s., they're a very local nationalist group, obviously very retrograde. %$* 90
in fact, this is what’s so depressing with the situation. %$* 90
we’ve managed to make in the eyes of many afghans the taliban look good, this is how incompetent we’ve been until now. %$* 90
this is not the first surge, this is the fifth surge. %$* 90
we keep on trying more and more of the same thing. %$* 90
the generals are begging, "just give us a little bit more time." so far there’s no sign that it’s working. %$* 90
why would you trust them? %$* 90
i mean, they have a history of lying. %$* 90
petraeus in 2004 wrote a letter to the "washington post" talking about how great the iraqi security forces were. %$* 90
just a few months later they were involved in brutal attacks against the iraqi population. %$* 90
finally, if you want to defeat al-qaeda, you have to at some point address the grievances. %$* 90
we’re supporting dictatorships throughout the middle east, we’re backing israel blindly, there are specific reasons why there are people in the muslim world who resent the u.s.or you could ignore it and say, "okay, we want to have cheap oil. %$* 90
we want to be this empire that supports dictatorships in pakistan, egypt, saudi arabia." as a result of that, though, you’re always going to have a small group of people who are going to want to seek revenge unless we change who we are at some point. %$* 90
thank you nir rosen. %$* 13
and that concludes our closing statements. %$* 13
and now it’s time to find out which side in your judgment has argued best. %$* 13
we’re going to ask you once again to go to the keypad at your seat and register your vote. %$* 13
and we’re going to get the readout almost immediately. %$* 13
press number one if you’re for the motion "afghanistan is a lost cause." press number two if you’re against. %$* 13
and press number three if you’re undecided-- %$* 13
you came undecided or remain undecided. %$* 13
and we’re going to have the results actually almost instantaneously. %$* 13
while the results are being tabulated i just want to thank you in our audience for your comments and for your questions and for your participation. %$* 13
i also want to thank these four panelists, all of whom have been in afghanistan and know of which they speak. %$* 13
they came here with sharp disagreements, but they honored the spirit of debate by honoring one another by hearing them-- %$* 13
each other's arguments out. %$* 13
our congratulations to them for what they did. %$* 13
the last debate of our fall season is going to be on monday, november 22.the motion is: u.s.airports should use racial and religious profiling. %$* 13
panelists for this motion are robert baer, a former cia agent who was based in the middle east. %$* 13
his book “see no evil” inspired the movie “syriana.” deroy murdock is a syndicated columnist and a fellow at the hoover institution and asra nomani, a former wall street journal reporter and co-director of the daniel perl project. %$* 13
against the motion, debora burlingame, whose brother was the pilot of the american airlines flight 77 which crashed into the pentagon on september 11th. %$* 13
michael chertoff, the former secretary of homeland security and hassan abbas a columbia university professor and a former official in the benazir bhutto and pervez musharraf administrations. %$* 13
tickets for this are still on sale, available through our website and at the box office upstairs at the skirball center. %$* 13
and don’t forget to follow intelligence squared u.s.on twitter and to make sure you become a fan of us on facebook. %$* 13
if you do, you’ll get a discount on our upcoming debates. %$* 13
starting on january 11, we’re going to be focusing all of the debates on a single theme through our spring season. %$* 13
all five debates will be related under this umbrella topic of “america, a house divided.” we’ll be looking at the two-party political system, our declining global influence, energy policy, immigration reform and income inequality. %$* 13
we’re still working on the exact language of the motions and booking the debaters. %$* 13
all of our debates though, including this one and the sound of your own applause, can be heard starting next week-- %$* 13
on npr stations across the nation and on the bloomberg television network, starting next monday, on bloomberg at 9 p.m. %$* 13
and if you visit bloomberg.com you can find out where to get that on your local channel. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
it’s all in now. %$* 13
i’ve been given the final numbers. %$* 13
remember, the team that changes the most minds here is declared the victor and here it is. %$* 13
our motion: america is a lost cause. %$* 13
before the debate, 46 percent were for the motion. %$* 13
america’s a lost cause? %$* 13
i-- %$* 13
you know, i want to talk about washington being a lost cause and it got me thinking. %$* 13
thank you so much for your laughter and helping me to edit this. %$* 13
our motion: afghanistan is a lost cause. %$* 13
before the debate, 46 percent were for the motion, 23 percent were against, 31 percent undecided. %$* 13
after the debate, 51 percent are for the motion, that’s up five percent, 36 percent against, that’s up 13 percent, with 13 percent undecided. %$* 13
the side against the motion carries this debate. %$* 13
our congratulations to them. %$* 13
thank you from me, john donvan and intelligence squared u.s. we’ll see you next time. %$* 13

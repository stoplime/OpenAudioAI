and the news operations were little cogs in these enterprises. %$* 134
and many of these are newspapers but there are strong msm operations, which have a capacity, which phil spoke to for example, on access, freedom of information. %$* 134
on sending journalists around the world, sending journalists around this country, and funding them. %$* 134
nonprofit funding of journalism was about $128 million between 2005 into 2009.that’s one major newsroom. %$* 134
their for-profit models are very small at the moment, and i think all of these foundations and all of the people looking at new models, want to build on elements of the msm, i spoke of propublica. %$* 134
a group in washington founded by david bennahum. %$* 134
the independent. %$* 134
he monitors the impact of his website, by how his stories, his reporters get picked up in the mainstream media— %$* 134
go to michael wolff, what do you make of that, it’s basically an argument that somebody will step up and reach into his own pockets and pay for it. %$* 13
katrina. %$* 131
you reach into your pocket, you pay for the nation. %$* 131
and— %$* 131
i thought you were talking about rupert for a moment, michael— %$* 134
and, and this is— well, rupert— %$* 131
in fact that’s, in fact— %$* 134
—rupert—rupert— %$* 131
—if i could interrupt, that’s not fair— %$* 134
—reaches into many, many pockets to do %$* 131
the nation has a circle— %$* 134
but katrina, let him— %$* 13
no, could i just say we are— %$* 134
—katrina, katrina— %$* 13
—the old model, reader-supported— %$* 134
katrina, please let him speak. %$* 13
well, but you’re supported by a foundation, i don’t know about what—how much comes from your pocket or your family’s pocket but you’re really not talking about the media business, you’re not talking about journalism, you’re talking about a philanthropy, which is great, and that’s another conversation that we might have, but if you’re talking about a robust, self- supporting, profit-making, entrepreneurial, live, real, continuing reason for being business, that’s something different. %$* 131
now in your—everything you’ve said is incredibly noble, and it’s good, i wish it would happen, but it’s not the media business. %$* 131
and maybe you’re not a part of the media business which i would argue that you’re not. %$* 131
that you do something else. %$* 131
but the proposition is about the media business. %$* 131
it’s the mainstream media is actually at various times, it’s been the biggest business in this country. %$* 131
and you’re talking about something that is you know, worthy but not really, the discussion— %$* 131
phil bronstein i see getting ready to respond? %$* 13
well first of all i mean i think that it’s really, the issue is not %$* 132
what do we think of plans b through z.i think we might all agree that there are interesting plans in there somewhere in that alphabet soup. %$* 132
the proposition here is getting rid of a.not the plans b through z.and i think john hockenberry created a bit of a false case, money case. %$* 132
the issue really isn’t about, are these capitalist organizations. %$* 132
evil capitalist organizations. %$* 132
they must make money and they go against the grain of the great passion of journalism. %$* 132
believe me, to be at a newspaper these days you have to be passionate because, you’re like the guy in the l’il abner cartoon with the cloud over his head all the time. %$* 132
the point i tried to—i wanted to make about money was, that you needed to be able to sustain that kinda journalism, propublica has a three-year, $10 million-a-year grant essentially from a single family. %$* 132
is that going to continue? %$* 132
what happens if propublica writes about that family— %$* 132
but phil, phil, john’s argument— %$* 13
look, wait, wait a minute— %$* 135
—john also made the argument— %$* 13
—here, here’s the problem, here’s the problem with that. %$* 135
i mean, okay, there’s a lot of moaning and handwringing about what’s going away and it—that somehow new media is ending the old media, well no, we’re in a transformational moment, things are ending and other things are beginning. %$* 135
where you don’t go, and this is surprising to me. %$* 135
are you arguing for an explicit protected subsidy of these media divisions, of these news divisions of these organizations where, somehow in the federal tax code they’re going to be permitted some status, some subsidy that’s going to allow them to survive because we’ve decided, that it’s constitutionally important to maintain these businesses? %$* 135
you don’t argue that— %$* 135
you don’t argue that. %$* 135
david carr— %$* 13
you say we can’t let it go away— %$* 136
david carr— %$* 13
but—but john, do you disagree then with george washington who did subsidize the distribution of newspapers, the founding fathers were very explicit, that the government had a role— %$* 134
then why didn’t you argue that there— %$* 131
—in regulatory policy, tax policy— %$* 134
but george washington was on your side. %$* 131
i’m sorry— %$* 134
why didn’t—why didn’t you argue that up there if george washington was on your side? %$* 131
because it’s a young crowd— %$* 133
that’s not what you said. %$* 131
geor—i’m talking about— i think this debate should not be about business models, it should be about, how do we salvage and revive— %$* 134
but, but— %$* 131
—using elements of the mainstream media— %$* 134
—but katrina, it could only be not about business models— %$* 131
quality of journalism— %$* 134
—because you’re not— %$* 131
excuse me— %$* 13
—you’re not in a business. %$* 131
i am in the business, michael— %$* 134
well, this is, if you— %$* 131
michael, michael and katrina— %$* 13
if you don’t think i’m in the business— %$* 134
michael—mic—katrina and michael— i need you to alternate. %$* 13
so— i’ll be directing traffic for the next minute. %$* 13
michael. %$* 13
make your point again because i don’t think you could be heard. %$* 13
and then katrina, you’ll come back. %$* 13
well, the, katrina’s point is to remove this from a business discussion. %$* 131
in other words, and let’s be clear about what she’s saying, she’s saying, this is about journalists, this is about what journalists want. %$* 131
this is live having the health care debate decided just by doctors. %$* 131
it’s not true. %$* 131
i mean it doesn’t work that way. %$* 131
nothing works this way, except if you want to just sequester something and make it part of— i don’t know, maybe a university— %$* 131
okay, katrina, come back to this— %$* 13
you know, you know, let me jump in— %$* 136
david, david, just a second, i gave—told katrina she would get next to— %$* 13
she gave—she gave %$* 136
i gave him my proxy— %$* 134
then—then david carr, it’s yours. %$* 13
the—let’s take these hardcore business guys at their word, over here, okay— %$* 136
public radio, david. %$* 135
the,— the %$* 136
let’s just think about what they’re doing, katrina is apparently guilty of running a magazine that doesn’t make money. %$* 136
newser is an interesting model which involves either imitation or theft of other material depending on which— politico— %$* 136
or abbreviation of stuff, of david carr stories which are vastly too long, who’s the last— %$* 131
okay— %$* 136
—who read a full david carr— %$* 131
good one. %$* 136
good one, have any of you— %$* 136
back to you, david carr. %$* 13
have any of you ever read michael in vanity fair? %$* 136
every word— %$* 136
i take that— %$* 131
—a shining diamond, anyways— these guys %$* 136
these guys are saying, your business is over, we’re the new crowd. %$* 136
their models are completely and totally untested, with the exception of john, public radio has been an amazing model that’s produced an enormous amount of journalism. %$* 136
but it’s not a for-profit model— %$* 136
if our models are— %$* 131
michael— %$* 13
can new media fact-check mainstream media for a second, because there are profitable models, politico in its third year, 120 employees— %$* 133
what about the money— %$* 136
—come on david, david— %$* 133
—that went in. %$* 136
david— profitable. %$* 133
doing serious nonpartisan journalism. %$* 133
the huffington post which you can argue is partially aggregator, is not profitable now but if you look at its traffic which this month surpassed the washington post, if they weren’t in a heavy investment mode, could probably be profitable. %$* 133
what you’re also forgetting to know, to note, is that it’s early, we’re all trying to figure out the business model, we haven’t even started to charge for content. %$* 133
trust me, people, you’re going to be paying for content a lot of it is going to be new media content, and i think the whole argument over here is, we’re not saying get rid of mainstream media altogether, we’re saying, get rid of it, get rid of it the way you’ve been! %$* 133
the reason you guys are arguing that you survive or that people should vote with you is that by adopting all of our techniques, by get—the speed, the transparency, the openness, the twitter, all of the things that are thriving in new media, that’s—we’re equipping some of the mainstream media institutions, to have at least a chance of survival and there aren’t that many— %$* 133
jim, do you think they’re on your side without knowing it? %$* 13
pardon, i think they are, i do think they’re on our side without knowing it. %$* 133
and i think they would privately concede that they’re on our side. %$* 133
but i can’t tell the difference— %$* 135
john hockenberry— %$* 13
—between %$* 135
i can’t tell the difference between, are you arguing that your institution should be maintained as they are now, or are you simply saying, i want to know i have a job when the new york times goes under. %$* 135
i mean is that the argument. %$* 135
because the latter one i’m not interested in. %$* 135
the former one i am interested in, of course there are things about the new york times, and there are qualities of the mainstream media that we want preserved. %$* 135
they aren’t the core of those businesses— %$* 135
well, the— %$* 136
—and the strategy for making those businesses profitable is not to do more of that, as we’ve amply demonstrated, they do less of that now— %$* 135
but we do want some of the qualities preserved, and that is why we are against “good riddance to the mainstream”— %$* 134
yeah, “good riddance” is not— %$* 136
luckily they are—they have been preserved, there’s a lot of new media institutions that have the same values of fairness, of— same values of accountability. %$* 135
and thank god for it— %$* 135
but you’re— %$* 134
—and that’s where the growth is— %$* 32
there are old mainstream organizations— %$* 134
that’s where the innovation is— the innovation in the industry is coming— %$* 32
let me address— %$* 13
—from new media, the innovation about business models, about the type of journalism, about the ways that we can use technology to make journalism a lot more accessible to all of you, to give all of you guys input into—to journalism, and i think it’s a much better thing, like i hate the pessimism that i see, in the mainstream media about what’s happening, this is a great time, it’s a great time if you want to be a journalist, it’s a great time if you’re a news consumer, because there’s more information than you could’ve ever asked for, and a lot of it is coming from where? %$* 32
from us, not from them— %$* 32
phil bronstein. %$* 13
let me just say here is how— %$* 135
john, john, john, let me just get to the other side, phil bronstein, please. %$* 13
well i hate the pessimism too. %$* 132
but john hockenberry, john made a very eloquent case about the first amendment a few minutes ago, and he and i were together earlier today and i mentioned the balco case, or, the problems that came up in the balco case with the government, and he said well, at least we have the first amendment, or we have the first amendment, something to that effect. %$* 132
and the reality is the first amendment did not help us when alberto gonzalez was the attorney general. %$* 132
the first amendment did not help us as that administration, the previous administration went circuit court by federal circuit court, to take away the rights of reporters to maintain the confidentiality of their sources and do their job. %$* 132
the first amendment didn’t mean anything in that circumstance. %$* 132
and so, we’re all great believers in the first amendment, i would assume. %$* 132
but it really required years of hard work, years of struggle, and millions and millions of dollars, for newspapers whether it’s the san francisco chronicle or the new york times or the washington post, or the riverside press enterprise, to make sure that the government was held accountable, to the notion of the first amendment, that there was a first amendment and that there would be people fighting for it. %$* 132
so, i think that was a false sort of argument to make about the first amendment, i think the argument is very different— %$* 132
john hockenberry, you want to come back on this— %$* 13
sadly you used the worst case for endorsing the mainstream media. %$* 135
the war was endorsed by the mainstream media in the united states, the war in iraq was the worst moment of the mainstream media in the united states, similar to the— %$* 135
alberto gonzales period. %$* 135
these were aspects of the bush administration that were not questioned by the mainstream media, it was only much, much later, that the media stepped in and questioned those points. %$* 135
alberto gonzalez— %$* 132
and indeed— %$* 135
—the mainstream media apologized for its endorsement of both the war and some of the tactics of the bush administration, long after the fact. %$* 135
the idea that you were on the front lines of being accountable to the government run amok under the bush administration, is just completely at odds with the facts— %$* 135
so to maintain mainstream media you would like us to be perfect. %$* 132
no, no, no, i’m not saying that, i’m just saying— %$* 135
you’re saying we have flaws and we’ve agreed we have flaws— %$* 132
—you’re picking the wrong period of time to win a trophy for. %$* 135
we—you’re saying we have flaws, we agree we have flaws— %$* 132
what would you know about the conduct of the war in afghanistan right now, you as citizens, you as a broadcaster, absent mainstream reporting. %$* 136
who has boots on the ground— %$* 136
david, david, the prob— %$* 131
what—just say— %$* 136
you’re absolutely right— %$* 131
—what is twitter, going to tell you about what’s going on in afghanistan. %$* 136
michael wolff— %$* 13
we—yeah, no—david, i think the better question is, don’t we feel that we don’t know what’s going on in afghanistan, this war has been going on for— jesus christ. %$* 131
and suddenly, suddenly, suddenly we wake up and we find, oh my god, we’re losing the war! %$* 131
where has the new york times been— %$* 131
how did you know that— %$* 136
—the new york times has not told me, we’re losing the war %$* 131
jesus christ, david, that is the worst excuse, it’s afghanistan— %$* 131
—where we are dying. %$* 131
afghanistan, we have had people there doing rigorous reporting that %$* 136
oh yeah, really rigorous— %$* 131
but michael, i mean— %$* 134
—you know— %$* 136
—i can’t— %$* 134
jesus— %$* 131
i can’t believe— %$* 134
—this is appalling— %$* 131
—i’m going to defend the new york times but let me do that on this case because i do think, the reporting around the corruption of the karzai government and the run-off, contributed in some measure to a public waking up and the fact that a majority of americans now oppose this war, and if i could, in between %$* 134
the iraq war and afghanistan, or at a certain point around iraq, how would we have learned about the torture sites, the black sites, rendition, abu ghraib %$* 134
yeah, we— %$* 131
those were the— %$* 134
we’re not saying— %$* 131
—those were the strong elements— %$* 134
—of reporting— %$* 134
there are some— %$* 131
—in the mainstream. %$* 134
yeah, there are stories here. %$* 131
but this is— actually maybe one of the things i’m, i do this a lot, i go around the country and i talk about the end of newspapers and one of the things that invariably comes up, let’s see if it comes up here is the boston globe and its investigation of abuses in the catholic church, and everybody goes well, what would happen with that. %$* 131
and i thought about this for a long time and i—then i thought %$* 131
well, where was the boston globe for the 30 years this was going on? %$* 131
and, this is one of those things, yes, we know. %$* 131
but we know too late, nobody, nobody should get an award here. %$* 131
this is not, this is not what—you shouldn’t say, oh, we’re really proud of our coverage in iraq and afghanistan. %$* 131
my god, it’s a dollar late, whatever that— %$* 131
so michael, that’s your view of the boston globe— that’s your view of the boston globe coverage of pederasty in the catholic church is that, it was useless because it was late? %$* 132
well, for god’s sake, yes, you can’t always defend yourself like this— %$* 131
michael, are you serious, you’re saying yes, that it’s better—not better late than never? %$* 13
no, i’m saying you did your job poorly, we did our jobs poorly— %$* 131
but the job, the job— %$* 132
—that’s the job that should—no, you can’t do that, you can’t say, oh yes, well we came in finally, we got it in the end. %$* 131
we got it, 30 years it took us to get it— %$* 131
but i think their argument is that nobody else did, ever— %$* 13
yeah, yeah— %$* 136
—until they came in. %$* 13
wait, wait, wait, wait— %$* 136
no. %$* 131
they are missing the point. %$* 131
nobody else did because, in this case the boston globe was in the pocket of the archdiocese, they stood right in the way of that story. %$* 131
they blocked that story. %$* 131
those are the guys who should go to jail. %$* 131
david carr— %$* 13
big powerful institutions in government, in business, need big, powerful institutions in opposition of them, exxon %$* 136
big tobacco, exxon, the current white house, the last white house. %$* 136
how would you know that we’re using remote robotic airplanes in a systematic way, to go into pakistan right now, with the cia’s finger on the trigger— %$* 136
okay, david, we get the point of your question and it’s a good one— %$* 13
yeah— %$* 135
—let’s let take—john hockenberry take that— %$* 13
look, we are off the proposition. %$* 135
totally off the proposition. %$* 135
there would be total agreement on this stage %$* 135
possibly not with michael. %$* 135
but— if the proposition was, “good riddance to journalism.” no one is saying that. %$* 135
i would not participate on a panel that said “good riddance to journalism.” %$* 135
oh yeah, i would. %$* 131
the main—right, there we go. %$* 135
i know my colleagues. %$* 135
what we are talking about is good riddance to a business model, that has a mixed record on the kinds of virtues that david carr is talking about. %$* 135
that is now going down the tubes for reasons that have to do with an economic transformation that is both productive and useful, and the idea of the baby being thrown out with the bathwater, that there is no alternative, jim amply demonstrates that the alternative is emerging. %$* 135
if it’s with partnerships with the mainstream media so be it, but it is a good thing, vote with the proposition. %$* 135
i want to— %$* 13
—go to the audience for some questions now, and what we’re going to do is bring up the lights, and %$* 13
microphones will travel, and i’m shading my eyes because i still can’t quite see. %$* 13
there’s a woman in the seventh row up with your hand up, if you put two hands up everybody—i know it’s an odd thing to do but, now they can find you. %$* 13
and we want to ask anybody who is a member of the media or a blogger, to identify them—so let’s say if you’re an a-list blogger, to identify yourselves, so you— you can self-select on that one. %$* 13
ma’am, your question, please. %$* 13
and, question rules. %$* 13
yes, of course, thank you, i do work for a public radio station in washington d.c.i cut my teeth on investigative journalism. %$* 137
i’m not quite so sure i really care about the delivery system, whether it’s a blog, a newspaper, a television story. %$* 137
of all the models we’ve talked about tonight, i’d like to hear the panelists debate the best delivery system for really deep investigative journalism, i think of everything that’s really missing in our media today. %$* 137
all right, and phil bronstein has argued that it takes very deep pockets, john hockenberry, to do exactly what that questioner is asking about, the very deep kind of journalism. %$* 13
and you actually argued the opposite, that having deep pockets leads to terrible conflicts of interest. %$* 13
take that question. %$* 13
well i would say that the deep pockets that supported one investigative series, which i applaud, was also used for other purposes, for the other 364 days of the year, so, the deep pockets are used for various things at various times. %$* 135
you—if you exist under the illusion that the deep pockets merely support investigative journalism, then you’re really supporting our point here. %$* 135
obviously we support and endorse the virtues of investigative journalism that holds institutions to account. %$* 135
but to say that the only delivery system for that is newspapers financed by shareholders in a corporate model, is to really ignore the present moment. %$* 135
i think newspapers do a great job. %$* 135
i think politico.com does a great job. %$* 135
i think any one individual platform is not the model. %$* 135
and i think what we’re talking about here is a proliferation of platforms being a good thing, a transformational moment. %$* 135
and if it makes some very, very well- paid people in the mainstream media worried, then, you know, that’s the kind of worry that we journalists cut our teeth on it seems to me. %$* 135
phil bronstein? %$* 13
yeah, and we’ve heard a lot from our opponents tonight about, “you will hear from the other side,” and we really, you haven’t heard a lotta those things that they say you’ll hear from us. %$* 132
and i mean first of all, john hockenberry just said a minute ago, if we could roll back the tape-- %$* 132
i’d suggest we do it. %$* 132
if it’s in partnership with mainstream media, so be it, meaning the future. %$* 132
well, there goes their side of the argument. %$* 132
because, if mainstream media is good riddanced, then there’s no partnership with mainstream media to be had. %$* 132
i don’t know what the other purposes john was talking about, the 364 days a year, it sounds like, you know, we’re cutting people’s shoes off those other %$* 132
the rest of the year. %$* 132
but i don’t believe, i mean—the quote when i went up to the podium was, you know, you said to your newsroom, the business model’s broken and no one knows how to fix it yet, so %$* 132
i’m not making the case for the business model, and i am not making the case that that top- down, vertical kind of mass medium is really the only model. %$* 132
i don’t know that you’ve heard anyone from this side say it’s the only model which is the phrase that john just used. %$* 132
gent— %$* 13
i would like to hear how your side is going to support yourself at some point. %$* 131
gentleman in the fourth row? %$* 13
we’re going to get vc’s just like you, mike. %$* 136
no, i— %$* 131
all right— %$* 13
—will get vc’s, you won’t. %$* 131
let’s respect our audience member. %$* 13
sir. %$* 13
thank you first of all to all the panelists, we’ve heard a lot about what is purportedly wrong with mainstream media. %$* 130
i’d like to hear a little bit about what might be wrong with new media, and also some comment on the recent calls from the regulators on regulating new media, bloggers and so forth disclosing what they receive from corporations, and how the new media, this nascent institution if you will, might evolve and what we need to watch out for if anything. %$* 130
that was a question. %$* 13
yes. %$* 13
katrina, would you like to take it? %$* 13
i’m—yeah, you can %$* 134
david carr— %$* 13
part of the problem that goes on on the web, and there are so many wonderful examples of brand build-out on the web, the huffington post, i’ve never encountered anything like it in my media career, watched something explode like that. %$* 136
jim’s ability to take reporters who have worked elsewhere and just start breaking stories right away, has just been breathtaking to watch as a media reporter. %$* 136
that’s the exception, not the rule. %$* 136
out on the web, people assemble into verticals of self-interest. %$* 136
they often speak only to each other. %$* 136
they become an echo chamber of half-truths, sometimes outright lies, without any real data points coming in. %$* 136
and so you end up with a sort of mass of people talking to each other, no one has read anything. %$* 136
no one knows anything. %$* 136
they’re talking about something that someone else read that read that read that read. %$* 136
and we end up in a meta-world. %$* 136
the people that i follow on twitter always include a link to what they’re talking about. %$* 136
the blogs that i follow, and politico is a great example of this, live in the ecosystem of blogs, so you have transparency to what they’re talking and why they’re talking about it. %$* 136
you can look into the database. %$* 136
but there isn’t a lot of it going on. %$* 136
as these guys have said themselves, it’s a very nascent state. %$* 136
in the mainstream media, and the blogosphere, are—we’ve adopted the tools of the insurgency in terms of presentation, going to the web, or afghanistan reporting as video, as maps, where the drug lords are, blogs in real time of what’s going on. %$* 136
at the same time, you have new media adopting standards, reporting, approaches, starting to beef up. %$* 136
i think the two are coming together. %$* 136
jim vandehei, sounds like again you’re agreeing— %$* 13
well we just—we keep hearing about that, you were just talking a little bit about the echo chamber like it’s just noise and people are amplifying positions that they already have and there’s a lot of misinformation out there. %$* 133
but who’s doing the fact-checking, some of the best fact-checking’s being done by new media. %$* 133
factcheck.org, which i think is the name of the arm of the st. %$* 133
petersburg times which won a pulitzer prize for its fact- checking—that online, that new media component made the old media relevant, who’s been fact-checking, who was quickest to fact-check the death panels and all the other nonsense that we’ve had in different debates in recent months. %$* 133
it’s websites like ours, it’s the huffington post. %$* 133
it’s various bloggers who are checking this stuff in real time, and they’re setting the record straight, and i think that that’s a fabulous, advance. %$* 133
is there a bigger burden on you as the reader right now than there was, 10 years ago, when five people at the three big networks and the two big newspapers told you how to view world events? %$* 133
yes. %$* 133
but i think there’s so much more information now for you to consume, thanks to new media, that you’re a much more educated consumer of news and you can make probably a much, a better decision based on the facts. %$* 133
right, there was a second part to that question about regulation of the new media, and i’m sure you’re against it. %$* 13
so i’m going to— %$* 13
i mean i’m— %$* 131
—move on, to— %$* 13
i mean—yeah, i mean i’m against regulation and i’m against any, any government funding for, for journalists— %$* 131
gentleman— %$* 13
—i think it needs to be— %$* 131
needs to be attached to a robust business model. %$* 131
jacket, tie, eyeglasses, and two hands up. %$* 13
can’t use the two hands up trick everywhere. %$* 13
i’m the— %$* 137
oh, i’m sorry, i actually was going to the gentleman behind you, and i’ll come back to you, ma’am. %$* 13
as a consumer i— %$* 130
can you stand, please? %$* 13
yeah, as a consumer i think one of the values that i see in mainstream media is comprehension of coverage where you can look at a source, and really understand what’s going on in the world. %$* 130
and i worry that socially, how does media, if that goes away and there’s not funding for that breadth of coverage, what’s the social impact of that, if we all move to new media, certain verticals where people just choose %$* 130
to read what they want to read and they’re not exposed to all these other things. %$* 130
john hockenberry, why don’t you take that. %$* 13
well, again, i think what is the argument there, do we preserve an institution and do we choose which newspapers are worthy of having this subsidy to maintain their position? %$* 135
and then are we to call them independent? %$* 135
are we to say that because now they are supported by the government, they’re supported by some sort of tax on say, television or internet service providers that that revenue now flowing to those institutions makes them secure and independent in some sense that’s going to make the journalism better? %$* 135
no, i think what you’ve done there is create a jobs program for some great journalists and, let’s hope they stick around. %$* 135
but if they leave, there’s absolutely no guarantee that the virtues that you talk about that are associated with the brand of those institutions, is going to remain. %$* 135
what— the only thing— %$* 135
but john, do you—do you agree with the premise of the question that, that the new media tends toward people %$* 13
seeking out views that they know they already agree with? %$* 13
but i think the mainstream media is at least as guilty of that as anything in the blogsphere, i mean it is the fox news network i believe that created a theme park out of a conspiracy of liberals taking over the world. %$* 135
and— and so i think that model has worked for newspapers, as well as it’s worked for blogs, it’s certainly nothing that was invented by the huffington post. %$* 135
i’m just— %$* 134
katrina— %$* 13
—i’m thinking of a news story in the las vegas sun, which was a six-month project by a paper which wasn’t that well-funded but, part of the mainstream media, may have been a chain. %$* 134
and it was a journalist who covered what unaccountable officials had not covered, what the labor unions had averted their eyes to. %$* 134
and she uncovered %$* 134
deaths. %$* 134
accidental deaths of about 30 workers. %$* 134
and what she did with her reporting over a sustained period of time, and i think it would’ve been difficult to do though i’m all over many platforms, and i’m for hybrid. %$* 134
but people aren’t reading sustained, comprehensive series, on the web, in a new media way. %$* 134
and what she did was save lives. %$* 134
and i think that is— %$* 134
but why couldn’t the web very quickly adapt to that sort of model? %$* 13
well, i think, that, in a different instance— i mean again a sustained series over the course of a year, by nina bernstein of the new york times, she not only had her newspaper behind her in filing foia’s which lawyers didn’t have the funding to do, this is on immigration detention. %$* 134
soi think, she had the support of the funding, which is difficult in these untested models of new media %$* 134
even propublica as i said earlier, wants to get its stories in what you would consider the mainstream media, high- quality investigative journalism that exposes wrongs, corrects and reforms. %$* 134
i think the new media, and i don’t want to sound retro because i think we want a hybrid, we want a healthy journalism. %$* 134
but i think it’s tougher to do those kinds of things now, on the web. %$* 134
people are doing politico, they’re doing quick takes, they’re doing quick stories. %$* 134
but it’s rare to find people who are reading long investigative series %$* 134
okay, the questioner i asked— %$* 13
—on the web— %$* 134
—to wait before, ma’am—? %$* 13
—and it doesn’t have the impact in some way, i’m sorry, because of the institutional authority, historically, which may change and is changing slowly, but not yet, of a new york times taking on a scandal, and pushing for reform which in my view is what public interest-watchdog-accountability journalism is about. %$* 134
ma’am, your question. %$* 13
yeah, i’m the general counsel of the hearst corporation and 20 minutes ago the houston chronicle sued the governor of texas for failing to turn over a clemency report, which a source told us contained information that the person they killed today was innocent. %$* 137
my question to you all is, how many lawsuits are you aware of that, let’s call it new media, has brought on behalf of the public interest for important information. %$* 137
jim vandehei. %$* 13
we applaud what the houston paper is doing, we applaud what the las vegas paper is doing, but i think when you decide that you’re going to vote for the proposition, one of the things you have to keep in mind is that it is a false argument to say that this cannot and will not be done by the new media. %$* 133
you were talking about how you recall the— this las vegas series. %$* 133
i recall talking points memo doing a series of pieces on the series of firings of us attorneys under bush and was relentless in doing it, and was—and did a great job of using the technology that new media’s created, to be able to get more documents, get more information and over time, build up a story that forced other people to reckon with and, and got attention and made a difference and i think increasingly— %$* 133
you used a lotta stories from local papers. %$* 132
increasingly— %$* 133
and aggregators— %$* 132
and using a lot of like, the information that’s coming in %$* 133
and you have files in your offices at the chronicle as well, where you clip newspapers from other sources. %$* 131
and you use that as part of your research to develop stories, for heaven’s sakes— %$* 131
right, but i wouldn’t then want to go kill those other sources. %$* 132
david carr %$* 13
david carr. %$* 13
right now in chicago there’s something called the innocence project which is one of these hybrids of student journalists and a coach and they’ve got nearly a dozen people wrongly convicted, off of death row and helped the governor change the policy. %$* 136
this week, new case, prosecutors sensing an opportunity, doesn’t address the issue of whether the person they brought forth is guilty or innocent, says i want your notes. %$* 136
i want your emails. %$* 136
i want all of your reporting materials to prove, whether you got a better grade or not if you got this guy off. %$* 136
again and again %$* 136
you need large, powerful institutions, barnacles attached, to take on large, powerful government forces— %$* 136
michael wolff— %$* 13
—there’s no way around it. %$* 136
michael wolff. %$* 13
just briefly and i think it’s worth pointing out and this is something that people up here are loath to say and people don’t like to say in a, you know, among a polite group here, but, and i like the people at the hearst company. %$* 131
but you put out terrible newspapers and you’ve put out terrible newspapers for at least half a century, so, the question is should we fight to preserve hearst newspapers and again i love the people at hearst and you put out some good magazines, et cetera, et cetera. %$* 131
but i don’t think anyone wants to make the case for hearst newspapers— %$* 131
ma’am, do you— %$* 13
—or for any— %$* 131
do you— %$* 13
—of the chain newspapers— %$* 131
do you feel, ma’am, that your question was answered? %$* 13
no, i was looking for a numeric answer to the question— %$* 137
i’m sorry, repeat— %$* 13
i was looking for a numeric answer to the question, how many lawsuits have you brought in the public interest as part of original reporting, rather than the barnacle %$* 137
pieces that you use, i’m not criticizing it but just curious as to whether or not you’ve put any energy into that. %$* 137
look, we stipulate that new media does not have the track record that the new york times or the houston chronicle has because it is new media. %$* 135
and, and indeed, if the metric is, what have you done for me over the last century, then new media will lose. %$* 135
but what we are talking about is, what have you done for me lately. %$* 135
and i think the question is that over time, mainstream media will have less ability to do what katrina and david and phil are talking about, and new media will have more capacity to do it, and the intent is absolutely there, and the panel has not demonstrated that, for some reason, new media has no interest in the kinds of things you’re talking about it, take katrina’s thing for just one moment. %$* 135
she’s describing how a woman reporter worked for six months on a story that saved lives, and that’s getting more difficult now. %$* 135
i mean, imagine, at a small local paper in new jersey, a reporter goes in to an editor and says, you know, i’ve been working for a month on this story but %$* 135
it’s so difficult, i wish i was working for the new york times. %$* 135
it would be so much easier if i was working for an organization with the deep pockets to support me, what would that editor say? %$* 135
he would say go back and do your story. %$* 135
that’s how journalism works. %$* 135
the idea that this is tough, is not an argument, for them. %$* 135
the idea that it is tough, is an argument for all the journalists who will continue to keep working regardless of whether the new york times or the washington post go away tomorrow or not. %$* 135
yeah, but that’s not even what would happen, if i can argue with people on my own side—side. %$* 131
if they went in, if that person in new jersey went in and said i’ve been working on this for a month and it’s really hard, what would the editor say, the editor would say forget it, okay, it’s over, done with, let’s get on to something else. %$* 131
but you know there are interesting models, again i go back to this reconstruction of american journalism, this is how i spend my evenings when i’m not watching monty python. %$* 134
but, i was— eight newspapers in ohio have come together, to continue the newsroom, the news reporting that that state needs. %$* 134
in new jersey and new york there’s a tristate—i’m sorry, two-state collaboration, so that you can continue some of the reporting, these are mainstream media organizations— %$* 134
i don’t think your opponents are— %$* 133
—trying to navigate their way— %$* 134
i don’t think your opponents are against that. %$* 133
well, they’re mainstream media— %$* 134
we’re just saying that it doesn’t— %$* 133
let me, let me go to another question— %$* 13
i’m saying— %$* 133
and i would just say on the new—in respect to the new media— %$* 134
right there in front— %$* 13
—i was on the hillman media awards, a year before josh marshall got a polk award, and we gave it to him for the attorneys general reporting he did, there are good models. %$* 134
but, that doesn’t mean you throw out %$* 134
the baby with the bathwater. %$* 13
i don’t know, some people over there might want— %$* 134
we have to have an anti-cliché rule. %$* 13
yes. %$* 13
too late. %$* 133
so i think a lot of this conversation has been about capacity capacity to provide %$* 137
good reporting, integrity around reporting, accurate reporting. %$* 137
and i think everyone here would agree that, there’s a lot of respect for places like huffington post and politico.com. %$* 137
that you all have the capacity, or are at least thinking about developing the capacity to provide that quality control. %$* 137
i’m curious about, um, what about the other, all the other mechanisms on the internet that don’t necessarily have the capacity, nor are interested in developing the capacity to provide that quality control. %$* 137
so the twitters, the facebooks, the youtubes where you, you log in to something and they actually say, this is what’s happening, but it’s folks, i had an experience so i downloaded something from youtube— %$* 137
ma’am, cut— %$* 13
sorry, okay, so— %$* 137
—short to the chase, so focus in— %$* 13
—the question is, who has the capacity, and who is going to be responsible, for looking at quality control outside of the places we already know are interested in doing so. %$* 137
what you’re really saying is that there are a lotta crazy people on the internet. %$* 13
a lot—a lot of crazy people. %$* 137
okay, and i think that’s a fair point, because, jim, for example, it’s not all politico.com and i think that’s really her point, that they’re not all playing by your rules, which you brought in with you from the mainstream media. %$* 13
crazy people aren’t a new invention. %$* 133
they’ve been around for a long time, people who tell lies have been around for a long time, people who think crap information is true, have been around for a long time. %$* 133
and i think that %$* 133
what you’re going to see, it does put more of a burden on you, and i’ll keep coming back to this because there is so much information, you have to figure out what you trust. %$* 133
the reason that i’m optimistic is i feel like new media is going to solve that for you, it’s not going to be old media, it’s going to be new models in your local communication, it might not be a paper that has four or five hundred employees. %$* 133
it might be a series of three or four smaller websites that do very specialty reporting in those communities, some might be not-for- profit, some might be ad-supported, some might be paid content. %$* 133
but that’s going to happen. %$* 133
and it’s happening now—that’s why i’m optimistic that together we can figure this out, we are figuring this out. %$* 133
and there’s a reason that mainstream media is losing readers, they lost touch with their readers, there’s a reason, look at the circulation numbers that just came out. %$* 133
across the board they lost 10 percent. %$* 133
some newspapers lost a much higher percent, in six months, they’re just losing the readers because they didn’t retool and they didn’t start trying to get news to you the way that you wanted, maybe you want it on twitter, maybe you want it on facebook, maybe you want it in a newspaper, maybe you want it online. %$* 133
it’s companies like ours and i think companies in new media that are figuring that out and are going to be the ones that continue to provide that and continue to fact-check for you. %$* 133
the pink jacket, ma’am. %$* 13

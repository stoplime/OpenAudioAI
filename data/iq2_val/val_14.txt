it’s at this point wwe like to bring to the stage the chairman of intelligence squared u.s., who actually brought this program to the united states back in 2006.we’re now, i think, on our 88th debate. %$* 13
and so, in tribute to that, and to hear what he has to say because he’s thought about this for us, let’s welcome to the stage, please, mr. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
hey, bob. %$* 13
the quick answer is some shoulder surgery. %$* 13
no, i met this russian guy in a bar, and i described his country as a marginal power. %$* 1
yeah. %$* 13
you don’t want to do that. %$* 13
let’s talk about this word, “marginal power.” you know, we go at these motions. %$* 13
and sometimes, we get into a situation where people are actually debating what the motion is about. %$* 13
we have a specific thing in mind with that. %$* 13
well, in our minds, marginal power is the dichotomy of great power. %$* 1
those are the two opposites. %$* 1
is russia a marginal power? %$* 1
or is it a great power? %$* 1
and i think that that’s what this debate is meant to be about, at least in our heads. %$* 1
and the side that’s arguing for this motion that it’s a marginal power, therefore, not great, what kind of arguments do they have going for them? %$* 13
well, i think their argument would be that russia has marginalized itself in a lot of ways by conducting its foreign policy in a way where it is pretty much isolated from the great powers of the world. %$* 1
so, yes, it may have yanukovych as a friend in ukraine. %$* 1
or it may have assad as a friend in syria. %$* 1
but who wants friend like that? %$* 1
it may be pushing its weight around with its gas exports in europe, but europe is now trying to find alternatives to that kind of reliance. %$* 1
it may be sticking its nose-- %$* 1
sticking its thumb in america’s eye with the way it behaves with snowden, et cetera, but it’s on the verge of losing its status as a g8 member. %$* 1
and it’s really moving itself into the periphery of global-- %$* 1
the global centers of power. %$* 1
which are lots of ways not to count on the global stage. %$* 13
but what about on the other side? %$* 13
what’s the argument that they do count? %$* 13
well, the argument that they do count is that they take the game of geo-politics extremely seriously. %$* 1
and, in contrast to the united states, which seems not really to be playing that game. %$* 1
so, they are very, very interested in expanding their influence in their immediate neighborhood. %$* 1
and they’ve been a success at that. %$* 1
i mean, they’ve certainly succeeded in syria-- %$* 1
in getting their guy entrenched in power. %$* 1
they’ve succeeded in the sense in the ukraine in forestalling the greater unification of ukraine with european institutions. %$* 1
and that they’ve enjoyed a substantial measure of geo-political success. %$* 1
it looks like they’re going to be able to, at minimum, absolutely secure their naval base in sevastopol, but very likely reenacts crimea without any material consequences across. %$* 1
so, they think strategically like a great power. %$* 1
they act like a great power. %$* 1
and they’ve been successful in their initiatives. %$* 1
all right. %$* 13
so, the two sides to the coin-- %$* 13
and one other question. %$* 13
once your shoulder heals, are you going to have a face off again with that guy? %$* 13
you should see how he looks. %$* 1
thank you, bob rosenkranz. %$* 13
and now, let’s bring our debaters to the stage. %$* 13
just want to check. %$* 13
i heard some radio transmission while we were talking. %$* 13
that’s all cleared up? %$* 13
kind of? %$* 13
audio is good? %$* 13
we can launch? %$* 13
well, in that case, let’s do that. %$* 13
and i’d like to start with one more round of applause for bob rosenkranz for bringing these guests. %$* 13
boy, did they matter to us once, back when we thought that they could wipe us out, and that they actually had a plan in place to do that. %$* 13
the russians, i mean. %$* 13
or the soviets, as they were known then. %$* 13
some part of each day, back when they were a superpower, each one of us had to give some thought to what might happen if the men in moscow really got mad. %$* 13
and then, suddenly, it was over-- %$* 13
the cold war. %$* 13
both sides cut up a lot of missiles. %$* 13
we were the one superpower left. %$* 13
the russians-- %$* 13
well, they seemed to matter less, kind of pushed to the side of our consciousness. %$* 13
but now, they are certainly back in it, and in all sorts of ways in different parts of the world, which says what about how much the men in moscow matter now, and how much do we actually need to worry about it? %$* 13
well, that sounds like the makings for a debate. %$* 13
so, let’s have it. %$* 13
yes or no to this statement: russia is a marginal power. %$* 13
a debate from intelligence squared u.s.i’m john donvan. %$* 13
we have four superbly qualified debaters-- %$* 13
two against two-- %$* 13
here at the kaufman music center in new york. %$* 13
they will argue for and against the motion: russia is a marginal power. %$* 13
our debate goes in three rounds. %$* 13
and then, as always, the audience votes to choose the winner. %$* 13
and only one side wins. %$* 13
our motion is this: russia is a marginal power. %$* 13
let’s meet the team arguing for the motion. %$* 13
first, please, let’s welcome ian bremmer. %$* 13
ian, you started early. %$* 13
you traveled to the soviet union when you were 16 years old. %$* 13
you then edited a book on soviet nationalities when you were 22 years old. %$* 13
when you were 28 years old, you founded the eurasia group, a political risk consultancy. %$* 13
so, a lot of precociousness going on there. %$* 13
and, in 2013, you wrote up a list of the world’s most powerful people. %$* 13
you gave the number one spot to nobody. %$* 13
but you gave the number two spot to vladimir putin, which the russian state-controlled media got very, very excited about and took as a compliment. %$* 13
did they get the message right? %$* 13
not entirely. %$* 105
the point being? %$* 13
the point being that putin has become extraordinarily powerful at the expense at the russian people and at the expense of the russian nation. %$* 105
so, not such a compliment. %$* 13
take it as you wish. %$* 105
ladies and gentlemen, ian bremmer. %$* 13
and ian, who is your partner tonight? %$* 13
my partner is the inexplicably charismatic edward lucas. %$* 105
ladies and gentlemen, edward lucas. %$* 13
ed lucas, you are the author of several books. %$* 13
you’re also arguing that russia is a marginal power. %$* 13
your books include “deception,” a book about russian espionage, and “the new cold war,” in which you argue that russia, under vladimir putin, is a danger to itself and to others. %$* 13
you’re also senior editor at the economist, where you served as moscow bureau chief from 1998 to 2002, which puts you in russia really at about the time that putin, essentially, for the rest of us, came out of nowhere to rise to power. %$* 13
we didn’t know much about him back then. %$* 13
but you had a bad feeling early on? %$* 13
yes, there was a clue in the three letters in his resume, which went kgb.and i plenty of experience of them. %$* 106
and i didn’t-- %$* 106
i didn’t like that. %$* 106
it’s a dead giveaway. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, ed lucas. %$* 13
our motion is “russia is a marginal power.” two debaters are arguing against it. %$* 13
first, let’s please welcome robert blackwill. %$* 13
bob blackwill, you are a former deputy national security adviser for president george w.bush. %$* 13
you also served president george h.w.bush as a special assistant for european and soviet affairs from 1989 to 1990.so, you were in that bush white house just at the time that soviet power collapsed. %$* 13
and it’s been said that, basically, it all happened so fast at the time that nobody in the white house saw it coming until pretty much just before it went down. %$* 13
is that an accurate picture of it? %$* 13
yes, more or less. %$* 107
we weren’t able to project the crisis and what would happen day by day, not least because the leaders in moscow weren’t able to project the crisis and what would happen day by day. %$* 107
vaclav havel, the czech leader at the time, said, “things are happening so fast, we do not have time to be astonished.” %$* 107
which sounds like it could describe today, quite possibly. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, robert blackwill. %$* 13
and bob, your partner is? %$* 13
peter hitchens-- %$* 107
well-known columnist, author, spent a lot of time thinking about and living in russia. %$* 107
and i commend to you his columns in the sunday mail. %$* 107
ladies and gentlemen, peter hitchens. %$* 13
peter, i was going to do that commercial for you, but your partner just did it so well. %$* 13
i just want to point out you spent two and a half years living in the soviet union-- %$* 13
at the end of the soviet union. %$* 13
and, rather controversially, you have written that you actually like vladimir putin. %$* 13
and, at the same time, you call him a “sinister tyrant.” so, how does that work? %$* 13
well, i think sometimes countries need sinister tyrants. %$* 108
and russia is a country that needs a sinister tyrant now, having been through the dreadful debauchery and rape of the yeltsin era, which we imposed upon it. %$* 108
it needs a sinister tyrant to-- %$* 108
many, many russians who love their country feel that way, and they've always preferred to be feared than pitied. %$* 108
and i think that's not an unreasonable position, and i quite understand it. %$* 108
i'm lucky enough to live in a country which doesn't need to be feared or pitied, but i would hate to be in a country that was pitied. %$* 108
where are you from? %$* 13
well, actually, i was born in malta, a small island in the middle of the mediterranean, but it's part of the british empire. %$* 108
oh. %$* 13
but the british empire has subsequently disappeared. %$* 108
so i-- %$* 108
what i live in is airstrip one, a small province of the european union. %$* 108
ladies and gentlemen, peter hitchens. %$* 13
formerly known as great britain. %$* 108
so this is a debate. %$* 13
there will be a winner and a loser, and you, our live audience here in new york will choose by voting twice, once before the debate and once again after the debate. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers have moved the most in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. %$* 13
let's go now to the preliminary vote. %$* 13
the motion is this: russia is a marginal power. %$* 13
on to round one. %$* 13
round one, opening statements from each debater in turn. %$* 13
they are seven minutes each. %$* 13
our motion is russia is a marginal power. %$* 13
and here to speak from the lectern first in support of this motion, edward lucas. %$* 13
he is a senior editor at the economist where he has covered the central and east european region for over 25 years, including time spent as the economist moscow bureau chief. %$* 13
he is the author of "the snowden operation.” ladies and gentlemen, edward lucas. %$* 13
thanks very much, mr. %$* 106
chairman. %$* 106
of course, russia matters. %$* 106
it can't not matter. %$* 106
it's the largest country in the world by land mass. %$* 106
it's a $2 trillion economy, and it's a super power, not only a nuclear superpower but a cultural, scientific and linguistic one. %$* 106
the question is how to use that great potential. %$* 106
does it maximize it in the mainstream of world affairs, or does it squander it on the sidelines? %$* 106
and it's my contention that russia squanders its potential under the rule of vladimir putin. %$* 106
now, we had great hopes 25 years ago in those glorious days when peter and i were covering the collapse of the evil empire, that freed from the burden of communism, of the burden of imperial history, that russia would take its rightful place as a great power in the mainstream world affairs. %$* 106
and it didn't happen. %$* 106
now, i disagree with peter. %$* 106
i don't think that we imposed something on russia in the '90s. %$* 106
i think the russian leadership squandered those chances with a mixture of corruption, spectacular corruption, nostalgia and paranoia, and it's got worse and worse as it's gone on. %$* 106
what has russia got now to contribute to the great problems that are facing us? %$* 106
what does russia have in the way of a constructive original solution on the law of the sea, space, climate change, internet freedom, development, world trade system, reforming world finance, ethics of medical research, or on security? %$* 106
what's it have to say about the middle east? %$* 106
about wars in africa, about how east asia should cope with a rising china? %$* 106
i just ask my opponents if they can think of one constructive original contribution that russia has made to these questions. %$* 106
it'd be great if they'd like to declare it because it's very easy to know what russia's against. %$* 106
russia's against the eu.it's against nato.it's against modern organizations in general. %$* 106
it's against the west. %$* 106
so we know what russia's against, but we don't know what russia's for. %$* 106
now, you may say, well, what russia is for is sovereignty. %$* 106
it believes in the principle of nonintervention, and that's why it stands by and blocks sanctions against-- %$* 106
any sanctions against syria that might have some effect on the terrible conflict there. %$* 106
but it's not consistent in this. %$* 106
it doesn't practice what it preaches. %$* 106
it's strongly against intervention when it comes to the west. %$* 106
but it's in favor of intervention, in fact, it loves intervention when it comes to the captive nations of the empire, perhaps the one countries that from all they suffered under soviet rule, it should treat with the greatest sensitivity and respect. %$* 106
now, i believe in principle that intervention is sometimes right. %$* 106
i think we should have intervened in rwanda, for example, to stop the genocide. %$* 106
but i think it was a high buy. %$* 106
you have to produce some evidence if you're going to intervene, evidence of real human rights abuses. %$* 106
there's no other way of an intervention to try and solve them. %$* 106
but russia hasn't done that in ukraine. %$* 106
russia hasn't produced any evidence at all. %$* 106
it asserts things, but it hasn't invoked international human rights organizations, it hasn't tried to negotiate with the ukrainian government. %$* 106
its intervention in ukraine is decried by the very people it aims to help. %$* 106
we have the russian philological society in eastern ukraine appealing to putin to hold back. %$* 106
we have all the jewish organizations and all the chief rabbis writing an open letter to putin saying, please don't do this. %$* 106
so he doesn't produce evidence. %$* 106
he doesn't produce arguments. %$* 106
he doesn't like engaging with the mainstream of the way the world works because he knows those arguments are phony, and the evidence is empty, and his chances are slim. %$* 106
i'd just like to-- %$* 106
as my opponents over there have been rather silent, to give them another question. %$* 106
can you name one european country, one democracy that thinks what russia is doing is right. %$* 106
in fact, okay, further, can you name one real friend that russia has, a country that is friends with russia because it wants to be, not because it has to be. %$* 106
so don't count tajikistan, which has russian troops on its territory. %$* 106
don't count armenia, which was arm-twisted into abandoning its deal with the european union. %$* 106
don't count belarus which was strangled with the gas pipeline. %$* 106
name a normal country, a country-- %$* 106
name a country, a country which actually says, yes, russia, we share your views. %$* 106
we like you. %$* 106
please don't mention bashir assad in syria or venezuela. %$* 106
name a respectable country that is actually-- %$* 106
that actually likes russia and says, "good job, vladimir, we really like it.” russia is a marginal power, and it's marginalized itself. %$* 106
it's not the west. %$* 106
we showered yeltsin's russia with money. %$* 106
misfit, stolen and wasted, but we tried. %$* 106
we brought russia into the g8.we set up the nato russia council. %$* 106
we brought russia into the european security architect, the council of europe, the osc, all these organizations. %$* 106
and it hasn't worked because russia doesn't want to be in the mainstream. %$* 106
russia doesn't like having responsibilities. %$* 106
it doesn't like having rules. %$* 106
it doesn't like respecting other countries' rights. %$* 106
it likes doing things its own way, and that's a terrible misfortune for russia's neighbors, and it's a terrible misfortune for the-- %$* 106
for the people of russia. %$* 106
now, i don't want to intrude too much on private grief, but i'd just like to ask you to share-- %$* 106
spare a thought for a moment for our opponents here, because they would love to believe that putin had done something right, that maybe he'd sort of modernized russia, he'd sort of stabilized russia. %$* 106
he'd maybe repaired russia's infrastructure, that he'd made russia a power that could be respected, and it hasn't happened. %$* 106
the putin years have been 14 years of terrible missed opportunity. %$* 106
more than a trillion dollars of excess oil and gas revenues came flooding into the coffers of the russian federation. %$* 106
at the end of it, you still can't drive from one end of russia to the other. %$* 106
but who's to blame for that? %$* 106
not the west, not the outside world. %$* 106
you have to blame the crooks, the thugs, the spooks and the cronies who have been misruling russia, losing of tens of billions dollars a year, sometimes i admit with our complicity, laundered in the city of london, in austria, maybe even new york, who knows? %$* 106
it's been a catastrophe. %$* 106
we should not approach this debate in some kind of tale of sneering triumphalism. %$* 106
it's not that we're pleased that russia's on the sidelines. %$* 106
it's a tragedy. %$* 106
we need russia to be playing a role in the mainstream of world policies, in the mainstream of world affairs, and it's not happening. %$* 106
one day maybe it will. %$* 106
but for the time being, ladies and gentlemen, russia is a marginal power. %$* 106
thank you, edward lucas. %$* 13
and that is our motion: russia is a marginal power. %$* 13
and now here to argue against this motion, i'd like to bring to the lectern peter hitchens. %$* 13
he is a columnist and reporter for the man on sunday and a former resident correspondent for the daily express in moscow and in washington, d.c. ladies and gentlemen, peter hitchens. %$* 13
well, good evening, or dobryy vecher as they say in the kremlin. %$* 108
i feel a bit underdressed for this occasion. %$* 108
i haven't brought my order of the red banner, but i'm sure edward will have ordered me one by the end of the evening. %$* 108
all right. %$* 108
edward and i hugely enjoyed the cold war. %$* 108
i enjoyed particularly as an ex- trotskyist, i loathed the soviet regime from that point of view, and then later on as a fervent cold warrior and a genuine believer in the truth that the soviet union was an evil empire. %$* 108
it was an evil empire. %$* 108
there's no question about it. %$* 108
and anybody who doubts it should have seen what i saw. %$* 108
but the problem of enjoying the cold war and if we’d like to get a party together to go and put the berlin wall up again tonight, i'll be at the head of it because it was, in many ways, extremely enjoyable for journalists and a wonderful moment in which we all knew which side we were on. %$* 108
enjoying the cold war as much as we did as a pleasure is that we forget that we ought to look upon it in one or two other rather important ways. %$* 108
there was a very, very important moment in the early years of mikhail gorbachev when he was dismantling the soviet union, when he came under attack from a group of american conservative journalists who kept on saying, "we don't believe this. %$* 108
we don't believe that you're doing to the soviet union what we say that you are.” and he just sat there smiling silkily as he did. %$* 108
and eventually he said, "gentlemen, i'm terribly sorry. %$* 108
we have done to you the worst thing, the most unkind thing we could possibly have done to anybody. %$* 108
we have deprived you of an enemy." and this was what happened in 1991. %$* 108
we were deprived of an enemy. %$* 108
i was in moscow on that lovely sunny monday morning in august 1991.i came out of my block of flats, my neighbors were the brezhnev family and the andropov family. %$* 108
i came out of my block of flats, onto my street, prospect, and down the street were coming tanks, in the slanting sunshine, with their barrels pointing towards the center of moscow, rolling down, kicking up dust, a very strangely moving sight. %$* 108
and i saw moscow through all the following days as collapsed utterly. %$* 108
and one particular scene is burned upon my memory, and that is this, that in every trashcan in the city, every single trashcan was full to the brim of communist party membership cards burning. %$* 108
it was over. %$* 108
there was no question in my mind that it was over. %$* 108
this was not the soviet union, it was russia. %$* 108
a year later, i was allowed to go into the closed city, as it then was, of sevastopol, to see what was left of the soviet navy, admiral gorshkov's great global blue water navy, the principal instrument of power projection of the soviet union, in its struggle for mastery of the planet with the united states. %$* 108
and in every creek and inlet around sevastopol were sunken ships, ships downed by the bow, ships downed by the stern, ships canting over at degree-- %$* 108
at 45 degrees, abandoned, wrecked, finished, over, dead, gone. %$* 108
so we have the communist party gone, and we have the world power gone. %$* 108
and then we have this extraordinary era in which i'm afraid edward has been a little bit, how shall i say, "kind," to the west, in which we said to the russians that, "we must now have in russia democracy, and we must now have capitalism.” and we indeed showered them with money and stupid advice, paying very little attention to what that country really needed, which was the rule of law and liberty. %$* 108
and that whole era is now known to most russians who lived through it when it was a time of debauched currency, hopeless, terrible corruption, misery and theft, the loss of their homes, the loss of their jobs, the wiping out of their savings overnight. %$* 108
they refer to it-- %$* 108
you'll know the russians, their democracy is-- %$* 108
demokratiya they refer to it as "dermokratiya," which i will translate politely as the "rule of excrement." that is the view of most russians of what they went through. %$* 108
i will end with another reminiscence because this is very important in understanding why it is that russia now so very much desires to be left alone. %$* 108
the other reminiscence is in my first week in moscow, i went to a film being shown in the cosmos cinema. %$* 108
and it was a film called, which means approximately, "we can't go on living like this.” it was made by a man called stanislav govorukhin, who was a great friend of alexander solzhenitsyn. %$* 108
and it went through in great detail-- %$* 108
and it's a disgrace that no western cinema and no western tv stations ever shown this film because it's so graphic-- %$* 108
it went through in great detail the horrible misery, corruption, oppression, and lies of the soviet union. %$* 108
and i became aware as i sat watching this that everybody in the cinema was weeping. %$* 108
for the first time, they had been allowed to see in detail the truth about the disastrous country in which they'd been living. %$* 108
now what they want is actually to be left alone, to be russia, a country which will exist whatever you do to it. %$* 108
you might as well try and remove the himalayas with a teaspoon as to remove russia from the international, diplomatic, or military, or economic landscape. %$* 108
it simply is not going to go away. %$* 108
and to pretend that it will and to impose on it carthaginian treaties, when its territory is taken away and it's pushed up to the same borders, imposed on it by keiser wilhelm in 1918 is not going to work. %$* 108
but the thing to remember about that film is that during the last election in which vladimir putin won, one of his key supporters was stanislav govorukhin, friend of solzhenitsyn. %$* 108
and he said, "i'm supporting putin because under yeltsin we had disgusting hopeless misery and debauchery. %$* 108
under vladimir putin we have normal corruption." and that was not a feeling which was unshared by millions and millions of russians. %$* 108
he spoke for them. %$* 108
when putin was elected, it wasn't entirely undemocratic. %$* 108
i a very simple point here. %$* 108
here we are in a country which has the pacific ocean on one side, the atlantic ocean on the other, mexico at the bottom, and canada at the top. %$* 108
now, just imagine for a moment that you didn't have that, you had germany on side and china on the other and japan breathing down your neck, and that you didn't have a gigantic global navy or an enormous amount of physical wealth, but you actually had to cope with the fact that you had dangerous neighbors, you might be less concerned with fanciful global ideas of wonderful global international cooperation, and you might be more concerned with the simple straightforward issue of whether you could survive defensibly as a country, a society, an economy, and a culture. %$* 108
you would be closer to the truth than you are here in this extraordinary, wonderfully protected paradise. %$* 108
ladies and gentlemen, russia is not a marginal power. %$* 108
please do vote against this motion. %$* 108
it is a very foolish motion indeed. %$* 108
thank you, thank you, peter hitchens. %$* 13
and here's a reminder of where we are. %$* 13
we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two against two, arguing it out over this motion, "russia is a marginal power.” you've heard the first two opening statements, and now on to a third. %$* 13
debating in support of this motion, that "russia is a marginal power," ian bremmer will now go to the lectern. %$* 13
he is founder and president of the global political risk research and consulting firm, the eurasia group, an author of "every nation for itself, winners and losers in a g-zero world.” ladies and gentlemen, ian bremmer. %$* 13
so let me start by saying i'm sympathetic to much of what peter said. %$* 105
i certainly agree that the united states was not trying to rebuild russia after the cold war was over the way we did japan and europe with macarthur and the marshall plan. %$* 105
shock therapy, nato enlargement, energy diversification, those things that we actually did didn't help russia, they weakened russia. %$* 105
okay, let's remember what this debate is about. %$* 105
the debate is about-- %$* 105
not about "are we sympathetic with russia's position? %$* 105
" i'm very sympathetic with russia's position. %$* 105
they're just losing, right? %$* 105
they're-- %$* 105
if we had helped them a lot, they might still be a great power. %$* 105
maybe, it's possible, they lost a lot. %$* 105
they had little legitimacy, but they might have-- %$* 105
they'd be in better shape. %$* 105
peter and i clearly agree on this. %$* 105
the problem is he's debating the other side, right? %$* 105
what we're debating is that russia's not a great power, it's a marginal power. %$* 105
i decided to look something up in the dictionary before i got here. %$* 105
marginal, what's the definition of marginal? %$* 105
it was "not of central importance, limited in extent, significance or stature.” i look at global politics today. %$* 105
i look at the economy. %$* 105
russia isnot a great power. %$* 105
it is a marginal power, and it's becoming more marginal by the day. %$* 105
i had a discussion with david miliband, the ex- british foreign secretary just a few weeks ago, and there was a question from the audience as to why it was that british relations with russia had gotten to be so poor. %$* 105
and he said, "well, you see, the brits believe that russia is in decline, and russia believes that britain is in decline," and we are both correct. %$* 105
that's where we are. %$* 105
oh, look, i agree with peter as well that putin is a sinister tyrant. %$* 105
do i think that russia really wants that? %$* 105
no, no, i don't. %$* 105
certainly they like a little less sinister. %$* 105
they understand that leadership needs to be strong, but less sinister. %$* 105
anticorruption? %$* 105
the russians themselves did a poll on this in the last couple months, 5 percent of russians believe that the anticorruption policies of putin were in any way effective. %$* 105
they'd like them to be a little bit more effective. %$* 105
they would. %$* 105
you know, 110 russians presently control 35 percent of russia's household wealth. %$* 105
we have-- %$* 105
we talk about inequality in the united states. %$* 105
the russians actually get it right, right? %$* 105
0.0000007 percent of russians control 35 percent of the country's household wealth. %$* 105
look, it is a big country. %$* 105
they don't have many people on it , it's a big country, right? %$* 105
i mean, palin can see them from her house-- %$* 105
you know, putin can see alaska from his house. %$* 105
alaska doesn't have much sway in the bottom 48, right? %$* 105
it's big. %$* 105
they've got a lot of resources. %$* 105
they don't have many people, right? %$* 105
we're not excited about alaska. %$* 105
i apologize if you're from alaska, but we don't care. %$* 105
the problem is what’s russia doing with all of that land? %$* 105
what’s-- %$* 105
what are you doing with all of that potential? %$* 105
i’ll tell you what they’re not doing is fixing their economy. %$* 105
there have been a lot of companies out there that have thought about investing big in russia. %$* 105
ikea used to make more money per square meter in russia than anywhere else in the world in the early 90s. %$* 105
they’ve pulled back. %$* 105
why? %$* 105
because folks came in. %$* 105
they said, “oh, you’ve got environmental problems. %$* 105
under your parking lot, there’s a gas line. %$* 105
you’re going to have to pay us an awful lot. %$* 105
we won’t do that. %$* 105
oh, i guess we’ll shut down ikea for a bit.” wal-mart thought about it for four years, decided not to invest. %$* 105
wal-mart wants to be everywhere. %$* 105
they’re your big-box, low-cost leader. %$* 105
they’re all over china. %$* 105
that’s not an easy place to invest. %$* 105
they’re not in russia. %$* 105
toyota, $28 million in st. %$* 105
petersburg because the russians desperately wanted them-- %$* 105
the japanese to work with them. %$* 105
koizumi brought over the chairman and ceo. said, “let’s do this.” they said, “we’ll test it out, and if it goes well a few years later, we’ll make russia the base of manufacturing for the entire eurasia region.” have they expanded? %$* 105
absolutely not. %$* 105
everything walked out the door, right? %$* 105
economics-- %$* 105
we have to say economics matter, right? %$* 105
we can’t just pretend that it-- %$* 105
that it’s not important. %$* 105
geopolitics-- %$* 105
here, let me go back to my friend edward here. %$* 105
you’re right. %$* 105
tajikistan, armenia, belarus-- %$* 105
that is not a portfolio you want. %$* 105
snowden-- %$* 105
the chinese handled snowden well. %$* 105
they said, “let’s get him. %$* 105
let’s bring him over. %$* 105
we’ll grab all of his stuff. %$* 105
we’ll learn some stuff about how the american’s are spying on us. %$* 105
and then, we’ll send him somewhere.” and russia said, “me, me, me. %$* 105
let’s have him.” and the russians grab him. %$* 105
they said, “we’ll take all the stuff. %$* 105
and then, we’ll send him to cuba. %$* 105
oh, we didn’t think that through very well.” they don’t want to keep him. %$* 105
it became a problem. %$* 105
they didn’t think it through very well. %$* 105
again, feather in putin’s cap. %$* 105
it’s great. %$* 105
he can swan around. %$* 105
feather in putin’s cap. %$* 105
$51 billion on sochi. %$* 105
what did that do for the average russian? %$* 105
how’s that done for russia in the world? %$* 105
it’s been a problem. %$* 105
ukraine is the most important national security interest that russia has outside of their country. %$* 105
the average russian believes that ukraine has been a part of it for 300 years. %$* 105
the americans and the europeans didn’t care. %$* 105
yanukovych wanted aid from the americans and europeans so that he could balance the russians off against the europeans. %$* 105
and we said, “sorry, not it. %$* 105
we’ve got other things to take care of.”and so, then, putin said, “i’ll write you a check for 15 billion out of our pension fund.” and, you know what? %$* 105
the ukrainian people said, “we don’t care. %$* 105
we don’t want the money. %$* 105
we’ll demonstrate. %$* 105
we’ll die in the streets, rather than have to live under that.” that’s ukraine. %$* 105
we’re not talking about germany. %$* 105
we’re not talking about indonesia. %$* 105
these are the people that speak russian and ukrainian together. %$* 105
so, they’ll have crimea. %$* 105
they will take crimea. %$* 105
we told them, “red line.” we told lots of-- %$* 105
we told the syrians, “red line.” they stepped over it. %$* 105
does that mean that they are a great power? %$* 105
syria? %$* 105
it does not. %$* 105
are the russians a great power? %$* 105
they are not. %$* 105
let me just end a couple other economic bits. %$* 105
how big are the russians today, economically, compared to china? %$* 105
chinese economy is more than four times larger. %$* 105
that’s pretty-- %$* 105
talk about the brics, as if they’re all places that you would think about with equal importance. %$* 105
the russians are losing out in their backyard because of the chinese imposing their will increasingly economically dominating central asia, because that’s where all the investments are going to come from. %$* 105
east siberia, because the chinese are demographically swamping russia there. %$* 105
the russians are concerned about that. %$* 105
there’s no question in my mind that if we look at the future for russia geo-politically, geo-economically, demographically, this is not a great power. %$* 105
we all wish it were. %$* 105
it’d be better for them. %$* 105
it’d be better for the world. %$* 105
but, it’s not. %$* 105
and i think you should vote, as a consequence, with us, and for the motion. %$* 105
thank you. %$* 105
thank you ian bremmer. %$* 13
and the motion is “russia is a marginal power.” and now, our final debater against the motion in opening statements, robert blackwill. %$* 13
he is the henry a.kissinger senior fellow for u.s.foreign policy at the council on foreign relations, and former deputy national security adviser under president george w.bush. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, robert blackwill. %$* 13
good evening. %$* 107
skillful debaters, when they have a weak case to make, change the subject. %$* 107
so, let’s remember what the subject is. %$* 107
it is not, “is russia a responsible member of the international community? %$* 107
” no, it’s not. %$* 107
it isn’t, “does russia have friends? %$* 107
” no, it’s not. %$* 107
it isn’t, “would you vote vladimir putin to be your church deacon? %$* 107
” the answer is no. %$* 107
and finally, it is not, “is russia a great power? %$* 107
” that is not the subject of this debate. %$* 107
the subject of this debate is, “is russia a marginal power? %$* 107
” and, as our colleague mentioned, this means a country with very little impact on the international system, and very little consequence for the united states. %$* 107
so, i’m going to quickly go through why i believe that’s deeply mistake. %$* 107
so, first, russia, today, is the only country on mother earth that can destroy the united states as we know it in 30 minutes. %$* 107
it has 1,500 nuclear weapons on hair trigger aimed at america’s cities. %$* 107
no other country could have the effect on the united states of russia. %$* 107
it has 10,000 nuclear weapons. %$* 107
think hiroshima. %$* 107
think nagasaki-- %$* 107
100,000 people died. %$* 107
and think 10,000 nuclear weapons. %$* 107
second, the united states and russia possess 95 percent of all nuclear weapons on the planet. %$* 107
and let me just quote one of my favorite senators, if not my favorite senator, diane feinstein: “we have a chance to wind down and expedite the removal of 96 percent of the world’s nuclear weapons.”what an achievement it would be we could say that the nuclear arsenals of both russia and the united states have been reduced to the barest minimums. %$* 107
that cannot be done without moscow. %$* 107
and it’s hardly the example of a marginal county. %$* 107
third, nuclear terrorist-- %$* 107
something that, of course, this great city is preoccupied with, because it would be one of the principle targets if a nuclear weapon got into the hands of terrorists. %$* 107
since the end of the cold war that we’ve been discussing, the two countries that possess most of the weapons, including russia, have lost not one single loose nuke. %$* 107
and that has a major impact, potentially, on your lives. %$* 107
fourth, russia works with the united states to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, especially nuclear weapons and missile-delivery systems. %$* 107
is their record perfect? %$* 107
no, it’s not. %$* 107
but they are deeply involved in the negotiations we are having-- %$* 107
we, americans, are having with iran on the future of the iranian nuclear weapons program, and on our efforts to cap the north korean nuclear program. %$* 107
sixth, russia today is a vital lifeline for the 40,000 american troops that remain in afghanistan. %$* 107
we could not supply our courageous men and women in afghanistan fighting that war without the so-called “northern route” through russia. %$* 107
and this is largely because of our problems with pakistan, but it’s absolutely indispensable to the safety and security of american troops in afghanistan. %$* 107
the u.n. security council-- %$* 107
russia is a permanent member. %$* 107
and, if you care about international law, and if you care about the united states acting abroad in the context of international law-- %$* 107
that is to say through security council resolutions-- %$* 107
that cannot happen unless russia supports that. %$* 107
and we can all remember of actions the u.s.has taken the last 15 years which couldn’t command the unanimous vote of the u.n.permanent members, and which, you’ll remember, didn’t go all that well. %$* 107
of course, as it’s been mentioned, russia’s the largest country in the world. %$* 107
an eighth of the earth’s surface in this extraordinary country. %$* 107

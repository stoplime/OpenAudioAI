invaded parts of Georgia and created a frozen conflict there.", "sentId": 9}], "secId": 4}, {"speaker": "OBAMA", "sentences": [{"text": "There was a new president and we tried to initiate a more constructive path with respect to U.S.-Russia relations.", "sentId": 10}, {"text": "And I think we showed Russia plenty of respect, acknowledging enormous differences and different values, but also trying to find ways in which we could cooperate together.", "sentId": 11}], "secId": 5}, {"speaker": "OBAMA", "sentences": [{"text": "We initiated a new START treaty, we assisted Russia with respect to its ascension to the WTO.", "sentId": 12}, {"text": "We worked on some common international challenges together, and when the previous president was replaced with Mr. Putin, I met with him and we discussed again, ways in which we could constructively work together.", "sentId": 13}], "secId": 6}, {"speaker": "OBAMA", "sentences": [{"text": "The challenge that we had with Russia is very much centered in Russian aggression in some very particular areas around the world, in Ukraine, where they have engaged in similar conduct to what they did in Georgia.", "sentId": 14}], "secId": 7}, {"speaker": "OBAMA", "sentences": [{"text": "And even there, we've tried to broker and work with the Europeans to broker a Minsk Agreement that would peacefully resolve those issues.", "sentId": 15}, {"text": "In Syria, one of my earliest meetings with Putin was to suggest to him, that if Assad stayed in power, given brutality with which he treated his own people, he would see a civil war that would not be good for the Syrians, certainly, but would not be good for the world anywhere.", "sentId": 16}], "secId": 8}, {"speaker": "OBAMA", "sentences": [{"text": "Rather than to work with us to try to solve the problem, he doubled down on his support for Assad, and we know of the situation that exists there.", "sentId": 17}, {"text": "So, any characterization that somehow we have improperly challenged Russia aggression or have somehow tried to encroach on their legitimate interests is just wrong.", "sentId": 18}], "secId": 9}, {"speaker": "OBAMA", "sentences": [{"text": "And Mr. Trump's continued flattery of Mr. Putin and the degree to which he appears to model many of his policies and approaches to politics on Mr. Putin, is unprecedented in American politics, and is out of step with, not just what Democrats think but out of step with what, up until the last few months, almost every Republican thought, including some of the ones who are now endorsing Mr. Trump.", "sentId": 19}], "secId": 10}, {"speaker": "OBAMA", "sentences": [{"text": "So you don't have to explain to me how it is that some of the same leaders of the Republican Party, who were constantly haranguing us for even talking to the Russians, and who consistently took the most hawkish approaches to Russia, including Mr. Trump's selection for vice president, now reconciles their endorsement of Mr. Trump with their previous views.", "sentId": 20}], "secId": 11}, {"speaker": "OBAMA", "sentences": [{"text": "The bottom line is, is that we think that Russia is a large important country with a military that is second only to ours, and has to be a part of the solution on the world stage, rather than part of the problem.", "sentId": 21}], "secId": 12}, {"speaker": "OBAMA", "sentences": [{"text": "But their behavior has undermined international norms and international rules in ways that we have to call them out on.", "sentId": 22}, {"text": "And anybody who occupies this office should feel the same way because these are values that we fought for and we protected.", "sentId": 23}], "secId": 13}, {"speaker": "OBAMA", "sentences": [{"text": "We can't go around talking about human rights or freedom of the press or democracy or freedom of religion or nondiscrimination or basic laws of war or the sovereignty and territorial integrity of countries, no matter how small, and then extol the virtues of

diplomatically now supporting and, in some cases, echoing his positions.", "sentId": 26}, {"text": "It's quite a reversal.", "sentId": 27}, {"text": "You'll have to ask them how to explain it.",

{"speaker": "OBAMA", "sentences": [{"text": "But based on what we have seen, heard, learned, some of the more sensational implications or appearances, as you stated them, aren't based on actual events and based on what actually happened and I think derived from sort of overly broad characterizations of interactions between the State Department and the FBI that happen a lot and happen between agencies.", "sentId": 31}, {"text": "I think that covers me.", "sentId": 32}], "secId": 17}, {"speaker": "RENZI", "sentences": [{"text": "What are forms , I know 2016 is not a very good year to organize a referendum.", "sentId": 33}, {"text": "But I think the entire referendum is very simply in the message because it's about the fight against bureaucracy.", "sentId": 34}, {"text": "And we need a great investment against bureaucracy in Italy for a lot of reasons.", "sentId": 35}], "secId": 18}, {"speaker": "RENZI", "sentences": [{"text": "We change the '63 government in seven years, few times we joke about it with the president because it's unbelievable, in a country that have a government change one year every year.", "sentId": 36}, {"text": "But it's normal and the discussion, the political discussion is very strong.", "sentId": 37}], "secId": 19}, {"speaker": "RENZI", "sentences": [{"text": "My opinion is very easy.", "sentId": 38}, {"text": "If, in December, we'll win -- we will this referendum for Italy, it will be easy, more easy to continue the battle to change Europe because structural reforms are important for Italy but they are important also for institutions in Brussels, in Europe.", "sentId": 39}], "secId": 20}, {"speaker": "RENZI", "sentences": [{"text": "So the only consequence, constitutional reform a part in the political debate, in my view is, if we win, Italy will be stronger and the debate in E.U.", "sentId": 40}, {"text": "And so I work strongly and utterly  to achieve the victory.", "sentId": 41}], "secId": 21}, {"speaker": "QUESTION",

there is a negative result in terms of the reforms, to just leave.", "sentId": 53}], "secId": 31}, {"speaker": "QUESTION ", "sentences": [{"text": "So what can you tell these investors in order to

bring some wine to the dinner with the president?", "sentId": 56}, {"text": "This is an Italian custom.", "sentId": 57}], "secId": 32}, {"speaker": "QUESTION", "sentences": [{"text": "Mr. President.",

efforts therefore jeopardizing these efforts.", "sentId": 62}, {"text": "What can you say to Brussels, especially after Brexit?", "sentId": 63}], "secId": 35}, {"speaker": "QUESTION", "sentences": [{"text": "You know, they don't seem to be moving on that front, you know, how important -- how important it is to move forward in that direction and do you think that in case the referendum will not go well for the prime minister, he should stay on and continue in his reform?", "sentId": 64}, {"text": "Thank you.", "sentId": 65}], "secId": 36}, {"speaker": "RENZI ", "sentences": [{"text": "I have a feeling and I think that rightly so our American friends are a little bit more interested in November 8 than in the Italian vote on constitutional reform and so are we, might I add.", "sentId":

system in Italy giving greater stability and certain times in which to have greater stability?", "sentId": 76}], "secId": 40}, {"speaker": "RENZI ", "sentences": [{"text": "This is something to simplify things in our country and based on the question that was asked to the president on Europe, we do respect the European rules and we're totally inside the European rules although sometimes we do this half-heartedly.", "sentId": 77}], "secId": 41}, {"speaker": "RENZI ", "sentences": [{"text": "We'd like to do things differently but so long as rules don't change we will respect them because

certain that the \"yes\" will win so you will have no grounds to ask this question.", "sentId": 80}], "secId": 43}, {"speaker": "OBAMA", "sentences": [{"text": "During the course of my presidency, I have had repeated conversations with Brussels, with Angola, with Francois  others around how we could most effectively recover from the crisis of 2007, 2008.", "sentId": 81}], "secId": 44}, {"speaker": "OBAMA", "sentences": [{"text": "It is fair to say that we have made more progress more quickly and what I've tried to point out was the reason we were able to make progress was we focused very early on in providing a large infusion of demand through our fiscal policies rebuilding roads, bridges, investing in schools, teachers, clean energy, putting people back to work, tax cuts put money in the pockets of consumers, saving the auto industry.", "sentId": 82}], "secId": 45}, {"speaker": "OBAMA", "sentences": [{"text": "But then also, what was very important was quickly trying to fix the banks and infusing capital and making sure they were more stable, more transparent, and would attract confidence that the financial system was working again.", "sentId": 83}], "secId": 46}, {"speaker": "OBAMA", "sentences": [{"text": "And look, I'm proud of our economic track record.", "sentId": 84}, {"text": "We have grown faster and created more jobs, and this past year, seen incomes rise and poverty fall more quickly than a lot of our counterparts in Europe.", "sentId": 85}], "secId": 47}, {"speaker": "OBAMA", "sentences": [{"text": "Now, I recognize that Europe is a more complicated collection of states, and it's more difficult to move.", "sentId": 86}, {"text": "And some are in the Eurozone and some are not.", "sentId": 87}, {"text": "And so I don't expect that everything we've done can immediately translate to Europe.", "sentId": 88}, {"text": "And there's some parts of what Europe does that we could learn from, in terms of the social safety net, for example.", "sentId": 89}], "secId": 48}, {"speaker": "OBAMA", "sentences": [{"text": "But what I do know is that given the very slow growth that's taken place in Europe or a contraction over what is almost a decade now, you have a generation of European youth who are not attaching themselves to the labor market fast enough, and if you don't reverse some of those trends, then it becomes a generational loss of income, of wealth, of economic dynamism.", "sentId": 90}], "secId": 49}, {"speaker": "OBAMA", "sentences": [{"text": "And now that countries like Italy and others have made real progress, their finances and their deficits, and there's more market confidence in their position, now would be a good time, I believe, to refocus attention on growth and making investments.", "sentId": 91}, {"text": "Because one of the reasons that we've been able to cut our deficits by two-thirds is not simply because we cut spending by two thirds.", "sentId": 92}, {"text": "We disciplined spending, but we also grew fast enough that more revenue came in and that's one of the best ways for you to arrive at a sound fiscal position.", "sentId": 93}], "secId": 50}, {"speaker": "OBAMA", "sentences": [{"text": "And monetary policy alone is not sufficient.", "sentId": 94}, {"text": "I think Mario Draghi and the European Central Bank have done good work trying to maintain a positive trajectory in Europe, but ultimately, there's only so much monetary policy can do if it's not combined with fiscal policy.", "sentId": 95}, {"text": "And my hope would be that Matteo is right.", "sentId": 96}], "secId": 51}, {"speaker": "OBAMA", "sentences": [{"text": "Italy has been true to its word in Europe, and met its obligations, but my hope would be the debate broadens as Europe moves forward around how to grow more quickly, put more people back to work, see incomes rise, create a greater sense of momentum and optimism, because I do believe that there is a connection between stagnation and some of the less constructive populist impulses that have been rising up.", "sentId": 97}], "secId": 52}, {"speaker": "OBAMA", "sentences": [{"text": "Those trend lines about Europe do concern me, because if you look at the European experiment over the last 40 years, I said this in Hanover, there's probably been no group of people who've enjoyed more prosperity and more peace over the last several decades than a united Europe.", "sentId": 98}, {"text": "If it begins now splintering because their sense is the -- global capital and elites are not attentive to the ordinary concerns of people, that would be a tragedy, and my hope is that that discussion, led by Matteo and others, will continue.", "sentId": 99}], "secId": 53}, {"speaker": "OBAMA", "sentences": [{"text": "And by the way, yes.", "sentId": 100}, {"text": "I think if -- I won't weigh in on the referendum, but the reforms Matteo's initiating, certainly on the economic side, are the right ones, and in a global, internet-driven world, governments have to be able to move fast and quickly and transparently,  And so I am rooting for success but I think he should -- he should hang around for a while no matter what.", "sentId": 101}], "secId": 54}, {"speaker": "OBAMA", "sentences": [{"text": "Aisha Roscoe .", "sentId": 102}], "secId": 55}, {"speaker": "QUESTION", "sentences": [{"text":

you worried the results of the election may be distrusted?", "sentId": 108}], "secId": 59}, {"speaker": "QUESTION", "sentences": [{"text": "And for Prime Minister Renzi, the offensive in Mosul has begun.", "sentId": 109}], "secId": 60}, {"speaker": "QUESTION", "sentences": [{"text": "Are you concerned about what happens after liberation?", "sentId": 110}], "secId": 61}, {"speaker": "QUESTION",

person who loses the election congratulates the winner, who reaffirms our democracy and we move forward.", "sentId": 115}], "secId": 66}, {"speaker": "OBAMA", "sentences": [{"text": "That's how democracy survives because we recognize that there's something more important than any individual campaign.", "sentId": 116}, {"text": "And that is making sure that the integrity and trust in our institutions sustains itself.", "sentId": 117}], "secId": 67}, {"speaker": "OBAMA", "sentences": [{"text": "Because democracy, by definition, works by consent, not by force.", "sentId": 118}, {"text":

regardless of ideology, conservative or liberal, who has ever examined these issues in a serious way, will tell you that instances of significant voter fraud are not to be found, that -- keep in mind, elections are run by state and local officials, which means that there are places like Florida, for example, where you've got a Republican governor, whose Republican appointees are going to running and monitoring a whole bunch of these election sites.", "sentId": 121}], "secId": 69}, {"speaker": "OBAMA", "sentences": [{"text": "The notion that somehow if Mr. Trump loses Florida, it's because of

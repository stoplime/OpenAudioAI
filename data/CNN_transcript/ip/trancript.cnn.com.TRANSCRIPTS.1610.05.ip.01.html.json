working around the clock to make sure that we are preventing any potential loss of life and trying to minimize as much as possible the impacts of this storm.", "sentId": 148}, {"text": "But this is

you to prepare in the event that you have to evacuate.", "sentId": 155}, {"text": "Even if you don't have to evacuate, there is no an evacuation order, it still makes sense for you to figure out what kind of plan do you have?", "sentId": 156}, {"text": "What kind of preparations and supplies do you have?", "sentId": 157}, {"text": "And if you need help trying to figure that out, go to ready.gov,

us.", "sentId": 158}], "secId": 63}, {"speaker": "OBAMA", "sentences": [{"text": "So this is something to take seriously.", "sentId": 159}, {"text": "We hope for the best, but we want to prepare for

they should.", "sentId": 126}, {"text": "He's a very good man.", "sentId": 127}, {"text": "But he's one of a number of them.", "sentId": 128}, {"text": "He's one of just a large number of people who

Gonzales on the court saying that, first of all, he's needed as attorney general, but also that perhaps he would have to recuse himself from issues surrounding the war on terror and that would not be appropriate to have a justice on the Supreme Court who would have to do that.", "sentId": 130}], "secId": 51}, {"speaker": "BASH", "sentences": [{"text": "Do you buy into that?", "sentId": 131}],

somebody that has served in the federal government, that may be true of them, as well.", "sentId": 137}], "secId": 55}, {"speaker": "HATCH", "sentences": [{"text": "So if you picked another judge, you

the fact that perhaps this could be a blessing for President Bush in terms of kind of moving off the subject of his domestic agenda on Capitol Hill -- for example, Social Security, the fact that we are talking about the Supreme Court, not talking about Social Security which was not doing very well at all on Capitol Hill -- in terms of just pure politics, if you will, is this sort of a good thing

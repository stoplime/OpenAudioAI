	<P class="cnnBodyText">Aired July 25, 2016 - 12:00 &nbsp; ET</P>
	<P class="cnnBodyText">THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</P>
	<P class="cnnBodyText"><br>[12:00:08] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)<br> <br>JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: All right, joining us now Sean Spicer, the communications director and chief strategist for the Republican National Committee on enemy territory here at the Democratic National Convention. <br> <br>KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR: Yes, did you even (INAUDIBLE) walk through here?<br> <br>SEAN SPICER, RNC COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: No, not yet (INAUDIBLE).<br> <br>BOLDUAN: (INAUDIBLE).<br> <br>BERMAN: (INAUDIBLE).<br> <br>SPICER: Look, they're focused - they're focused on infighting, not coming after us. <br> <br>BOLDUAN: You knew he would go there right away. <br> <br>BERMAN: Yes, Sean, can I ask you a question. <br> <br>SPICER: Yes.<br> <br>BERMAN: The Russians, they hacked into the DNC e-mails. <br> <br>SPICER: Yes.<br> <br>BERMAN: Any evidence that they hacked into the Republican National Committee e-mails? <br> <br>SPICER: No. We have - we have - our security is been maintained. There's been no breach.<br> <br>But just to be clear, one of the things that's interesting about that discussion is, there's no question about who wrote the e-mails. I think the deflection from - from the Clinton - Clinton campaign to talk about the Russians, I get it, that's important to discuss. But the fact of the matter is, is that they - they got caught. They got caught rigging the system. The e-mails are out. And now their defense is, well, it was the Russians. No, it was them who wrote it. If they hadn't written the e-mails rigging the system, there'd be nothing to hack.<br> <br>BOLDUAN: But the real question here, if Russians have hacked into these e-mail systems and - do you think the Russians or Russian state actors are trying to influence U.S. elections? <br> <br>SPICER: I - I have no idea. I don't know any of this. What I do know is that there's no denying the e-mails that they wrote. I do think it's important that we figure out how this happened. But I also think it's interesting that we have - the political e-mails are one thing, right? That's - that's bad for the DNC. It cost Debbie Wasserman Schultz her job. But my concern is that we have a server in Hillary - that Hillary Clinton had, the secret server, that has been noted by the FBI to have had top secret classified information that was venerable. That's what I care about because that's real information that threatens our national security. <br> <br>BERMAN: Let's stay on the DNC for a second right now. You mentioned the political e-mails that are embarrassing. If someone - if someone hacked in - if someone hacked into the Republican National Committee e-mails, would there be anything embarrassing in there? Do you know for a certainly that there would be some e-mails that were upsetting to the Trump campaign? <br> <br>SPICER: Oh, I'm sure there's something. I mean, you know, I'm -<br> <br>BOLDUAN: Then why you making so much? <br> <br>SPICER: No, but there's a difference. No, I don't - no, is there anything that - Reince Priebus and the RNC played it neutral, this thing. Is there something that can be taken out of context? I'm sure. Every day I send funny e-mails. I'm a funny guy. But there's nothing that -<br> <br>BERMAN: There'd be no e-mails that the Trump campaign -<br> <br>SPICER: There's - no, no. Look, no, no, there's nothing that I think Donald Trump would be demanding the resignation of Reince Priebus for, absolutely not.<br> <br>BOLDUAN: In the spirit of transparency, will you release your e-mails? <br> <br>SPICER: No, it's none of your business. Will you give me yours? I mean I - there's - I mean that's a silly question. The Dems got caught -<br> <br>BOLDUAN: You said there would be something, though.<br> <br>SPICER: No, no, the Dems got caught red-handed and now the onus is on us to release our e-mails? Whoa, time out. This is absolutely ridiculous. The Democrats got caught rigging a system for Hillary Clinton. She couldn't win 2008, so they rigged the system for her. Everybody was on board. And now suddenly we have to answer for it and the Russians are to blame? Give me a break. At some point people have to say, they need to own up to the fact that they did this. It's not everybody else's fault. One scandal after another, it's everybody else's fault.<br> <br>BOLDUAN: Are they win - are they -<br> <br>SPICER: The vast right wing experience (ph) the RNC.<br> <br>BOLDUAN: Are they owning up -<br> <br>SPICER: George Bush. The Russians.<br> <br>BOLDUAN: Are they - are they owning up to it by -<br> <br>SPICER: No.<br> <br>BOLDUAN: By Debbie Wasserman Schultz being out?<br> <br>SPICER: No, they're - Robbie Muck's (ph) out there talking about, you know, how the - he's concerned about the Russians, dah, dah, dah. You should be concerned that Hillary Clinton had a server with top secret classified information and it could potentially get out and threaten national security. That's what you should be concerned about. You should be concerned about, despite all the talk that you gave to Bernie Sanders about a transparent system, you rigged it. That's what people should be concerned about. <br> <br>BERMAN: Can you just be clear, because I'm having a hard time telling by the tone of your voice - you're not?<br> <br>BOLDUAN: I can tell. I can tell right here.<br> <br>BERMAN: You're not going to release your - you're not going to release your e-mails? <br> <br>SPICER: No, I am not releasing my e-mails. I said that. I mean, frankly, that's ridiculous. <br> <br>BERMAN: No, we were just - look, we were (INAUDIBLE) -<br> <br>BOLDUAN: We're having fun. Calm down right now. <br> <br>SPICER: I know, we're having fun.<br> <br>BERMAN: The Democratic National Committee is getting a lot of focus right now -<br> <br>SPICER: They are. They deserve it.<br> <br>BERMAN: Because memos that they wrote internally went public. And you could say a lot of organizations were, all of a sudden, if their e- mails went public, they'd be embarrassed. <br> <br>SPICER: I'm sure. I mean I know that there's been leaks of media organizations and corporations in the past. I get it. But the fact of the matter is, they came out very strongly throughout this cycle talking about the fact that it was not rigged. That they had no predisposition to Hillary Clinton. And what happened is, is they got caught in a lie. They got caught rigging the system. And that's - I mean, no one else should have to answer for it except them. <br> <br>But the bigger problem that we're going to see on the floor all wee is not one peon resigning or a bunch of e-mails. It's the fact that there is a huge ideological drift in the party here from the extreme far left to the far left. They has substantive issues. It's not just about how the system was run. It's about real differences between where a good chunk of this party is this week. <br> <br>BOLDUAN: Last week the - we - last week did not go exactly as you had - as you had designed. I know you can knowledge that. So are you careful in what - in your criticisms so quickly of how this convention's going to go? <br> <br>SPICER: No, I think we had some hiccups. There's no question about it. But look where we came out. Your own poll this morning shows us up 7 points. It's the first bounce for a presidential campaign since 2000. I feel really good about the message that we delivered. The poll on CNN after Donald Trump's speech, 76 percent thought it was a great speech and were more inclined to vote for him. I like that. I think I - hey, look, the bar has been set. We set it last week. And I'm glad to put up their convention against ours. <br> <br>BERMAN: Sean Spicer.<br> <br>BOLDUAN: Sean Spicer had his coffee this morning. <br> <br>BERMAN: Great to have you, Sean.<br> <br>BOLDUAN: Or he just happens when he sits next to me.<br> <br>SPICER: Oh.<br> <br>BOLDUAN: Our special coverage continues with John King right now. <br> <br>[12:05:01] Hi, John. <br> <br>JOHN KING, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome to this special edition of INSIDE POLITICS. I'm John King. <br> <br>As you can see right there in these beautiful pictures, we're live inside the CNN Grill in Philadelphia, just outside the convention hall, where Hillary Clinton will make history this week. But she has a few problems as we await what could be a high drama opens session. Problem number one, Donald Trump now enjoying a big bounce from his convention, holding a five point national lead now in our new CNN poll, while also boosting his standing on major issues like the economy and terrorism.<br> <br>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)<br> <br>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I'm comparing myself to Hillary. And we know Hillary and we look at her record. Her record has been a disaster. And I am running against Hillary. It's not like I'm running against the rest of the world. <br> <br>(END VIDEO CLIP)<br> <br>KING: Problem two, well, Democrats have a mess on their hands. <br> <br>(VIDEO CLIP)<br> <br>KING: That same mess might well turn into a controversy for the Trump campaign. Hacked Democratic Party e-mails cost the party chairwoman her job. She was right there getting booed. And now the question is whether Russian is meddling in our campaign with an eye on helping Donald Trump. <br> <br>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)<br> <br>PAUL MANAFORT, TRUMP CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN: I don't even know what you're talking about. It's crazy. The fact that we're having this conversation is the wrong conversation. The conversation we should be having is, what does Russia have from Hillary Clinton's server? <br> <br>(END VIDEO CLIP)<br> <br>KING: Three is more of a question maybe than a problem. Bernie Sanders is saying all the right things and team Clinton is grateful, trust me, but can the Vermont senator, who speaks tonight on opening night, can he persuade his supporters to set their anger aside? <br> <br>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)<br> <br>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D), VERMONT: So what is revealed now is not a shook to me. I think the focus though that I am going to go forward on right now is to make sure that Donald Trump, perhaps the worst Republican candidate in the modern history of this country, somebody by (INAUDIBLE), somebody by ideology, must not become president of the United States. <br> <br>(END VIDEO CLIP)<br> <br>KING: On the first day here at the Democratic National Convention, with us to share their reporting and their insights, "The Atlantic's" Molly Ball and three of my CNN colleagues, Manu Raju, Jeff Zeleny, and Maeve Reston. <br> <br>As we noted here, it's day one at the Democratic National Convention. It is a huge, to borrow a favorite Trump word, week for Hillary Clinton. And, well, it's already a little off the rails. <br> <br>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)<br> <br>DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ, DNC CHAIRWOMAN: So I can see there's a little bit of interest in my - in my - my being here and I appreciate that interest. <br> <br>We know that the voices in this room that are standing up and being disruptive, we know that that's not the Florida that we know. The Florida that we know is united. <br> <br>(END VIDEO CLIP)<br> <br>KING: United, right, that's what that was. That's soon to be former Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. She was speaking this morning to her own home state Florida delegation. And as you can see, she was being booed, heckled by maybe half of the people in the room. Expect more of the same if she sticks to her plan, against the wishes of the Clinton campaign, to gavel the convention to order a little later this afternoon. Why are the delegates so mad at Wasserman Schultz and why was she<br> <br> forced to resign yesterday? Well, that's a plot for a Tom Clancy novel or maybe a James Bond movie. The DNC e-mail server was hacked. Russia is the lead suspect. And the e-mails show the national party's staff was routinely and repeatedly critical of Bernie Sanders at a time Wasserman Schultz and the DNC was insisting it was an honest broker in the primary process. It's a mess and the timing the horrible for Secretary Clinton.<br> <br>Donald Trump, look here, got a healthy bounce out of his convention. New numbers today from our brand new CNN/ORC poll, Donald Trump, 44 percent. Hillary Clinton, 39 percent. Libertarian Gary Johnson at 9 percent and the Green Party's Jill Stein at 3 percent. <br> <br>So, number one, that bounce tells you, it's one poll, candidates traditionally get a bounce, but that's a healthy bounce for Donald Trump, which raises the stakes here. And maybe by the time we get to tonight's program, which is an a-list program, this will pass. But Debbie Wasserman Schultz still plans, as of his moment, to walk into that hall, Jeff Zeleny, at 4:00 and bang this session. Will she get the message from the Florida delegation and blink, or are we going to see this with thousands of people in the room? <br> <br>JEFF ZELENY, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: I mean there are 49 other states where there are Bernie Sanders supporters. So I think she'll get that message amplified. That is one of the reasons so many Democrats across Philadelphia here are scratching their heads, what is she thinking? I've heard so many people today at a breakfast I was at, other people you bump into doing reporting saying, this isn't about her. Does anyone - has anyone told her this isn't about her? It's about nominating the Democratic ticket here. So I do think that they are prepared for her to be booed and then move on. <br> <br>I mean the ironic thing is tonight's theme, today's theme is a unity ticket. Bernie Sanders is a headliner. Elizabeth Warren, actually, is delivering a keynote address here. So the whole idea was supposed to be coming together and she, I'm told, is insistent on gaveling in the convention, which is, you know, just a normal business matter, and then I'm also told she'll be speaking. <br> <br>[12:10:12] That is still up for debate. There are four more hours for that to be worked out.<br> <br>I was in the hall last night at 11:00 last night. She walked in to do a walk-through, walked across the stage all alone. It looked to me like she would getting ready to prepare for some type of a speech. <br> <br>MANU RAJU, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL REPORTER: And as Jeff has been reporting, the Clinton campaign wants nothing to do with this. Robbie Mook just had a press conference talking to a bunch of reporters and I tried to ask him, do you have any concerns with Debbie Wasserman Schultz speaking? He would not answer that question.<br> <br>KING: But then why didn't they stop it? Why didn't they stop it? They cut a deal with her yesterday. She negotiated the terms of surrender, if you will. The president called her to say, gee, thanks for a good job. Secretary Clinton called her and said, gee, thanks for a good job. She got - they allowed her to still gavel this in and to take a few minutes to speak. Why? Why? If the Clinton campaign doesn't want her there, if they want this message of unity, I suspect Donald Trump would say, you're fired. <br> <br>MOLLY BALL, "THE ATLANTIC": Right. It actually really does call their ability - their control over this process into question. Their control over the party. Their control over the convention. All of the Democrats who were - who were laughing last week at Trump, you know, the boos on the convention floor, not for Trump, but - and the division of the delegates, now they really have to eat their words because if Debbie Wasserman Schultz gets up on that stage, it is going to be a spectacle. She is going to get booed. And - and to your point, the Clinton campaign wishes that she would disappear. That she wouldn't do a delegate breakfast. That she wouldn't insist on gaveling it in. But, you know, Debbie Wasserman Schultz - in a way this is the consequences of many, many years of neglect at the DNC and the president not taking the time to take action about this many years ago when she was already a problem. <br> <br>KING: Democrats being Democrats is how a lot of Democrats are describing this. But she could take control and I assume she could say go and she would have to go, but she hasn't. I doubt this is going to fix anybody's votes in November. Ah, Debbie Wasserman Shultz pro or con in November. But, Donald Trump's having fun with this. He's on Twitter today saying, "crooked Hillary knew everything that her servant was doing at the DNC. They just got caught and they all - they all laughed at Bernie." And Debbie Wasserman Schultz this morning saying at that thing, oh, I got a call from the president, I got a call from Hillary, it seems sort of oblivious what she is saying right there. But one of the key dramas here and I made at the top, I think it was a joke, that this could be a Tom Clancy novel or a James Bond movie -<br> <br>MAEVE RESTON, CNN NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER: Scandal plot (ph). <br> <br>KING: But Evan Perez, our justice reporter - scandal plot - a little inside baseball from Maeve there. Go on the web and try to figure it out. They - is that our justice correspondent says Russia is the prime suspect here into - into hack into the system. <br> <br>ZELENY: Which, that's why the politics, the sight of all this, today's drama really doesn't matter. This is the most fascinating story that's happening here, that Russia is trying to play here in this presidential campaign. There are a lot of connections to the Trump campaign. We have no idea that it was orchestrated. This is something you probably cannot orchestrate. We've seen the Trump campaign struggle to orchestrate a lot of things, but this is no question by a lot of reporting that Russia/Moscow interested in playing in this election in some degree. <br> <br>RESTON: And it's interesting to think about how that plays for Trump because in many ways, you know, the - part of the reason why he got a big bounce in his polls, because he's doing much better with independents, but the bigger this scandal gets and the more facts we learn about it, I mean it may cause people to kind of think, oh, well, if Putin really wants Trump in the White House, like what are we getting ourselves into. And, you know, clearly Donald Trump hasn't shied away from that per say on the trail. I mean he's praised Putin and so forth. But just in a time of so much unease and anxiety, I'm quite sure how that plays. <br> <br>RAJU: And listen to how - what Donna Brazile, the interim chair, said last night, expect more of this.<br> <br>ZELENY: Right.<br> <br>RESTON: Right. She said it's just the beginning.<br> <br>RAJU: This is not - these e-mails are just the tip of the iceberg.<br> <br>But I do think that beyond - the Debbie Wasserman Schultz thing aside, there is that lingering tension between the Bernie Sanders supporters and the Hillary Clinton camp that just has - it has not been fully healed yet from the primary. There were other delegation breakfasts where I'm told that speakers got a rather hostile reception from Bernie Sanders supporters. Will that play out on the floor this week? Maybe not. But, still, there is that concern.<br> <br>KING: Erin Burnett tried to ask this of Paul Manafort. Paul Manafort is the Trump campaign chairman. He is a lobbyist who once worked for the Ukrainian strongman close to Vladimir Putin. So that's where people say, ah-ha, connect the dots. Again, if you brought this script to Hollywood, I think they'd laugh at you. But the Justice Department thinks Russia was involved. Is Putin just trying to cause mischief? Is Putin trying to help Trump? Paul - Erin Burnett put the question to Paul Manafort. Here you go. <br> <br>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)<br> <br>PAUL MANAFORT, TRUMP CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN: It's just absurd. I mean Donald Trump is running for president of the United States. Donald Trump is talking about the failed leadership of the Obama administration. This - I don't know anything about what you just said. You may know it. If you do, then you ought to expose it.<br> <br>(END VIDEO CLIP)<br> <br>KING: It's -<br> <br>BALL: Well, it's just - it's just kind of funny to hear a campaign that has promoted all kinds of unfounded conspiracy theories about, say, the JFK assassination, now trying to say, oh, this is a conspiracy theory, there's no evidence for it. Well, there is evidence for it. And I have to say, like, the Trump campaign doesn't have to have any knowledge of this or be involved in it for there to be some kind of mischief making on the part of the Russians or people affiliated with the Russians, and that is what the experts appear to be saying right now. <br> <br>[12:15:12] KING: A fascinating moment. Bernie Sanders speaks tonight to this point. It will be key to see if he can get his delegates in line, put their anger down. We'll watch how Debbie Wasserman Schultz gets treated in just a little bit here. We'll continue the conversation next.<br> <br>Next, do Democrats need a tougher tone on security issues? And what does Hillary Clinton mean when she says that's a quote, "Hillary standard"? <br> <br>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)<br> <br>[12:20:05] KING: Welcome back. <br> <br>One big goal this week here in Philadelphia is to paint Donald Trump as a risk America can't afford to take. So, you might call this a bit of a warm-up act. Hillary Clinton speaking last hour to the VFW Annual Convention in Charlotte. <br> <br>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)<br> <br>HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I have confidence. I have optimism. I don't understand people who trash talk about America, who talk about us as being in decline, who act as though we are not yet the greatest country that has ever been created on the face of the earth for all of history. If you want somebody who will scapegoat other people, pedal fear and smear, I'm not your candidate. I'm interested in bringing everybody together. <br> <br>(END VIDEO CLIP)<br> <br>KING: Tough criticism there, Hillary Clinton of Donald Trump. And one interesting thing to watch as this week plays out is how the tone here on law and order and security issues like terrorism compares to Trump's tough-talk in Cleveland. Democrats from Clinton on down, as you just heard there, call Trump a fear monger. But look here, in our new poll, Donald Trump now has a big edge over Hillary Clinton, 53 percent to 42 percent, when voters are asked which candidate is best to handle the issue of terrorism. That's part of the Trump bounce. It was fascinating in that speech to the VFW, Hillary Clinton closed by saying, "many of you in this room," veterans, older men for the most part in that audience, "might have some trepidation about a woman as commander in chief." And she talked about how Eleanor Roosevelt told women who want to get involved in public life to develop thick skin. She views mostly the women's issues as an advantage to her in this campaign, but that was interesting. <br> <br>ZELENY: It is interesting and it's something that we don't hear her talking about a lot. We talked a lot about in her first campaign, 2008, and how she was reluctant to ever even mention the fact that she would be a historic president. Now the campaign is doing much more of that. we're going to hear a lot of that epic convention tonight. And she is getting more comfortable talking about the fact that, you know, that history is hanging in the balance here, but also why some people have a problem with it. And she's trying to bring them along here.<br> <br>She's probably right, but that's one of the reasons that, you know, the campaign is a little bit worried about the white working class male problem. Yes, they have the Obama coalition. Yes, several people will argue that, you know, President Obama had some issues with white working class men as well. But they believe that, you know, her Illinois Methodist upbringing should make her more attractive to some of these voters. So far she's struggled with that. <br> <br>RAJU: Yes, you just look at that poll -<br> <br>RESTON: And her numbers took a dive in - in our poll that we had out this morning, again, among those white working class voters. <br> <br>KING: Right.<br> <br>RESTON: And I think to Trump's security edge, she's clearly making the argument that she has a lot of experience as secretary of state, but you do meet people on the campaign trail who say, I don't know about having a woman as commander in chief. Like those people do exist out there. There aren't as many of them, but, you know, clearly what people heard in Donald Trump's speech on Thursday night was that he's connect with their fear, connecting with their anxiety. <br> <br>KING: Right.<br> <br>RESTON: They, you know, talking to voters this weekend, they say, I'm really worried about who he'd actually surround himself with. I'm not sure what he would do. So that's worrisome. But I still think he would be stronger in Hillary Clinton in some cases and so that's the case she really has to make here is, you know, that he's erratic, that he's inexperienced and - and I don't know about all of the happy talk about, you know, she's trying to connect with anxiety, but also saying that things are better than Donald Trump has (INAUDIBLE).<br> <br>RAJU: It's interest -<br> <br>KING: Hang on just one second.<br> <br>To that point I want to play a little bit more of Hillary Clinton; She was subtle at times in her speech, saying, hey, I worked in the Senate with John McCain, reminding the V - the veterans in the room, probably didn't need to remember that Donald Trump mocked John McCain, a prisoner of war. But then she - then she very much said, I will consult with you, I will consult with the generals. I will be in touch. I'm a broad-based person, but not Donald Trump. <br> <br>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)<br> <br>HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: They deserve a commander in chief who will never order them to commit war crimes. I believe in listening to our generals and admirals because they have invaluable knowledge and experience and they're doing one of the most important jobs there is, commanding America's sons and daughters. As commander in chief, I will always show them respect and hear them out. You will never hear me say that I only listened to myself on national security. <br> <br>(END VIDEO CLIP)<br> <br>KING: It's a big part of this week's theme. Essentially he's a loose cannon. He can't be trusted. And, God forbid, you put him in the situation room. RAJU: And one of the things that the polls do show is that people believe she has more experience than Donald Trump, and so they're going to make that argument that she's ben more - better qualified and to push back on the point that maybe, you know, she's a woman, not - people maybe have some trepidation in electing her to lead the armed forces. They're going to try to make the point pretty clear that she has the temperament to be commander in chief. That's why you could hear some more measured tone while also criticizing Donald Trump. <br> <br>[12:25:10] BALL: But looking at the themes of this convention, looking at the roster of speakers, I looked at the whole thing that we know so far, and we don't know all the speakers yet, but it's really striking how little presence there is of law enforcement, of military. You have, I believe, one general, former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, and I believe that's a - there's a prosecutor on there. But, you know, given how heavily Trump hit these themes of crime and terrorism, and clearly there's some resonance to that, even though everybody called it this dark pessimistic vision -<br> <br>KING: Absolutely. Right.<br> <br>BALL: Crime may not be up, but fear of crime is at a 15 year high in America -<br> <br>RAJU: And -<br> <br>BALL: And so if she wants to stress those issues and stress being a steady hand on the - on the tiller, it's all of tonight's speakers are about pocket book concern, domestic issues. There's not -<br> <br>KING: Well, let's - let's look at that, because I agree with you completely, they better address what Trump did. If you don't like what Trump said about law and order and security, they better counter argue it here because Trump's moving in the polls.<br> <br>But to that issue, let's look at the lineup tonight. This is an a-list lineup tonight for the Democrats. You have Senator Elizabeth Warren, a liberal icon. You have Michelle Obama. She's kind of popular in the Democratic Party, the first lady of the United States. And Bernie Sanders, who, of course, is critical to Clinton tonight as she tries to win over the Sanders' supporters. That is largely - Michelle Obama will make the case about what it's like to be in the White House, the values she thinks you need in the White House. But the others two are blue collar, Democrats, progressive liberals. <br> <br>Look at this polling right now. Again, Donald Trump, 54 percent. Hillary Clinton, 43 percent, when voters are asked, who would best handle the economy. The economy's almost always issue number one in an election. So he beats her on the economy. He beats her on terrorism. And to the point Maeve was making earlier, and this is why I think Warren and Sanders are critical, look at the split on education right now. Among white college graduates, it's Clinton 44 to Trump's 39. But among white, non-college graduates, Trump leads 62 to 23. That's that white, working class, blue-collar voter that if you go across the rust belt, including this state of Pennsylvania, go across over to Wisconsin or Minnesota, that's your problem. RAJU: And that's why she's spending the her after the convention in<br> <br> Ohio, in Pennsylvania, going right after that demographic that is viewing her increasingly suspiciously. <br> <br>RESTON: And she certainly hopes that Kaine will help with that demographic, to Jeff's point earlier about, you know, putting them forward as a ticket, that is, you know, focused on faith and good Midwestern values. We'll certainly see more of that. <br> <br>ZELENY: And she's hoping that Elizabeth Warren makes that case tonight.<br> <br>Interestingly on the lineup tonight, there is some internal discussions here about why does Elizabeth Warren have a - the marquee speech? Her speech is known as the keynote speech. It's scheduled right now to be the final speech, the final word of the night. Some Bernie Sanders supporters are like, wait, what about us? We should be in that position. My guess is thought that, you know, Bernie Sanders will make - he's the more important speech probably in terms of bringing his people along. Then you talk to those Bernie Sanders voters, that is, you know, the ones who still aren't sure about her. But, you know, the - if you talk to some Clinton strategists about these white, working class voters, cynically they will say, we need to improve somewhat but the country is changing so much, the dynamics are changing so much, we don't need to win all of them. And they won't. <br> <br>KING: And if, that's assuming, they can turn out African-Americans and Latinos -<br> <br>ZELENY: That's why Michelle Obama's on.<br> <br>KING: At the pace - at the pace that President Obama did in 2008 and 2012. They've got to come very close to that. <br> <br>One other glaring number from our poll. I want to show this. Hillary Clinton, is she honest and trustworthy. Thirty percent say yes, 68 percent say no. That's an all-time high on the no, or I guess an all- time low, if you will. That's 7 in 10 Americans. Seven in 10 Americans think the Democratic nominee for president of the United States is not honest and trust worthy. <br> <br>ZELENY: That includes a lot of Democrats in that number. <br> <br>RESTON: Yes, I mean -<br> <br>KING: There's no way to get to that number without a lot of Democrats.<br> <br>RESTON: It includes the people that you talk to who are supporting her. Who say, you know, sometimes some of them say the lesser of two evils. Others say, I'm just really not sure what happened with that whole e-mail thing. She operates under a different system. And that's why the "60 Minutes" interview was so interesting where she talked about there being a Hillary standard that she's held to -<br> <br>KING: Right. RESTON: Versus another standard for other people. So she's really going to have to work on that and it's - it's hard to imagine if she hasn't been able to fix that so far, how she does it from here.<br> <br>ZELENY: Right.<br> <br>KING: But let's - let's listen to that because this is - I covered the Clinton White House. I get what she's talking about. I'm not so sure it's smart to talk about it. Let's listen.<br> <br>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)<br> <br>HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: But I often feel like there's the Hillary standard and then there's the standard for everybody else, and -<br> <br>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What's the Hillary standard? <br> <br>CLINTON: Well, unfounded, in accurate, mean-spirited attacks with no basis in truth, reality, which take on a life of their own. <br> <br>(END VIDEO CLIP)<br> <br>KING: It's true that there have been a lot of attacks against Hillary Clinton by Republicans over the years. Some of them have gone beyond the pale of facts and deep into fiction and hyperbole and conspiracy theory but - but I believe the secretary of state, she had a private e-mail server and the FBI director said she was reckless and careless with sensitive information. Plus, she's been in public life for a long time and some people -<br> <br>ZELENY: It's a fine line -<br> <br>RAJU: I mean it's to -<br> <br>ZELENY: With the vast right-wing conspiracy that we heard -<br> <br>RESTON: Right.<br> <br>ZELENY: Back in the day, and this. No one wants her to say that. But, yes, of course it's true, you know, that she - there is a different tenor. But some of her supporters and (INAUDIBLE) kind of cringe when she says that because it gets to the point of -<br> <br>[12:30:02] KING: Right. The woe is me.<br> <br>ZELENY: Poor Hillary. <br> <br>KING: No one feels -<br> <br>RESTON: Why would you not make -<br> <br>RAJU: The FBI director clearly contradicted several of her public assertions -<br> <br>ZELENY: Right.<br> <br></p>

inside politics starts right now. %$* 168
john berman, sitting in today. %$* 168
is jeb bush really ready to run? %$* 169
an iraq war question leads to the latest hiccup for the former florida governor and an attempt at damage control. %$* 169
if we're all supposed to answer hypothetical questions. %$* 161
knowing what we know now, what would you have done, i would not have gone into iraq. %$* 161
the 2016 gop pack piles on. %$* 169
i wouldn't have gone to war but we don't get replays. %$* 192
the new jersey governor is back, and despite trailing his republican counterparts, he says don't write him off just yet. %$* 169
my political obituary has been written a number of times before so we take our chances if we want to. %$* 192
meanwhile democratic divorce: senators break from president obama over the transpacific trade deal, but don't worry, he has new friends to keep him company. %$* 169
i would like to thank the president, too. %$* 193
no, you are not hearing things. %$* 193
president obama has done this country service. %$* 193
inside politics, the biggest stories sourced by the best %$* 169
reporters now. %$* 169
cnn's nia-malika henderson; jonathan martin of the "new york times"; margaret talev of bloomberg news; and from the "washington post" robert costa. %$* 194
in case you have not noticed, running for president is hard, even if you are not actually officially legally running yet. %$* 194
just ask jeb bush. %$* 194
by now he would probably be glad to answer any question other than would you have gone to war in iraq in 2003 knowing what you know now? %$* 194
the first time he got that question he said yes, then it was time for damage control. %$* 194
i admired the men and women, mostly men, that made the ultimate sacrifice. %$* 161
so going back in time and talking about hypothetical what would have happened and what could have happened, i think does a disservice for them. %$* 161
ok then -- no hypotheticals. %$* 169
try again. %$* 169
of course, you know, given the power of looking back and having that, of course, anybody would have made different decisions. %$* 161
there is no denying that, but to delve into that and not focus on the future i think is where, you know, i need to draw the line. %$* 161
by the end of the week the bush "yes" had crossed the line to become a "no". %$* 169
if we are all supposed to answer hypothetical questions, knowing what we know now, what would you have done? %$* 161
i would not have engaged, i would not have gone into iraq. %$* 161
so knowing what we know now, would you say this represents a serious stumble for the jeb bush not yet officially a campaign? %$* 169
robert costa, let me ask you, instead of saying is it a stumble, let me ask how serious? %$* 169
we are still early in the process and i think governor bush has time to recover. %$* 178
but this has shown his political rust. %$* 178
he hasn't been on the ballot since 2002. %$* 178
he's still adjusting to the rapid pace of politics today. %$* 178
and he is also really grappling with the legacy of his brother. %$* 178
how does he not distance himself from his family and still use their network but also cast himself as his own man? %$* 178
his brother. %$* 169
since you brought up his brother, let me play you one thing he had to say about his brother and his father and being part of the bush family. %$* 169
i am not going to go out of my way to say, you know, that my brother did this wrong or my dad did this wrong. %$* 161
it's just not going to happen. %$* 161
i have a hard time with that. %$* 161
i love my family a lot. %$* 161
so jonathan martin, is this a bush family thing or is this an iraq thing? %$* 169
i submit -- %$* 169
is there a difference? %$* 52
i do think there might be. %$* 169
i think he went into this answer, the reason he perhaps gave the answer he did at first is because he thought this was a bush family thing. %$* 169
i'm not going to put distance between me and my brother, when in fact, it's a bigger issue that matters to a lot of people. %$* 169
you are on to something. %$* 52
you can listen to the tone of his voice and detect a resentment that he is being put on the bush family couch. %$* 52
he basically was saying i am not going to play psychologist here or let you play psychologist and talk about family drama so you can then go and write umpteen bush breaks from bush columns and stories. %$* 52
that to me was driving his reluctance. %$* 52
at least at the beginning and that was somewhat understandable. %$* 52
but what's not understandable is after days and days of this, when it's clearly a problem and what everyone of his opponents are saying, of course, we would not have gone in. %$* 52
but he still would not do it. %$* 52
and that to me gets at the larger problem which is that he just does not want to re-litigate this stuff, but he is going to have to because he is the younger brother of the last gop president. %$* 52
it's a fact. %$* 52
i am getting notes from insiders, from money men, from party people saying they are concerned. %$* 169
this raises concern amongst them that jeb may not be running this team very well, that the structure may not be in place yet to handle situations like this. %$* 169
that's right because that was the thing here. %$* 173
why wasn't he prepared for this basic question that he knew he was going to get. %$* 173
and it took him four or five chances. %$* 173
you imagine that they think they've sort of dealt with it but you imagine if he runs in 2016, that you're going see ads, you know, one answer here and another answer there. %$* 173
you know, i do sympathize with jeb bush in this way because it %$* 173
must be awfully hard to run against your brother. %$* 173
you know, sort of the psychological drama of running against your brother -- someone you might not be close to but you are also really close to and you love them but you've had disagreements with them. %$* 173
so in that way it's hard but this is what he signed up for and this is what he has to do. %$* 173
but you know, also, it's a little more complicated because of course, in his pre-campaign campaign. %$* 171
he has brought in as advisers and backers and supporters and shapers of what is going to be his platform, many of the folks supported the war in iraq. %$* 171
and so that does add another degree of complication i think for him. %$* 171
you know who this really helps this whole week with governor bush, it helps marco rubio. %$* 178
i mean the freshman florida senator is casting himself as the gop future, someone from a new generation. %$* 178
rush limbaugh was raving about rubio this week, a lot of conservatives seem to be forgetting the immigration problems from 2013 for rubio. %$* 178
and when they're looking to the fresh face and they wonder should they go in that direction, bush's stumble really reiterates why rubio and other young contenders like governor scott walker have real appeal. %$* 178
i remember, you know, eight years ago barack obama saying we want to move beyond baby boomers and vietnam. %$* 169
maybe it's marco rubio who said i'm the guy to move us beyond iraq to an extent. %$* 169
but i also thought it was interesting, nia, this was sort of the first candidate feeding frenzy. %$* 169
they smelled the blood in the water and they all jumped in. %$* 169
that's right. %$* 173
and you all saw them out there. %$* 173
chris christie, of course out there saying let me be clear, this is what i would have done. %$* 173
you have not seen that before. %$* 173
you haven't seen them be so ready to go out and attack jeb bush, and they have in some ways in sort of ways in saying i am not from a family of a famous last name. %$* 173
but i do think they smell blood in the water. %$* 173
and if you talk to donors, you talk to folks behind the scenes you keep hearing rubio, you keep hearing walker and you keep hearing this sense of what maybe jeb is a little too rusty. %$* 173
he certainly didn't feel comfortable -- didn't seem like he was comfortable out there. %$* 173
can he fix it? %$* 169
he fixed a narrow issue over iraq, yes. %$* 52
the broader issue is still there. %$* 52
and that's why you saw these candidates jump on him this week. %$* 52
they weren't seizing on the question of the iraq authorization from '03. %$* 52
they were seizing on the opportunity to make jeb bush a candidate of the past, of yesterday. %$* 52
and that's what obama did so effectively against hillary in '08 and that's why i think you see all these candidates gleefully this week get all over bush. %$* 52
i want to shift gears if i can quickly to another candidate right now. %$* 169
since we're talking about jeb bush who occupies that mainstream lane. %$* 169
let's talk about chris christie for a second right here because he is still considering a run, and he had a fascinating interview last week with our jake tapper. %$* 169
and his wife was there, too, and she talked in really interesting terms about the excitement level for this campaign. %$* 169
let's listen to what she said. %$* 169
i mean it certainly is disappointing when you have throngs of people encouraging you to do this, and maybe the enthusiasm isn't as crazy as it was. %$* 192
that's remarkably candid from the wife of somebody who may run for president, saying the enthusiasm now isn't what it used to be. %$* 169
martin luther king jr. and then barack obama talked about the fierce urgency of now. %$* 169
margaret it seems like what mrs. christie is saying is the fierce urgency of now was then. %$* 169
it might have been 2012. %$* 169
he's not done. %$* 171
he is clearly not ready to hang this up. %$* 171
and i think he does see an opportunity with jeb's stumble to try to get back into new hampshire. %$* 171
but it's difficult. %$* 171
we just did polling -- bloomberg did polling last week about how the race looks in new hampshire. %$* 171
it's a four-way race. %$* 171
it's not chris christie in that top four. %$* 171
but if he can use this as an opportunity, you know, he's going to try to make the most out of that and we will see him there tomorrow on monday. %$* 171
robert, you think that the new hampshire people are telling that he could be a town meeting guy. %$* 169
he could be the mccain type who goes there and gets people excited at a small level and that ultimately becomes a bigger thing. %$* 169
i spent time with him recently on the trail in new hampshire. %$* 178
when you see governor christie and you just step back and watch him -- this is a political town. %$* 178
he overwhelms voters and donors with liveliness, his personality. %$* 178
he's seen as someone who can win over the working class, suburban voters -- just the kind of candidate the republicans were looking for a few years ago but he is still plagued by these scandals. %$* 178
and as he starts to move closer to a run, you're going to have more indictments perhaps, at least trials for his former aides. %$* 178
jonathan -- who tells him, if it is over, if he doesn't have a real chance, how does that play itself out? %$* 169
who says to him, governor christie, it's just not happening? %$* 169
i think you played a clip of that person. %$* 52
i think mary pat --  his long-time political adviser. %$* 52
but look, they see as to a lot, they see a fluid race, they see jeb as more vulnerable than expected, and so they say what many say over the years, why not me? %$* 52
berman:  you have a one in a million chance is what %$* 52
you are saying is -- i have a chance? %$* 52
all right guys. %$* 52
sit tight. %$* 52
up next for us -- the great divide, not among republicans but the new one among democrats. %$* 52
but first, "politicians say the darnedest things" as the prospective first gentleman visits david letterman and wonders if he will be invited back into the white house. %$* 52
she has to win the nomination. %$* 149
if she wins the nomination, she has to win the election. %$* 149
and if she wins the election, the chances are 100 percent i will be back -- wait, wait, if i'm asked. %$* 149
this is inside politics. %$* 169
i am john berman in this week for john king. %$* 169
barack obama, welcome to the final stretch of your presidency at least as far as party loyalty is concerned. %$* 169
what a break between the white house and the elizabeth warren wing of the democratic party. %$* 169
you know, the issue with respect to myself and elizabeth, has never been personal. %$* 40
there a whole bunch of some of my best friends in the senate as well in the house and some of my earliest supporters who disagree with me on this. %$* 40
so those friends took warren's side, or some might say, elizabeth's side, during a trade vote last week, leaving the president alone with his new found friends, mitch mcconnell or mitch and the republicans. %$* 169
so margaret, the micro issue here to an extent has largely been solved. %$* 169
they're going to vote the senate is going to vote on the trade issue here, ultimately. %$* 169
but what about the macro issue, have the democrats or at least congressional democrats -- have they left the president now? %$* 169
this has been like a slow-moving train, right, since what 2009. %$* 171
but there are a couple of things that work. %$* 171
one is that labor and obama always started out sort of on uncertain footing. %$* 171
and you remember a big part of what joe biden was doing way back when he convinced labor that obama is the guy that they can work with      he's freed from the constraints of having to run for re-election %$* 171
or having to try to keep democrats in power now. %$* 171
and as he said, he is doing what he thinks is right. %$* 171
on the warren question though, it's a little bit different, there's is nothing personal, but there kind of is right, because you remember she was the one who stood up to the consumer financial protection board and then, you know, they couldn't close the deal with here and she had to remake herself and ran for the senate. %$* 171
things have always been a little tense ever since then. %$* 171
and as someone watching this fight, who is pretty interesting here jonathan and that's hillary clinton. %$* 169
you know, a lot of people are looking to her and saying, hey, what do you think about all this? %$* 169
her silence is deafening on the trade deal. %$* 52
and i think, you know, she is on the record supporting it when she was secretary of state, but now she does not want to get crosswise with organized labor, and with the left more broadly by coming out for it. %$* 52
and that has put the president in a tough spot, and i think a lot of democrats especially in a sort of more moderate establishment are starting to get a little bit anxious about hillary's silence on the issue. %$* 52
she's going to iowa this week. %$* 52
i have a feeling she'll be asked about it again. %$* 52
so far she sort of punts it. %$* 52
let's see what she says this week. %$* 52
we're going to talk about her overall silence at greater length in a moment here. %$* 169
but her silence on this issue, nia, does she have to take a stand and how perilous is it for her? %$* 169
look, you know, her husband was the nafta guy. %$* 169
she was a big nafta person. %$* 169
nafta got her in trouble in 2008. %$* 169
that's right. %$* 173
i mean they have said, listen, they will comment on this once the whole thing is done, and until then they feel like they can stay on the sidelines, and whether or not that is true we will have to see. %$* 173
they are also worried about not only being crosswise with the sort of the warren wing, which used to be sort of the obama wing of the democratic party. %$* 173
they are worried about being seen as crossways with obama. %$* 173
they don't want to be too -- not seen as not giving him political cover as well. %$* 173
so it's a very tricky situation for her. %$* 173
i think we will have to see what she says next week in iowa. %$* 173
but this is between, you know, sort of warren and obama for her. %$* 173
and that's the tightrope she's going to have to walk. %$* 173
here's the thing, we have to wait to see what she says but she doesn't say much about anything which people have started to notice here that she doesn't take a lot of actual campaign-type questions. %$* 169
and jeb bush who's had his own issues here among other people who have been critical of how little mrs. clinton has been saying. %$* 169
listen to what jeb said. %$* 169
that's all part of the process. %$* 161
you can't script your way to the presidency and put yourself in a protective bubble and never interact with people. %$* 161
only talk to people that totally agree with you and have it all scripted out. %$* 161
it's not going to work. %$* 161
so robert, does she need to be taking more questions from us, from actual real people? %$* 169
does she need to get out there more or is it maybe smart to be in this sort of the bubble right now? %$* 169
as a political athlete to get ready for the general election she's eventually going to need to take some more questions and get in fighting shape for whoever the republican nominee ends up being. %$* 178
but right now here only real challenger is senator sanders from vermont. %$* 178
beyond that you have warren on the sidelines pressuring her on trade, but martin o'malley is not even in the race yet, so she is not under real pressure beyond from the press and some activists. %$* 178
so you think she's going to take these -- she's going to take -- %$* 169
she'll take them but she is running a disciplined campaign, picking her spots, talking about what she wants to talk about whether it's small business in iowa this coming week or just really talking about what she says, everyday americans, and recasting herself as a regular person. %$* 178
and she does know that these everyday americans are not necessarily tuning in right now. %$* 173
and they're certainly not going to be angry that she is not taking questions from people like us. %$* 173
i mean in some ways this is sort of a press story in some ways. %$* 173
i think eventually and i mean you're obviously seeing bush jump on this idea that she is not taking questions. %$* 173
at some point she's going to have to get out there, but i think for now people are not tuned in. %$* 173
i think democrats though sort of wondering why she is not doing more of this, too because they think it actually could help her if she's been more aggressive in terms of getting out her message, for example, when she was in nevada doing immigration news two weeks ago. %$* 52
you know, why not while you are out there, do an interview with univision or some spanish language network. %$* 52
they are playing a very sort of confident version -- i'm sorry -- cautious version of politics right now. %$* 52
it's not hurting her but it's starting to raise a buzz. %$* 52
nia said, you know, it makes people like us upset -- people like us, the press. %$* 169
but isn't her problem one of her big problems are people like us. %$* 169
doesn't she need to work the media to a certain extent more than she is? %$* 169
yes. %$* 171
in the long term, yes. %$* 171
and probably in the medium term. %$* 171
i think jeb's stumble on iraq though has been destructive for her on two levels. %$* 171
one is that when you got -- ok maybe you can't script everything but you know, when you just say what you are thinking, uh, right? %$* 171
and then when you have the legacy of your family, bill clinton and nafta, you know george bush and iraq. %$* 171
you have to answer for that eventually. %$* 171
and when you answer for it before you're ready, you get in trouble. %$* 171
on the other hand, if you sit all the way through a primary with sort of not comparable competition, if you get into the general if you are not running against the guy with the other family legacy, you got a problem. %$* 171
so that's her calculus. %$* 171
she'll answer questions. %$* 169
the question is when. %$* 169
all right guys. %$* 169
sit tight. %$* 169
next, a sneak peek. %$* 169
our reporters share from their notebooks and get you out ahead of the coming political news, including what a current first lady might do to help a former first lady who is running for president. %$* 169
all right. %$* 169
let's head around the inside politics table and ask our reporters to share a nugget from their notebooks. %$* 169
nia -- let's start with you. %$* 169
democrats are buzzing about the possibility of the first ladies club in 2016. %$* 173
and that michelle obama throwing her support in sort of an oprah winfrey, ted kennedy-esque way in 2016. %$* 173
democrats obviously know the power of michelle obama. %$* 173
she was very much dominating the twitterverse this past week because of the comments she made about historical black college and university. %$* 173
she also sent out a note to the dnc's mailing list. %$* 173
the problem is she really hates campaigning, right, and that is very well known, but there is sort of a wildcard in this, and that is a woman named christina  who used to work for michelle obama and now works for hillary clinton. %$* 173
if someone can convince michelle obama to do what its public or  and the prospect of extending her husband's legacy as well. %$* 173
that would be big. %$* 169
all right -- jonathan martin. %$* 169
the iowa gop is going to fore with its quadrennial summer straw poll this summer in august. %$* 52
and we know that jeb bush is not going to be competing there. %$* 52
we are waiting to hear if scott walker will or won't compete there, but it's important to put a finer point on what exactly compete means? %$* 52
because a lot of these candidates are trying to figure out that they're going to do. %$* 52
from what i understand, candidates like marco rubio, for example, may show up to speak there at the event because there's going to be thousands of activists there they want to reach. %$* 52
but i am told that rubio, at least, absolutely positively according to on of his advisers will not spend money to bus supporters there. %$* 52
so competing there, what does that actually mean? %$* 52
does that mean actually spending money or just showing up to speak? %$* 52
important difference. %$* 52
setting the bar very, very low. %$* 169
margaret? %$* 169
talev:  keep your eye on obama unfiltered. %$* 169
this is like obama %$* 169
4.0. %$* 169
he hinted a little bit to us last year that things are going to be different. %$* 169
this year it's the fourth quarter, things get interesting in the fourth quarter. %$* 169
we really started to see it in his rhetoric the last week or so, you saw it on trade with him calling elizabeth warren out just as any other politicians, saying democrats are wrong. %$* 169
you saw it on race issues in this future georgetown university, talking about poverty, everything from the pain of his own father leaving to what he thinks about how fox news feels about poverty. %$* 169
you'll even be seeing him in dealing with issues sports, the new england patriots deflategate. %$* 169
and so i am looking ahead to next week even as soon as tomorrow when the president is in camden, new jersey and having a visit with a community policing programs just to look at how far they've come in terms of racial progress. %$* 169
he's talking a lot more frankly about how he thinks and how he feels. %$* 169
interesting. %$* 169
all right -- robert. %$* 169
i spoke with former u.s. ambassador to the united nations john bolton this past week. %$* 178
and he decided not to run for president. %$* 178
he was always going to be a long shot contender. %$* 178
but he gave me a hint about what he is going to do in the coming months during the primary. %$* 178
he is going to be spending about $6 million to $7 million to make sure his hawkish perspective gets out there and a door in the debates even though he won't be participating. %$* 178
but he also in the general election, he wants to do this political action committees and his presence to go up against secretary clinton should she be the democratic nominee. %$* 178
and he has a different kind of relationship with her. %$* 178
he was a classmate of clinton's at yale law school, and he called her quote, "a radical" in our conversation and he thinks he's going to make that point in a lot of ads this fall. %$* 178
decades of experience. %$* 169
the bolton not running thing is a good segue into my point here about who is running. %$* 169
in the next few weeks, to some degree, we expect martin o'malley, rick santorum, rick perry and george pataki to have made their presidential candidacies clear. %$* 169
what do they have in common? %$* 169
well, not many people give them a chance which makes me think back to november 2011 when i interviewed rick santorum about his first presidential campaign and i spent a significant part of the interview nothing again and again, and again that not many people thought he had a chance. %$* 169
my exactly questions included -- why aren't you doing better in the polls and why isn't your message catching on. %$* 169
less than two months later, he won iowa. %$* 169
so there, he won other states too and for a time, he was a genuine threat to take the nomination. %$* 169
he had a chance. %$* 169
i was wrong in learning that perhaps we should see how they run before we call the race. %$* 169
so candidates lace up those shoes and have at it. %$* 169
that's all for inside politics. %$* 169
thanks for sharing your sunday morning with us. %$* 169
"state of the union" starts right now. %$* 169

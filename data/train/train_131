inside politics with john king starts in just seconds. %$* 168
ted cruz on the rise in iowa. %$* 53
it's certainly true that going up is better than going down. %$* 228
donald trump under fire. %$* 53
the republican front- runner has made a name for himself in the last months by trafficking in prejudice and paranoia. %$* 149
republicans rush to call trump's plan to ban muslims way out of bounds. %$* 53
but trump defends the idea and himself. %$* 53
i am the least racist person that you have ever met. %$* 5
the big debate tuesday -- trump and terror fears are the biggest flashpoints. %$* 53
inside politics -- the biggest stories sourced by the best reporters now. %$* 53
welcome to inside politics. %$* 53
i'm john king. %$* 53
thanks for sharing your sunday morning, as we count down to the big republican presidential debate tuesday night right here on cnn. %$* 53
julie pace of the associated press, ed o'keefe of the "washington post", cnn's jeff zeleny, and abby phillip of the "washington post". %$* 177
donald trump is all about winning. %$* 177
just ask him or listen to just a minute or two of any speech or trump interview. %$* 177
so what happens if trump starts losing? %$* 177
it's a big question this sunday morning, because of a brand-new iowa poll commissioned for the des moines register. %$* 177
take a look here. %$* 177
texas senator ted cruz first place 31 percent; trump a distant second at 21 percent; ben carson slips to third at 13; marco rubio at 10; and jeb bush at 6 -- rounding out the top five. %$* 177
now, the cruz surge is a big threat to the central premise of the trump candidacy and the moment is frankly more than delicious. %$* 177
iowa holds the kickoff caucuses in 49 days. %$* 177
the final debate of the year is tuesday. %$* 177
and cruz just got caught being everything he says he isn't, meaning kind of a typical politician. %$* 177
in public cruz says trump's terrific and that he isn't going to attack. %$* 177
but in a speech he perhaps quite foolishly thought was private, he suggested trump and carson weren't fit to be commander in chief. %$* 177
who understands the threats we face? %$* 228
who am i comfortable having their finger on the button? %$* 228
and that's a question of strength, but it's also a question of judgment and i think that is a question that is a challenging question for both of them. %$* 228
and so, here we are. %$* 53
it's a safe bet cruz gets asked to turn to mr. trump and say that to his face tuesday night. %$* 53
and he either does and invites the wrath of the human chainsaw or he looks weak or maybe two-faced, like the "say one thing, do another thing" politicians ted cruz has made his name railing against. %$* 53
mr. zeleny, you were out on the trail with mr. trump this week. %$* 53
we do have, it's just a fabulous moment where on that debate stage, we know trump doesn't like to lose, and now we know cruz is going to be called out for, i'm going to call that his not quite mitt romney 47 percent. %$* 53
but ladies and gentlemen, you live in the 21st century. %$* 53
there are no such things as private fund-raisers. %$* 53
where are we? %$* 53
we are at a moment of a potential change in this race. %$* 15
i was in iowa with donald trump on friday, talking to a lot of voters. %$* 15
and even before this poll came out, they -- a lot of people in that room who waited hours to see donald trump, a lot of them said, hey, i'm also still considering ted cruz. %$* 15
so this number for ted cruz says 31 percent in the iowa poll this morning is terrific news for him. %$* 15
but even more, 51 percent say he is their first or second choice. %$* 15
right. %$* 53
but, as you said, it's 49 days before the iowa caucuses. %$* 15
is ted cruz peaking too soon? %$* 15
is he sticking his head up? %$* 15
he's had such a methodical, strategic campaign -- was that recording and is this poll actually going to make him a target? %$* 15
yes, it is. %$* 15
not just for donald trump, though. %$* 15
everyone suddenly is going to be going after him. %$* 15
marco rubio certainly is. %$* 15
chris christie certainly is. %$* 15
and this campaign now is ending on a topic different from what we thought it would be on terrorism. %$* 15
it is such a focus of this. %$* 15
so ted cruz will be under the spotlight for that in las vegas on tuesday. %$* 15
i don't think he'll use it as a moment to take on donald trump. %$* 15
i think he would be foolish to do so, but he has enough arrows coming at him. %$* 15
cruz is a different kind of candidate, because of the evangelical tea party base. %$* 53
but if he gets asked, you said that in private, are you saying mr. trump does not have the judgment to be commander in chief? %$* 53
you don't trust him. %$* 53
you told your donors, you don't trust him to have his finger on the button. %$* 53
if he punts at that moment, does he look weak? %$* 53
well, we all remember that tim pawlenty moment from 2012, where he had said something about mitt romney the day before and then got asked and basically whipped on it. %$* 170
obamneycare. %$* 53
health care -- right. %$* 15
and for cruz, this is so important, because so much of his candidacy is about authenticity and saying what he means. %$* 170
"i'm a committed conservative. %$* 170
i'm not going to be waffling." %$* 170
he's a truth teller. %$* 53
"i'm a truth teller." %$* 170
so this is now a recording of him. %$* 170
he can't walk away from the fact that he said it. %$* 170
at the same time, he has been very smart in handling donald trump and knowing that if he can draft off of his support for a while, that he could rise to this position. %$* 170
so we know that trump and cruz have had this bromance. %$* 53
and trump always says i won't hit you until you hit me. %$* 53
or we should have the caveat -- until you threaten me. %$* 53
he sees the cruz rise coming. %$* 53
listen to donald trump in iowa the other day. %$* 53
he knows that a lot of ted cruz's support in that state comes from the very critical evangelical constituency. %$* 53
donald trump just wanted to help them out with the bio. %$* 53
so i think we're going to do -- we're doing really well with the evangelicals. %$* 5
and by the way, again, i do like ted cruz, but not a lot of evangelicals come out of cuba, in all fairness. %$* 5
it's true. %$* 5
not a lot come out. %$* 5
but i like him nevertheless. %$* 5
help me. %$* 53
what is -- dog whistle -- what is the point here? %$* 53
ted cruz is not caucasian? %$* 53
yes, yes, yes. %$* 197
zeleny:  -- which comes as a surprise to no one -- %$* 197
nobody. %$* 197
-- because he's been in iowa so often. %$* 15
that fell flat in the room, i can tell you. %$* 15
yet, that's exactly what he's trying to do. %$* 197
it's also a bit -- it's the trouble that i think trump has in going after cruz. %$* 170
trump has been very one note. %$* 170
when someone threatens him in a state, he goes after them personally. %$* 170
the difference here is that trump supporters don't like jeb bush. %$* 170
they don't necessarily like marco rubio. %$* 170
they do like ted cruz. %$* 170
if trump starts going after cruz, it could ricochet back on him as well. %$* 170
and as part of all of this - - one of the interesting conversations, and i think it will get more interesting because of the prospect of trump starting to lose and what does he do? %$* 53
does he lash out? %$* 53
he could be a traditional politician and say, cruz is going to get iowa, i'm going to go camp out in new hampshire and try to play the chess that most candidates play. %$* 53
but that's not the trump name. %$* 53
trump is about winning. %$* 53
one of the things he's talked about as republicans say, is this going to drag on, are we going to have an open convention if nobody has the majority. %$* 53
how do we block trump? %$* 53
trump and carson didn't like that conversation. %$* 53
they started talking about hey, wait a minute. %$* 53
if you're going to start doing backroom deals, we might leave. %$* 53
listen, you're going to see donald trump at the top of the hour on "state of the union". %$* 53
here's a bit of what he told jake tapper about the idea should he stay as a republican no matter what or bolt? %$* 53
i've been hearing about it. %$* 5
i've been hearing about these closed-door meetings and i don't like that. %$* 5
that wasn't the deal i made. %$* 5
i signed a pledge but the pledge was a double deal. %$* 5
they're supposed to be honorable. %$* 5
so we're going to find out. %$* 5
if it's that way, they're going to have problems. %$* 5
but i hope it's not going to be that way. %$* 5
define problems. %$* 53
i think you can expect donald trump to get pretty nasty. %$* 153
i mean he's been able to do it successfully and not actually get hurt politically. %$* 153
and i think that he would probably make good on his promise to bolt if he doesn't like the deal that they strike. %$* 153
he's in this to win it and he touted this poll last week where some 31 %$* 153
percent of the people who support him say that they would leave, but most of them would stay with him if he left. %$* 153
and that's a huge problem for the republican party. %$* 153
he knows that and i think he's planning on using that if push comes to shove. %$* 153
leverage, if nothing else. %$* 53
but two things. %$* 197
first, the mechanics of doing this, you know, the deadlines are approaching. %$* 197
so if he wants to do this, he's got to start making decisions about that. %$* 197
and that's, you know, a potential roadblock. %$* 197
the other -- there was a very refreshing moment i thought on friday when arizona senator jeff flake was on another network like this and said that the reason that republicans keep saying, you're not answering the question about will you support him if he's the republican nominee, is he said, the reason we don't want to say no is that that will fuel the idea that he leaves and runs as a third party candidate. %$* 197
we would rather him realize through this nomination process that he's a loser than just have him lose the race than have him jump and run as a third party candidate and ruin our chances. %$* 197
a very candid and factual statement that i think a lot of the top-tier establishment elected republicans are thinking -- that you cannot goad him into dropping out and becoming a third party candidate. %$* 197
well, he is, as i said, the human chainsaw. %$* 53
and they worry about him because he's so good. %$* 53
that's not a criticism, actually. %$* 53
not in the sense that he knows how to use the tv age and his celebrity. %$* 53
everybody, sit tight. %$* 53
up next, will the final debate of this wild year be the last debate for one or more of the struggling republicans? %$* 53
first, though, you'll want to watch this. %$* 53
a billionaire and a bald eagle meet and walk away with this week's politicians say and do the darnedest things. %$* 53
how's my hair? %$* 5
ok. %$* 5
0840 %$* 5
welcome back. %$* 53
trump, bush, walker, rubio, carson -- that was way back in august. %$* 640
let's slide the calendar and jump forward. %$* 640
debate number two -- you noticed? %$* 640
trump still on top; then it was carson, bush, cruz, rubio -- walker, gone. %$* 640
trump, carson, rubio, bush, cruz. %$* 249
a little bit of consistency here -- especially these two, big at the top. %$* 249
then, before number four, we come over here. %$* 249
hello, bush way down here -- trump, carson, rubio, cruz, bush. %$* 249
we head into the fifth debate, just drop the remote. %$* 249
leave it right here on cnn tuesday night. %$* 249
bush is still way down here. %$* 249
you've got trump and now cruz has moved up into second place. %$* 249
ed o'keefe, you've spent a lot of time with governor bush -- i'm new at this -- but i don't think you're supposed to be going that way. %$* 249
right. %$* 197
he's on a sled ride right now. %$* 197
and as the debate tuesday night that is -- %$* 53
absolutely critical. %$* 197
every one of these has been for him because of how poorly he mismanaged his expectations coming out of the first one. %$* 197
but big, big sense in bush world that he absolutely cannot afford anything that resembles a gaffe. %$* 197
has to at least sustain himself, you know, keep it status quo. %$* 197
find a way to point out that trump is someone he considers unserious and unqualified to be president. %$* 197
but absolutely, positively don't do anything that would upset the apple cart even more. %$* 197
i mean he continues to be on this slide. %$* 197
he saw a modest 1 percent improvement in that des moines register poll. %$* 197
he is sitting at about fourth or fifth place in all of these polls. %$* 197
the way his team sees it, we would rather be there than lower than that, but you've pretty much hit the floor. %$* 197
ok. %$* 53
yes, well he's right at the cusp of being in the junior varsity debate when we move into the new year. %$* 53
we do know that in the substance of this debate, there'll be a lot of foreign policy, especially focused on terrorism, because of paris, because san bernardino. %$* 53
you were out reporting there this past week. %$* 53
a lot of it will be about terrorism. %$* 53
and one of the things that has stirred the controversy is donald trump coming out and saying after that, that we should have at least a territory ban on muslims entering into the united states. %$* 53
now, if you look at the public opinion polling, six in ten americans say that's a bad idea, republicans are about evenly split on it. %$* 53
trump's worried right now about republicans and listen to how he sells it. %$* 53
we have to stop the muslims until we find out what's going on. %$* 5
does that make sense, by the way? %$* 5
until we find out -- %$* 5
playing to the crowd there. %$* 53
and opposing him, you mentioned, jeb bush needs to prove that donald trump's not serious enough, qualified to be president. %$* 53
the problem is, here's jeb bush trying to make that case and you see if you can figure out the problem. %$* 53
it's not about the blowhards out there just saying tough. %$* 161
that's not a program, that's not a plan. %$* 161
this is serious business. %$* 161
this is both a shameless and a dangerous idea. %$* 149
we betray the efforts of the past if we fail to push back against bigotry in all its forms. %$* 40
the one thing you know about trump is he has clarity. %$* 53
whether you agree or disagree with him, he is clear about what he says. %$* 53
and if you're jeb bush or any other republican standing up and saying you're wrong on this issue, donald, you're siding with hillary clinton and barack obama. %$* 53
what are the three things republican base voters dislike the most? %$* 53
their own establishment, the president of the united states and hillary clinton. %$* 53
that's right. %$* 153
and it's hard to figure out what the alternative is that jeb wants. %$* 153
talking to voters this week, i was actually a little surprised by how many republicans said that they like the general idea of what trump is proposing. %$* 153
they may not want to say, yes, i totally agree with blocking all muslims from coming into the united states, but they are in line with that general trajectory of thought. %$* 153
and that's where trump is going. %$* 153
and i think there's not a whole lot of room for jeb bush in that space. %$* 153
i mean, i don't think he's going to get a whole lot of kudos from republicans for, like you said, siding with hillary clinton and barack obama. %$* 153
and one of the other problems for republicans, is no matter what they say about trump's proposals, hillary clinton and barack obama are going to cast them all under the same umbrella. %$* 170
so it's a kind of a lose-lose situation. %$* 170
they lose with his voters, but they also lose with maybe some of the more moderates or independents who are going to be assumed to have lumped them in all together. %$* 170
to your point, trump sounds, you know, whether you disagree or agree with the policy, he sounds strong, he sounds decisive. %$* 53
he's going to do something. %$* 53
and republican voters don't think this president is doing anything. %$* 53
no question. %$* 15
and that is what voters say. %$* 15
i was in south carolina when trump was announcing this ban of muslims, this proposed ban, and people who say, look, we don't like everything he says, necessarily, but so far, nothing he said has convinced me that i'm not going to support him. %$* 15
so i think that this is very popular inside this republican base, no question about it at all. %$* 15
there's safety in numbers in some respects. %$* 15
i do think that jeb bush and others will get some sort of grown-up points by saying, look, this is not a good idea. %$* 15
but voters are fine with it, by and large, because they are worried and frightened, and they also know it's not actually going to happen. %$* 15
this is a proposal here. %$* 15
and donald trump knows exactly what he's doing, politically speaking. %$* 15
if you add up kasich, rubio, bush, christi, and carly fiorina, you get trump. %$* 53
and in the debate tuesday night, does somebody in that center middle group decide, i'm not going after trump, i'm not going after cruz, i need to emerge as the alternative. %$* 53
i'm going to have a middle of the road fight here? %$* 53
you know, jeb bush tried that two debates ago and it didn't go very well. %$* 197
he tried to hit marco rubio. %$* 197
so i think at this point, they would probably be better served just keeping their eyes on trump, and to some extent, ted cruz; and by doing that perhaps you emerge as the alternative because you clearly make an argument against those other guys. %$* 197
and i will say this. %$* 197
while within the republican party he may enjoy plurality of support or a good chunk of support for this idea, i have heard increasingly at bush events, and we know where bush sits in the numbers, but i've heard from republicans who show up, i am concerned about what trump is saying. %$* 197
it's time for this to end. %$* 197
we have to be more serious about focusing on someone else. %$* 197
and then you talk to the people about who you're thinking about, and they say, bush, christi, or rubio. %$* 197
and that right there is the race in new hampshire, at least for the establishment. %$* 197
one of those three has to get out on top, and that guy probably goes farther. %$* 197
we're getting close to the voters actually getting to do this themselves. %$* 53
stay put, our reporters share their notebooks next, including talk of a white knight or knights if republicans do end up with a muddled field -- maybe a contested convention. %$* 53
let's head around the inside politics table and ask our great reporters to get you out ahead of the big political news just around the corner. %$* 53
julie pace. %$* 53
i spent most of last week in new hampshire, talking to folks in the republican establishment, and there's a lot of concern among these folks that voters in new hampshire are not going to coalesce around one of the candidates in that wing of the party in time for the primary, essentially leaving trump the opportunity to take a plurality of the vote. %$* 170
you have chris christie building a lot of momentum, but he's competing with three or four candidates for those votes. %$* 170
and right now there's no organized effort underway to try to push a john kasich or jeb bush out of the race before the primary, but there are some preliminary discussions happening about what that wing of the party will do if all of those candidates want to come out of new hampshire and continue on. %$* 170
and two of the names i heard a lot about were paul ryan and mitt romney, not to run, but essentially to have a come to jesus conversation with these candidates and come up with a process for winnowing down that part of the field. %$* 170
yes, ok.  that would be fun. %$* 53
great -- good luck with that. %$* 53
ed. %$* 53
so john, debates are always a good time for members of the party to get together and talk about other things before the big show. %$* 197
on monday in las vegas, a bunch of hispanic conservative activists are going to be holding meetings with some of the presidential campaigns to go over their immigration policy and talk about other issues. %$* 197
representatives of the bush, the rubio, the cruz, and the paul campaign -- the carson campaigns will be meeting with this group. %$* 197
this is the same group of hispanic conservatives that showed up at the last debate and denounced donald trump and said that this has to stop. %$* 197
they're looking to learn more from the other candidates. %$* 197
maybe at some point they'll make an endorsement. %$* 197
might not carry a lot of water, but it would definitely allow the person that gets that endorsement to make a general election argument, you know, if i'm able to draw hispanic support, perhaps i'm the one we should be nominating. %$* 197
it would be an important signal there. %$* 53
jeff. %$* 53
well, it's too early to talk about an exit strategy or is it for some of these people. %$* 15
more and more, we're hearing from top donors and supporters and some of these presidential candidates you were talking about, julie, how long are they going to go here? %$* 15
they made it to the end of the year and is it time to save face? %$* 15
there's still time to get out of this process before the voting begins. %$* 15
and one person you hear over and over is jeb bush. %$* 15
his campaign will say, no, not at all, no chance we will stay in through iowa, new hampshire, and beyond. %$* 15
we have a path. %$* 15
increasingly, a lot of his donors do not believe that that is true. %$* 15
so this is the most critical week of this campaign, i believe, for jeb bush. %$* 15
the rise of ted cruz, only intensifies this conversation among party leaders because for all that worry about donald trump, there's equal worry about ted cruz being the party's nominee. %$* 15
so watch stage right to see if anyone is on the verge of leaving. %$* 15
it's been a terrible year for jeb, he needs to end it on a better note. %$* 53
abby. %$* 53
i just got back from spending a week and a half in san bernardino. %$* 153
and that investigation continues to expand in ways that i think are pretty surprising. %$* 153
a lot of it's pointing to perhaps an intelligence failure which puts ted cruz in a really tough spot. %$* 153
he's supported the national security agency's intelligence -- or program that would roll back some of their intelligence-gathering efforts. %$* 153
and it's not just rubio that's going to be hammering him on that. %$* 153
we'll see chris christie coming out of the woodworks. %$* 153
he's rising in new hampshire, and this is, he thinks, his central issue. %$* 153
so we'll see who else can maneuver on that issue. %$* 153
and who knows, maybe donald trump will jump into the fray as well. %$* 153
yes. %$* 53
another test of how cruz can take a punch that he's heading up. %$* 53
i'll close with a bit more on the cruz momentum and its impact as jeff just talked about on the republican party 2016 thinking. %$* 53
most top party strategists now view a cruz iowa win as a near lock, and no one thinks of him as a one-state wonder because of his fund-raising success and the combination of tea party and evangelical appeal. %$* 53
and so as a cruz path to the nomination is debated, many of those strategists, just as they do about donald trump, think a cruz at the top of the ticket would be a disaster for gop senate candidates in blue and purple states, like new hampshire, wisconsin, and ohio next year. %$* 53
now, the cruz camp calls this typical misguided establishment hand- wringing, but the worries that either trump or cruz will top the ticket are real enough that they play into what jeff and julie were talking about just a moment ago -- conversations nationally and in new hampshire about whether there's any way to squeeze out a couple of the center-right candidates asap. %$* 53
but given the eagles involved and the unpredictability of the past year, most establishment strategists now assume that moment of truth does not come until right after new hampshire. %$* 53
that's it for inside politics. %$* 53
again, thanks for sharing your sunday morning. %$* 53
we'll see you soon. %$* 53
"state of the union" with jake tapper, live from vegas starts right now. %$* 53

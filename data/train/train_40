the only way the terrorists can win is if we lose our nerve. %$* 161
this isn't going to happen on my watch. %$* 161
supreme speculation:  the chief justice keeps them guessing about his future. %$* 116
critics respond to new reports about the cia leak by demanding karl rove's resignation from the white house. %$* 745
dennis moves on and so do gulf coast residents, somewhat battered, but also relieved. %$* 746
we did what we could, boarded up our house and sought shelter in a safe place and made it through ok. %$* 22
now, live from washington, cnn's inside politics. %$* 116
thank you for joining us, i'm candy crowley. %$* 164
here in washington, the tea-leaf readers are working overtime today while the powers-that-be are getting back to business. %$* 164
congress is returning from its july 4th break with lawmakers wondering if and when chief justice william rehnquist will announce he's retiring. %$* 164
new reports about rove's connection to the leak of a cia operative's name. %$* 747
the "washington post" quotes rove's lawyer as saying, "his client spoke with at least one reporter about a secret agent's role at the cia without revealing her name." %$* 747
and "news week" reports that rove was the secret source who gave "time" magazine reporter matthew cooper permission to testify before a grand jury last week. %$* 747
we begin with the rove story and our white house correspondent, suzanne malveaux -- suzanne? %$* 747
well, good afternoon, candy. %$* 307
what he meant to do, what he was trying to do was give cooper and "time" magazine a heads up that this was a false story, that joe wilson was not authorized by the cia, not authorized by vice president dick cheney to go before and have this investigation on whether or not iraq was trying to obtain uranium from africa. %$* 444
but rather, this was coming from wilson's wife valerie plame, who apparently works at the cia on these weapons of mass destruction matters. %$* 444
this is what luskin said earlier today in our phone conversation. %$* 444
he said, "a fair reading of coopers e-mail suggests that what karl was trying to do was to discourage "time" from reporting allegations that's proved to be false, not to encourage them to publish anything about wilson's wife." %$* 444
and then, luskin goes on to tell us, of course, that he did not mention valerie plame's name in that e-mail, in those exchanges with matthew cooper. %$* 444
he also says that he was not aware that she was a secret cia operative. %$* 444
how far would you go? %$* 748
how much would it take to make that connection to say that this is wilson's wife and to actually identify her by name? %$* 748
now, the white house in previous occasions, scott mcclellan on numerous occasions, seeming to clear karl rove and others who have been before the grand jury, saying that he even spoke with him. %$* 748
he said that he was not involved in this at all. %$* 748
today, the white house taking a very different stand... %$* 748
well, those overseeing the investigation expressed a preference to us that we not get into commenting on the investigation while it's ongoing and that was what they requested of the white house. %$* 314
and so, i think in order to be helpful to that investigation, we are following their direction. %$* 314
so, candy, the white house mum on this issue this afternoon, saying that this is what they got from prosecutors, that they don't want them to talk about this publicly any more. %$* 307
i should let you here, when look at all this and try to make sense of it, of course, the main consideration here, the big question of whether or not karl rove committed a crime, has to do with intention. %$* 307
whether, in fact, he knew, deliberately decided that he would give information to that reporter that would either reveal her identity or that she was a secret operative. %$* 307
his lawyer and rove both say that, that is not the case, that he did not know her position and that he did not disclose her name -- candy? %$* 307
crowley:  suzanne malveaux at the white house. %$* 307
thanks, suzanne. %$* 307
now to the other shoe that may or may not drop at the supreme court. %$* 307
much of the city is on rehnquist watch, including lawmakers on the hill and our congressional correspondent, ed henry -- ed? %$* 307
good afternoon, candy. %$* 308
for now at least, the president is focused on whom he will nominate to fill the seat of sandra day o'connor on the high court and while he does that, senate democrats have been demanding consultation, so consultation they will get. %$* 308
if fact, tuesday morning the president will host the senate democratic leader harry reed, as well as senator patrick leahy, the top democrat on the senate judiciary committee, over at the white house tomorrow morning along with the senate majority leader bill frist and the senate judiciary chairman arlen specter to start the ball rolling on this process; reach out across the aisle. %$* 308
and this meeting comes as rumors continue to spread in this town, as you mentioned, like wildfire about whether or not the president will have a second nomination to make, whether or not chief justice william rehnquist will step down. %$* 308
that perhaps justice o'connor could be coaxed out of retirement if in fact reinquist steps down and the president decides to name her as chief justice. %$* 249
this could be a good move that could bring the country together, because of justice o'connor's history of moderation. %$* 249
senator leahy, though, said:  this is one of just many rumors and unlikely to happen. %$* 249
that was one of the rumors. %$* 598
well, as you know, last week -- last week there were more rumors than you ever heard. %$* 598
i had one reporter tell me that the latest rumor was that 15 or so of the nine justices would resign on tuesday. %$* 598
now senator specter's suggestion though, is likely to cause more heartburn among conservatives who were upset about justice o'connor's tilt to the center over the years. %$* 308
conservatives also a little weary about senator specter, who's a well-known moderate steering the course of these confirmation hearings. %$* 308
conservatives also have been expressing concern about the possibility of two supreme court picks for the president, whether he might try to split the difference, pick a more moderate. %$* 308
perhaps somebody like attorney general alberto gonzales for one of the seats, then pick a more conservative if, in fact, rehnquist were to step down. %$* 308
that would not change the tilt of the court at all. %$* 749
basically, you'd still have a more centrist and a more conservative pick there. %$* 749
yesterday, the former senate judiciary chairman, orin hatch, tried to allay the concerns of conservatives... %$* 749
i think he's dedicated to picking conservatives, but mainstream conservatives, people who vote conservative are qualified, competent people who -- of good temperament, good integrity and good education and knowledge. %$* 409
and i think -- i think that he will. %$* 409
i think he'll pick two conservatives. %$* 409
now, i just spoke to senate majority leader bill fist -- frist,  who literally just got off a plane from a long trip in africa that he took over the congressional recess. %$* 308
he looked weary, but said he's ready for tomorrow's meeting. %$* 308
he said he has a list of names he's looking forward to sharing with the president. %$* 308
on the other side of the aisle, senate democratic leader harry reed said he's not planning to bring any more names to the white house, but he would like the president to give some names to the democrats, let them have some ideas of exactly what kind of justice he might want to pick for the o'connor seat. %$* 308
some interesting comments about timing, telling reporters:  he wants to send a message to the white house that while some republicans have been saying this process should move quickly, harry reed is determined to make sure it go slowly. %$* 750
he does not want them to try to push through a justice to quickly. %$* 750
and he even said that this nominee might not be ready for the first monday in october. %$* 750
as you know, in her retirement letter, justice o'connor said that she will stick around until a replacement is confirmed. %$* 750
so she could conceivably stay on the court -- candy? %$* 750
all of which, ed henry, sounds like you are kind of on permanent stand by for any sort of news from the supreme court. %$* 164
24/7. %$* 308
thanks a lot. %$* 164
president bush today conveyed a new sense of urgency to the war on terror, after the attacks in london. %$* 164
speaking at the fbi's training academy in virginia, mr. bush expressed solidarity with the people of britain and he promised anew that america will not retreat from the fight against terrorists, wherever they might be, particularly in iraq. %$* 164
we will keep the terrorists on the run until they have no place left to hide. %$* 161
in the war on terror, iraq is now central front. %$* 161
the terrorists fight in iraq because they know that the survival of their hateful ideology is at stake. %$* 161
while the president keeps making that point, fewer americans seem to be buying it. %$* 164
our just-release poll shows 54 percent of those surveyed, now say the war with iraq has made the u.s. less safe from terrorism. %$* 164
that is up from 39 percent last month. %$* 164
but mr. bush's also overall approval rating doesn't seem to be suffering because that. %$* 164
in fact, it has inched up there points to 49 percent in the last week-and-a-half. %$* 164
we'll have more ahead on the president's remarks today and the politics of the war on terror. %$* 164
it's a perfect storm here in washington for speculation about the supreme court. %$* 164
coming up, the rumors that flying about who will replace one justice and whether another is calling it quits. %$* 164
we'll also discuss the various scenarios and battle plans with two senators on the judiciary committee, republican charles grassley and democrat patrick leahy. %$* 164
and later, hillary clinton goes mad. %$* 164
we are talking, of course, only about the magazine. %$* 164
we're get a read on her latest diss of the president. %$* 164
as washington considers potential replacements for justice sandra day o'connor and the potential retirement of chief justice william rehnquist, i'm joined from capitol hill by republican senator charles grassley of iowa. %$* 164
he is a member of the judiciary committee, which is about to have a lot of work to do. %$* 164
senator, thank you for joining us. %$* 164
glad to be with you, candy. %$* 751
seems to me the conversation now is going in a couple of ways, and one of them has to do with consultation with capitol hill. %$* 164
what, in your mind, is appropriate consultation with capitol hill? %$* 164
should the president ask democrats for who they would like to see on the supreme court? %$* 164
should he take that list seriously or should he hand them a list? %$* 164
what's appropriate? %$* 164
well, first of all, the consultation is not absolutely required by the constitution, but politically, it's a good thing for the president to do. %$* 751
and i think that it ranges from whatever people want to ask the president to consider, and i think that that would be legitimate. %$* 751
what they asked me -- i had conversations with top-level people at the white house last week and they asked if we had any names to suggest. %$* 751
we asked what sort of a person we would want to put on the supreme court. %$* 751
and i was able, in maybe a 15-minute telephone conversation, to give some direction. %$* 751
i think that that's the sort of consultation. %$* 751
and i could have probably gone on for an hour and they would have listened to us. %$* 751
but, you know, that covered the basics. %$* 751
now, i know some democrats have complained that mostly what they've heard now or sort of people who may be on the list, is that sufficient? %$* 164
do you think you're going to get hung up over this? %$* 164
well, i think that the president hasn't made up the list. %$* 751
there's been no list made public. %$* 751
so a list, if one is available, is the figment of imagination of people that want to put lists together until the white house puts out a list. %$* 751
and i don't expect that the white house will put out a list. %$* 751
so you've got people that are supposedly on a list that's somebody else's list and then you got everybody else that anybody wants to suggest that could also be considered on the list. %$* 751
so let me tell you about the other thing that i think sort of is bubbling up into the conversation. %$* 164
and that is this whole idea of interpreting the law versus an activist judge. %$* 164
now, i know that you have made it very clear that you want a judge that interprets the law, rather than makes the law. %$* 164
but in the end, doesn't this come down, really, to the issue of abortion? %$* 164
because you have democrats saying we don't want activist judges, either, who would mess around with roe v. wade. %$* 164
no, it doesn't come down to abortion, because, for instance, the recent court case modifying the right of eminent domain and the fifth amendment, as an example, is very much a constitutional issue as much as abortion. %$* 751
and, you know, strict constructionist applies to anything that's not just constitutional, which is the case of roe v. wade. %$* 751
it's strict constructionist, what applies to the laws that we pass. %$* 751
and the idea behind it is that judges are not elected, they're appointed. %$* 751
and should they be interfering with the legislative process? %$* 751
because if judges interfere with the legislative process, except for impeachment, there's no recourse that the people have in this country. %$* 751
whereas if i legislate and people don't like what i legislate, then they can vote against me in the next election. %$* 751
democratic leader reid has said -- signaled to the white house that he doesn't want to hurry this up. %$* 164
it's sort of raised the possibility that perhaps by the time the court opens in october, they may not have a replacement for sandra day o'connor. %$* 164
is that acceptable? %$* 164
i don't think it's acceptable, because, obviously, when there isn't a confirmation made, that that person is going to have to take office immediately and maybe vote on some cases that justice o'connor heard starting the first monday of october. %$* 751
we need somebody on the bench that's not only going to vote on the cases, but are going to hear the cases. %$* 751
so you see hearings and you would like hearings in september, i take it? %$* 164
yes. %$* 751
they ought to come in september. %$* 751
now, i've got nothing to denigrate senator reid's efforts to make sure that there's a good legislative process in place to give it due constitutional consideration. %$* 751
but where i have gripes about extended debate is you listen to the same thing said ten times over. %$* 751
you know, and points can only be made so often that they serve no useful purpose beyond that point. %$* 751
and that's where we ought to be voting. %$* 751
and i think that we have elongated debates way beyond what's constitutionally necessary to fulfill our role of advice and consent. %$* 751
well, good luck to you, senator grassley, as you try to get everybody not to speak their turn. %$* 164
we'll be watching. %$* 164
thank you so much. %$* 164
senator chuck grassley of iowa. %$* 164
just ahead, separating fact from fiction at the high court. %$* 164
our bruce morton checks the washington rumors about another court retirement and finds a lot of talk and very little substance. %$* 164
it has been the summer of rumors here in washington, all of them, it seems, based on the assumption that it is not a question of if, but when chief justice william rehnquist will retire. %$* 164
but as our bruce morton reports, there have been very few facts to go along with the rumors about another high court vacancy. %$* 164
cameras stake out chief justice rehnquist's house every morning. %$* 321
last friday, i asked are you going to retire today? %$* 321
he answered. %$* 321
that's for me to know and you to find out. %$* 752
he probably knows, all right. %$* 321
we reporters still haven't found out. %$* 321
neither have republican senators on the judiciary committee, who might have better sources. %$* 321
my own analysis is that the chief does not intend to step down as long as his health holds up. %$* 309
having -- being engaged in a bout with cancer myself, i know that it's good to get up every morning and have something that you have to do, something that is important to do. %$* 309
i expect by the end of the year that he will retire. %$* 409
because i think he's really wanted to. %$* 409
that's my sense, but i've been wrong before. %$* 409
sandra day o'connor is retiring; she said so. %$* 321
but what if the president offered to name her chief justice, first woman chief? %$* 321
but i did hear about it, that there had been senators who made that suggestion to chief -- to justice o'connor and the response that i heard was that she said she was flattered, that she didn't say no. %$* 309
i think it would be quite a capping to her career if she served for a time, maybe a year or so. %$* 309
there have also been rumors that justices john paul stevens and/or ruth bader ginsberg might retire, but they've already hired clerks for 2006, so that's unlikely. %$* 321
in washington, everything usually leaks. %$* 321
this stuff doesn't much. %$* 321
in washington, we're used to all kinds of leaks, but here we have two institutions and one person who are incredibly secretive. %$* 753
the white house is very good about keeping things close to the vest. %$* 753
the supreme court itself releases very little information to the public. %$* 753
and an individual justice, including the chief justice, is going to keep their medical condition really close to the vest. %$* 753
and that's why all of this is really just speculation. %$* 753
that's right, best guessing game in town. %$* 321
but if an actual fact should emerge, come creeping out of the building, we're ready to pounce on it. %$* 321
boy, are we ready. %$* 321
bruce morton, cnn, washington. %$* 321
president bush and british prime minister tony blair have further cemented their partnership in fighting the war on terror. %$* 164
but after the attacks on london, is mr. bush talking the same language as his ally in the u.k.? %$* 164
that story ahead. %$* 164
plus, the damage is done along the gulf coast, but do the remains of hurricane dennis pose a threat to you? %$* 164
stay with us for a weather update and much more inside politics. %$* 164
as the markets get set to close on wall street, i am joined by christine romans in new york with "the dobbs report" -- christine. %$* 164
thanks, candy. %$* 369
less than two minutes to go to the closing bell and stocks posting broad gains today, helped by a drop in oil prices. %$* 369
right now, dow industrials up 67 points, 10,517. %$* 369
the nasdaq is nearly 1 percent higher, and the standard and poor's 500 also gaining ground, moving back into positive territory now for the year. %$* 369
oil prices fell 71 cents a barrel. %$* 369
it's now back below $59 a barrel. %$* 369
hurricane dennis spared the offshore production platforms in the gulf of mexico and oil traders responded. %$* 369
but other areas, we're not so lucky. %$* 369
early estimates show dennis caused up to $5 billion in insured damages. %$* 369
that makes dennis less costly than hurricane ivan, which struck last year. %$* 369
dennis basically followed the same path as ivan, but was less destructive because this storm was more compact. %$* 369
jury selection is underway in the first trial against merck involving the company's drug vioxx. %$* 369
that suit alleges merck knew its popular painkiller was dangerous long before pulling it from the market last year. %$* 369
it's only the beginning of a long legal process for merck. %$* 369
the company faces nearly 4,000 similar cases and many more are likely to follow. %$* 369
one analyst today estimated the suits could cost that company as much as $25 billion. %$* 369
amtrak's acela service is finally getting back on the right track. %$* 369
two of the high-speed acela trains went back into limited service today, with two round-trip trains between new york and washington. %$* 369
cracks in the disc-braking system had sidelined the train since april. %$* 369
00 p.m. eastern on "lou dobbs tonight," red star rising. %$* 412
we take a look at china's bold strategy to increase its economic power worldwide. %$* 412
that plan includes gaining a foothold within the united states. %$* 412
the success of china's economy is largely achieved through getting into our economic system. %$* 754
that is, we integrate china's system into our system. %$* 754
and the keyword here is integration. %$* 754
also tonight, homeland insecurity, we take a look at why the u.s.  constantly fails to meet its own security deadlines. %$* 369
then, israel is looking to the united states for major financial aid for its withdrawal from the gaza strip. %$* 369
should american taxpayers foot the bill? %$* 369
we take a look. %$* 369
00 p.m.  eastern on "lou dobbs tonight." %$* 755
now back to candy. %$* 755
thanks, christine. %$* 164
and now back to inside politics. %$* 164
democrats today are pressing president bush to increase the budget for homeland security after the attacks on london. %$* 164
they say the bombings last week drive home the need to protects america's mass transit system and to provide better funding for emergency workers who respond first to terror attacks. %$* 164
with what happened in london, maybe we can finally get the majority to agree with some of the basic needs of this country as it relates to first-responders, and other problems of homeland security. %$* 298
the budget we have now before us from the president and from the majority cuts homeland security by a little more than 15 percent from last year, a cut of approximately half a billion. %$* 298
president bush vowed again today to take the fight against terror to the enemy. %$* 164
and british prime minister tony blair made it a one-two punch, delivering his own speech on terror in london. %$* 164
our senior political analyst bill schneider has the tale of two speeches. %$* 164
george w. bush and tony blair delivered speeches at the same time about the same issue, terrorism, with a similar message, defiance. %$* 317
the attack in london was an attack on the civilized world. %$* 161
and the civilized world is united in its resolve. %$* 161
though terrorists can kill, they will never destroy the way of life we share and we value, and which we will defend with such strength of belief and conviction. %$* 756
both gave a list of terrorist outrages. %$* 317
on september the 11th, 2001. %$* 161
they've continued to kill in bali, in casablanca, riyadh, jakarta, istanbul, madrid. %$* 161
in madrid, bali, saudi arabia, russia, kenya, tanzania, pakistan, yemen, turkey, egypt, morocco, of course in new york on september the 11th. %$* 756
both called for new government powers to combat terrorism, powers that are controversial in both countries, but the two leaders speeches were also very different. %$* 317
both talked about pursuing justice against the terrorists, but in notably different ways. %$* 317
we will pursue those responsible, not just the perpetrators, but the planners of this outrage wherever they are, and we will not rest until they are identified, and as far as is humanly possible, brought to justice. %$* 756
our coalition is bringing our enemies to justice and bringing justice to our enemies. %$* 161
for president bush, acts of terrorism are cause for war. %$* 317
blair never mentioned war, and he never mentioned iraq. %$* 317
bush did. %$* 317
in the war on terror in iraq, it's now the central front. %$* 161
bush talked about preventing terrorism by promoting democratic politics. %$* 317
when the middle east grows in democracy and prosperity and hope, the terrorists will lose their sponsors, they'll lose their recruits. %$* 161
blair talked about appealing to muslim values. %$* 317
blair:  fanaticism is not a state of religion, but a state of mind. %$* 317
and we will work with you to make the moderate and true voice of islam heard as it should be. %$* 317
president bush is marshaling the outrage produced by terrorism to build support for his policies in iraq. %$* 317
prime minister blare is keeping iraq out of it, perhaps because he doesn't want to encourage the criticism that iraq has made his country more vulnerable. %$* 317
bill, i wanted to ask you, i know we have got a couple of new poll numbers out, and i wanted to ask you about them. %$* 164
one is whether there's been any impact on the president's poll numbers, and how people feel about iraq based on the london bombings. %$* 164
well, yes there has been some impact. %$* 317
two weeks ago when we asked americans whether they thought the war in iraq has made the u.s. safer or less safe from terrorism, the public was actually pretty closely split, 43 percent said iraq has made the u.s. safer, 46 percent said less safe. %$* 317
then president bush addressed the nation. %$* 317
after the president's speech, the number who said iraq has made the country less safe went down to 39 percent. %$* 317
then came the attacks in london. %$* 317
they drove up the view that iraq has made the u.s. less safe. %$* 317
by 54 to 40 percent, the public now believes iraq has not made the u.s. safer from terrorism, which is consistent with what we found on the night of the london bombings when a majority of americans said they thought the terrorists attacked london mostly because britain supports the u.s. in iraq. %$* 317
now, at a time of threat, americans always rally to support the president. %$* 317
both the cnn/usa today/gallup poll and the pew poll show a small improvement in president bush's job ratings, 3 points and 5 points respectively, but both of those polls still shows the president's ratings below 50. %$* 317
thank you very much. %$* 164
bill schneider, always on top of it. %$* 164
we appreciate it. %$* 164
now we want to switch back to the big story that unfolded this weekend and the storm ahead. %$* 164
hurricane dennis barreled through the gulf coast causing minimal damage, widespread power outages, and at least one death in georgia. %$* 164
now a tropical depression, let's find out where dennis is heading next. %$* 164
cnn meteorologist jacqui jeras is with us from atlanta. %$* 164
jacqui, what is heading our way? %$* 164
well, it's going to be stalling out really, candy. %$* 757
it's not moving a whole heck of a lot. %$* 757
and that is going to be a problem with flooding across the ohio river valley. %$* 757
right now the center of location right about on the state line between northern mississippi and southern tennessee, off to the east of the memphis area, spreading heavy showers and some scattered thunderstorms which are really starting to pick up in intensity once again across georgia. %$* 757
we have already had plenty of flooding here as well into parts of alabama. %$* 757
let's show you the forecast track of where it's going to be going next. %$* 757
this is where it is right now. %$* 757
it's going to be drifting slowly on up to the north, and this dark blue area is where we're going to see the heaviest concentrations of rainfall, likely on the order of three to six inches. %$* 757
that will gradually glide a little bit more toward the eastward by wednesday morning. %$* 757
it looks like it's not going to be until the end of the week before we finally get dennis on out of here and start to bring some better changes, although the ohio valley certainly could use a little bit of rainfall. %$* 757
so in a way not too bad of news for them. %$* 757
one of the bigger problems also is the heat. %$* 757
across the gulf coast, all these folks without power, we're talking middle and upper 80-degree temperatures, and maybe another three to five degrees on top of that with your heat index. %$* 757
we also have a new system to talk about, this is tropical depression number five, this developed late last night, forecast track does have it becoming a tropical storm which would be named emily, before tomorrow arrives. %$* 757
and, candy, we'll get new updates in from the national hurricane center from this tropical depression number five and we'll also get one from the hpc on dennis coming up before the top of the hour. %$* 757
we'll bring it to you then. %$* 757
jacqui jeras, we will back with you, thanks so much. %$* 164
back here in washington, all eyes are on the chief justice and whether he has a retirement letter in the works. %$* 164
up next, senator patrick leahy weighs in on the possibility of two supreme court vacancies and who might fill them. %$* 164
plus, more questions about karl rove and his connection to the leak of a cia agent's name. %$* 164
there is plenty to chew on in our "strategy session." %$* 164
and both those stories are making waves online as we'll find out when we go "inside the blogs." %$* 164
earlier i discussed the current supreme court vacancy and the possibility that there soon might be two openings on the high court with republican senator charles grassley. %$* 164
with me now from capitol hill is senator patrick leahy of vermont. %$* 164
he is the ranking democrat on the judiciary committee. %$* 164
well, of course, the constitution says "advice and consent." %$* 598
it doesn't say nominate and then rubberstamp. %$* 598
the republican, democratic leader, myself and senator specter. %$* 758
i would think, at that time, we will discuss some actual names. %$* 758
i appreciate that kind of consultation. %$* 758
i hope it is real. %$* 758
obviously, he's the one that makes the final decision on who to nominate. %$* 758
but the 100 of us make the decision whether to approve that person or not. %$* 758
i would urge him to have somebody who would unite the country, not divide the country. %$* 758
after all, the supreme court's here for all of us, not for just one political party or another. %$* 758
and we've heard that a lot. %$* 164
and what i'm wondering here:  if you take a conservative judge, when is a conservative judge simply that, and when is a conservative judge divisive? %$* 164
well, when they're divisive because they've taken positions that show that they're almost monolithically in favor of just one group, like just they'll only rule in favor of business, they'll only rule in favor of a certainly class of people, those things. %$* 598
and there are some judges who are like that. %$* 598
they usually end up being reversed. %$* 598
but you don't want them on the supreme court where there's nobody there to reverse them. %$* 598
i worry when they're an activist judge who almost reflexively vote down laws passed by the congress or by the states and create laws of their own, in substitute. %$* 598
the two most activist judges we have right now are justice thomas and justice scalia, who have struck down and thus written laws of their own in place of congressional laws more than anybody else on the current supreme court. %$* 598
well, i know you know that republicans have a different definition of what an activist judge is... %$* 164
well, this is the same definition they've always used for democrats. %$* 598
they said democrats who would strike down a law passed by the people and substitute something of their own -- i'm just using by their own definition -- the two most activist judges there right now are antonin scalia and clarence thomas. %$* 598
and could you support a conservative judge who believes that roe v. wade was not based on constitutional rights? %$* 164
leahy:  well, i don't think you're going to see somebody saying that, because it is such settled law. %$* 164
i can't imagine somebody coming in, for example, and saying, "well, wait. %$* 164
i disagree with brown v. board of education. %$* 164
it's not based on constitutional principles. %$* 164
the warren court overreached itself with that." %$* 164
can you imagine with settled law like brown if somebody wanted to overturn it? %$* 164
it's the same thing with roe v. wade. %$* 164
i don't think you're going to see a justice who is going to be nominated whose intent is to overturn roe v. wade or any other type like brown v. board of education, something else that is so settled. %$* 164
and if there was somebody with that as their avowed purpose, the senate would not approve them. %$* 164
but you know that you can look at the records of judges and see, in fact, when they have ruled sort of one way toward more restrictive abortion rights or less restrictive abortion rights. %$* 164
if you saw a record that pointed you toward someone who sat on the bench who felt that roe v. wade needed to be restricted, could you support that candidate? %$* 164
if i thought somebody wanted to overturn settled law like that, no, i could not. %$* 598
let me ask you also about justice o'connor and this whole chief justice notion that you kicked up. %$* 164
you like that? %$* 598
yes, i love it. %$* 164
is this noise to fill the void in the summer? %$* 164
well, senator specter and i raised that yesterday. %$* 598
the question was, if chief justice rehnquist retired -- and there's no indication that he's going to -- if he were, would justice o'connor respond to a request from the president to take the chief justiceship. %$* 598
now, you got a whole lot of "ifs" in there. %$* 598
given that scenarios, i suspect she would, and i suspect the senate would confirm her. %$* 598
but you're building an if upon if. %$* 598
it's sort of like last friday when all the rumors were going around, a reporter called me at my farm in vermont and i said, "well, what's the latest rumor?" %$* 598
he said, "well, the latest rumor is that 15 of the supreme court justices will resign next week." %$* 598
yes, there are certainly a lot of them to track down, i can tell you that. %$* 164
let me ask you -- one of the things i loved about covering capitol hill so much was that it leaked like a sieve. %$* 164
if you're the president of the united states, do you really want to give a list of supreme court nominees to senators that come to visit your office? %$* 164
so far, i haven't talked to anybody about names i'm going to suggest, nor have the other three senators. %$* 598
we don't intend to. %$* 598
you know, leaks sometimes come at both ends. %$* 598
i worry that if we pass out names, that they might be released by the white house. %$* 598
but i accept the president's offer in good faith. %$* 598
i told him that. %$* 598
and i told him i would be glad to discuss some names with him. %$* 598
and realize, of course, it's his decision in the end, but what i would like is instead of having somebody who wins, say, by 51 votes; that's a divisive candidate, and you're not going to have the country really have confidence in such a person. %$* 598
there are many, many people where you'd find virtually every republican and virtually every democrat would vote for them because they would be uniters, not dividers. %$* 598
that's what i hope the president would do. %$* 598
senator patrick leahy, ranking democrat on the judiciary committee, we hope there are many days ahead where we will be talking to you about this. %$* 164
i suspect i will, candy, and you'll be covering it very well. %$* 598
absolutely. %$* 164
thank you so much. %$* 164
"i sometimes feel that alfred e. neuman is in charge in washington." %$* 759
a republican spokeswoman responds that senator clinton is part of the, quote, "angry and adrift democratic party." %$* 759
naacp chairman julian bond has resumed his criticism of the president. %$* 759
at the group's annual convention in milwaukee, bond said mr. bush likes to quote, "talk the talk, but he doesn't walk the walk when it comes to civil rights." %$* 759
bond has been a persistent critic of the president. %$* 759
he once claimed that republicans draw their strongest support from quote, "the taliban wing of american politics." %$* 759
in presidential politics, indiana democrat evan bayh is in new hampshire today, wrapping up a two-day visit to the granite state. %$* 759
bayh continues to say that while he's not officially running for the white house, he is doing the things he needs to do in case he decides to join the race for 2008. %$* 759
coming up, more on karl rove and the cia leak investigation. %$* 759
we will check in with our blog reporters and i'll talk with newsweek reporter michael isikoff about rove's reported role as a secret source. %$* 759
in the latest ease additions of newsweek, reporter michael isikoff quotes attorneys who say that white house deputy chief of staff karl rove was a source for time magazine reporter matt cooper. %$* 164
cooper, of course, is at the center of the grand jury investigation involving the leak of a cia employee's identity. %$* 164
michael isikoff joins me here in washington. %$* 164
so a couple of things about this story. %$* 164
first, what we do know at this point about rove's relationship to this leak? %$* 164
i should say, we did more than quote attorneys. %$* 760
what we did is we obtained an internal time magazine e-mail that matt cooper wrote to his bureau chief, michael duffy, immediately after talking to karl rove on july 11th, that's before the novak column, in which he says: "double super-secret background, not to be attributed to the white house or rove, but rove gave me a big warning about some of what joe wilson has been saying. %$* 760
he wasn't sent to niger by george tenet or vice president cheney, it was wilson's wife who apparently works at the agency on wmd issues who authorized the trip." %$* 760
that's the quote from matt cooper to his editor right after talking to karl rove. %$* 760
what that tells us is that karl rove did indeed discuss joe wilson, joe wilson's wife, joe wilson's wife's employment with a reporter, matt cooper, prior to the robert novak column. %$* 760
that would seem to conflict with many of the white house public statements at the time, and certainly some of what karl rove's lawyer had been saying publicly up until we got hold of this e-mail. %$* 760
it doesn't answer underlying questions here. %$* 760
for one thing, as many people have pointed out, and we pointed out, karl rove doesn't identify valerie plame by name, so that's an important distinction. %$* 760
and there's nothing in the e-mail that indicates whether or not rove knew that she was a covert operative. %$* 760
in fact, there's nothing in the e-mail that indicates he does. %$* 760
so, therefore, while this is a crucial piece of evidence and clearly advances the ball about what we know about this incident, it doesn't resolve the underlying questions of whether somebody deliberately leaked the name of valerie plame, knowing that she was a covert operative, in order to retaliate against wilson. %$* 760
that's the crime that fitzgerald has been investigating, and we still don't know whether he's got enough evidence to bring charges against rove or anybody else. %$* 760
and there are -- and the setting in which this took place is that joe wilson had written this column, and it said, listen, these things that the administration say that were in niger were not there, i went over there, i was sent by the cia. %$* 164
and the white house was trying to push back. %$* 164
this was a damaging column because this was one of their key reasons for going to war in iraq. %$* 164
right. %$* 760
this was some of the first early criticisms of the intelligence that brought us to iraq from somebody who had something to do with the process, even if it was a bit marginal, but somebody from the inside who was saying the intelligence that the white house used to take us to war was seriously flawed. %$* 760
right. %$* 164
so what we are seeing here it looks like is some pushback from the white house, going, well, wait a minute, first of all, it's not right that the cia send him. %$* 164
his wife sent him over there. %$* 164
so it could be something... %$* 164
but the problem that people in the white house, rove among them, may have is how did they know that valerie plame, or wilson's wife worked at the cia? %$* 760
what we do know is there was a classified state department report that said this, that was taken by secretary of state powell with him on the trip to africa that president bush was then on, and many senior white house aides were on. %$* 760
that classified state department report appears to have been -- or may well have been the source for the information that rove and others were then dishing out to reporters. %$* 760
and if that's the case, there still may be -- we don't know yet, but there still may be an instance where classified information was provided to reporters. %$* 760
there's -- we have got less than a minute left, but i want to ask you about the political versus the legal. %$* 164
the legal we're going to have to let the special prosecutor work out. %$* 164
but politically, there already seems to be -- the dynamic is already in place that we see, that this is somewhat of a snowball. %$* 164
we mentioned that there was sort of a contentious white house briefing. %$* 164
politically, how badly do you think this story... %$* 164
hard to say. %$* 760
i think the problem that the white house has is the public statements that they made at the time in which they completely dismissed the notion that rove or anybody else in the white house had anything to do with the outing of valerie plame, totally ridiculous i think was scott mcclellan's line that he gave to reporters. %$* 760
now, since, mcclellan is refusing to answer any questions, saying we can't talk about it, it's an ongoing criminal investigation. %$* 760
the problem is they already had talked about it, and the question that is being asked is, are those previous statements still operative? %$* 760
michael isikoff, reporter extraordinaire from newsweek, thanks so much for joining us. %$* 164
thank you. %$* 760
karl rove's reported role in cia leak controversy is making waves in the blogosphere. %$* 164
for more we want to check in with cnn political producer abbi tatton and jacki schechner, our blog reporter -- jacki. %$* 164
jacki schechner, cnn blog reporter:  hey, candy. %$* 164
maybe it's because so much stuff is double super secret, but it's all very confusing and the blogs are trying to figure it all out. %$* 164
we go over to mark ar kleiman, he is a professor of public policy at ucla. %$* 164
and he calls this "clear as mud," saying it's actually not bad reporting that's making this confusing, he says, it's a set of pieces that don't yet form a coherent pattern, and they're all trying to sift through all of the little bits of pieces of information that are coming out. %$* 164
in the last couple of hours, the emphasis has turned in the progressive blogs to the press briefing this morning from the white house, scott mcclellan's press briefing. %$* 384
the site thinkprogress.org, which is the blogging arm of the center for american progress, had been pushing the white house press corps for a week now to ask questions on the rove story, calling it "day 6" of the "white house press corps silent on rove" on friday. %$* 384
today, success, mcclellan really pushed on this issue again and again. %$* 384
in a press briefing that this site called "stunning," and they actually broke it down, his evasive maneuvers, they said. %$* 384
twenty- three was the number of times mcclellan couldn't answer a question because the rove investigation is ongoing. %$* 384
no surprise that the left is all over this one, calling for karl rove's resignation. %$* 325
there's a couple of sites that are hammering that in, the carpetbagger report being one of them, digby's blog being another, americablog. %$* 325
but over to hullabaloo, this is digbysblog.blogspot.com, saying legal implications aside, that karl rove is a high-level white house official, and there is no reason that he should be talking about a cia operative in any political context at all. %$* 325
he should resign. %$* 325
and at the very least, a lot of the left side of the blogs saying that he should have his security clearance pulled at this point. %$* 325
on the right, a lot of people focusing on the legal aspect of this. %$* 384
did karl rove break any law? %$* 384
breaking it down at powerlineblog.com, this is three attorneys, all conservative, all looking at this piece by piece, really, and the act involved, saying, it's hard to see how rove could be indicted for violation of the intelligence identities protection act. %$* 384
that also over at captain's quarters blog, saying a similar thing: "i believe rove is completely off the legal hook. %$* 384
but what about the moral question as opposed to the legal?" %$* 384
so one eye here on rove today. %$* 384
and the other eye on rehnquist, which makes you kind of, i guess, cross-eyed. %$* 325
so they're talking about will justice rehnquist retire? %$* 325
obviously that was a big conversation on friday, will he, won't he? %$* 325
it was swirling around wonkette.com. %$* 325
she's a d.c. gossip blog. %$* 325
she has the update, he still has not retired. %$* 325
going on to say that everybody in the blogs seems to have a source, none of them particularly reliable at this point. %$* 325
red state, the conservative group blog was also looking at this all day friday. %$* 384
they were talking about their, "friend of mine close to the white house who tells me," and we saw a lot of that all day friday. %$* 384
they're still looking. %$* 384
one blogger says, "you don't need to worry today, it's not going to happen." %$* 384
this is bench memos, which is attached to the conservative national review, where they have k-lo indicator. %$* 384
"he's not going to retire today, why, because we have figured out his signaling. %$* 384
he's wearing his nike cap, nike signifying he's in good shape and will keep running." %$* 384
and we're all looking for an indicator at this point, and any predictor is good as another. %$* 325
over at this blog, underneath their robes -- this is a -- we like to say this is like "people" magazine is to celebrities. %$* 325
this is what this blog to the federal judiciary. %$* 325
they like to take a look at everything, from what they're driving to what they're wearing. %$* 325
and they say that hiring of clerks is a good indicator. %$* 325
we'll send it back to you -- candy. %$* 325
jacki schechner, abbi tatton, thanks so much. %$* 164
coming up, the "strategy session" on inside politics. %$* 164
president bush stands by the british in the wake of last week's attacks and says there's only one course of action in the face of terror. %$* 164
we'll have details ahead. %$* 164
crowley;  it is time to get some different perspectives on major issues in today's "strategy session." %$* 164
here today, jack valenti, former aide to president lyndon johnson and bay buchanan, president of american cause. %$* 164
today, a presidential progress report on the war on terror. %$* 164
bus adviser karl rove, the reporter for "time" magazine and uncovering a cia operative. %$* 164
and the not-so comic comparison hillary clinton used to describe president bush. %$* 164
president bush, of course, spoke to about 1,000 people at the fbi training academy at quantico today. %$* 164
coming days after the bombings in london, the previously-scheduled address was to provide an update on the war on terror. %$* 164
the president said the only course of action is to take the fight to an enemy that can't be negotiated with. %$* 164
these kind of people who blew up subways and buses are not people you can negotiate with or reason with or appease. %$* 161
in the face of such adversaries, there is only one course of action. %$* 161
we will continue to take the fight to the enemy and we will fight until this enemy is defeated. %$* 161
i want to start out with that very argument, then, is that there's only one course of action -- we've heard this before from the president -- is to take this fight to the enemy. %$* 164
we're fighting in iraq so we don't have to fight them here at home. %$* 164
i want to show you a new poll where we asked americans, did the war with iraq make the u.s. safer for terrorism? %$* 164
and what we see is that those who believe it is less safe have jumped up by 15 percent -- 15 points, sorry -- higher now since the bombings, that america is less safe. %$* 164
so i'm not sure this argument seems to be taking hold at all with the american people. %$* 164
do you buy it? %$* 164
well, i don't. %$* 327
i think the president is doing what presidents have to do -- talk to the people,and give the people their best judgment about what the course of action ought to be. %$* 327
and i have no quarrel with that course of action, except that what contradicts him is daily television and news headlines. %$* 327
and, of course, the bombing in london as well. %$* 327
i think most americans believe that sooner or later we're going to be hit, and that what iraq has become has been a breeding ground for terrorists who are coming from all over the world to learn the instruction in how to be a terrorist. %$* 327
so i think most americans share the belief that, no, we're not safer at all because of this war. %$* 327
you know, jack has a point, candy, that what is important for the president is that the american people keep that connection with iraq and terrorism, because that's when they support the war in the iraq. %$* 422
and when that's being broken down -- and i do believe over the last couple of months, it has started to separate there -- then they start losing support for iraq. %$* 422
and he cannot continue that war month after month after month without the support of the american people. %$* 422
i think today the american people want to say, listen, let's do the best we can in iraq, turn it over to the iraqi people, and let's start getting out, because we are concerned about security here at home. %$* 422
and that is where the president has a problem. %$* 422
we have a very porous border, and the americans know that those terrorists can come right across this border anytime they want, and he has not addressed that. %$* 422
let me play another portion of the president's speech, because it goes directly to this point of are we any safer. %$* 164
and he talked a little bit about what we have and have not stopped since 9/11. %$* 164
since september the 11th, our coalition has disrupted a number of al qaeda terrorist plots, arrested al qaeda operatives here to chase specific u.s. targets and caught others trying to sneak into our country. %$* 161
isn't that a little bit of the problem, is that you only see the failures? %$* 164
and you never see the successes. %$* 164
i'm assuming that this is correct, that we have been able to stop things. %$* 164
i've talked to a number of former fbi agents, friends of mine, who have close contacts with the agent -- bureau. %$* 327
and they say that, that we have stopped a lot of plots that could have killed people, at least for many. %$* 327
and -- but the trouble is that you can't make that public without disclosing the techniques that you use or you don't want to do that. %$* 327
and you might disrupt some other investigations that are going on now. %$* 327
i think we've got to put a lot of faith into the fbi and cia and the other intelligence agencies that are trying to protect us. %$* 327
without information, we'll never survive. %$* 327
but you know, and the president benefits, candy. %$* 422
because while we may not know all of the times that we have captured or prevented some terrorist attack, we do know we have not been attacked since 9/11, and then the president gets that credit. %$* 422
we have not been attacked. %$* 422
but i think as i've traveled just this last couple months into the states, there's more and more questions among republicans, is why does he not have the will to defend our borders? %$* 422
and as we know just in the last couple weeks, some of these al qaeda were trying to get across that border. %$* 422
so that is where i think he's going to have trouble. %$* 422
it's the number one issue on the minds of americans in many, many states. %$* 422
we're going to move along, because there's a new report saying someone inside the white house did talk to a journalist about an undercover cia operative. %$* 164
what did one of president bush's closest advisers tell the reporter? %$* 164
that issue, when the "strategy session" returns. %$* 164
welcome back to inside politics. %$* 164
for two years, white house officials and presidential adviser karl rove have said that rove had nothing to do with leaking the identity of cia operative valerie plame. %$* 164
that is what rove told cnn during the republican convention in new york, last year. %$* 164
i didn't know her name. %$* 312
i didn't leak her name. %$* 312
as we reported earlier, in the latest edition of "newsweek," there's a report that rove did talk to "time" magazine's matt cooper about valerie plame before her identify was revealed in a column written by cnn contributor robert novak. %$* 164
"newsweek" quoted an e-mail cooper wrote to his bureau chief on the conversation. %$* 164
they were discussing former ambassador joseph wilson's trip to africa to investigate claims iraq was trying to buy uranium. %$* 164
this from the e-mail:  "it was, kr said, wilson's wife, who apparently works at the agency on wmd issues who authorized the trip. %$* 164
rove's attorney confirmed that rove and cooper spoke, but the lawyer says rove did not use plame's name in that conversation. %$* 164
politically, you know, candy, it was alarming to me to find out, indeed, that he was involved to the extent that he was. %$* 761
and when you look back at the timing in this earlier statement, it's clintonian. %$* 761
he was doing -- what he was doing, he was keeping himself out of becoming a campaign issue. %$* 761
he was very successful and it moved out, but from what you read, what actually happened, i still do not think he's the focus of an investigation. %$* 761
that's what we're told. %$* 761
i believe that. %$* 761
and i don't believe he broke any laws. %$* 761
as i have read in the papers what the law is, it's you have to deliberately know that this woman was a covert agent. %$* 762
if she wasn't a covert agent, there's no law broken on this and i think the lawyers will have a fine field day here. %$* 762
i think this is a little setback for mr. rove for a few weeks, but it will pass away. %$* 762
the fact is, that all administrations leak. %$* 762
this is not something, you know, that i'm shocked this is going on upstairs. %$* 762
it happens. %$* 762
my judgment is that there's no long-term damage here, because i'm not even sure what's the big deal with this wilson and his wife valley plame thing. %$* 762
it's not what i would call a huge issue facing the american public today. %$* 762
well, probably from your lips to bay's ears. %$* 164
i mean, just --  we have senator lautenberg, who has called -- asked that karl rove's security clearance be taken away from him. %$* 164
moveon.org, which is sort of the leading edge of the left, going, you know:  throw him out, he needs to resign. %$* 164
i mean... %$* 164
well that's all -- that's politics. %$* 762
politics ain't bean bag and i think bay knows, it's a pretty -- it's a blood sport and this is what's going on right now. %$* 762
and you know, there's no question the press is going to be all over him for many days, because they feel he betrayed them. %$* 422
he said something. %$* 422
he misled them. %$* 422
they bought it. %$* 422
they didn't pursue it. %$* 422
it's under -- it is an investigation, a federal investigation and so, it is very serious. %$* 763
and if he does become the focus of that, then it's extraordinarily serious. %$* 763
but i, you know -- from what i read, i don't know how he violated any laws, from what i read. %$* 763
but again, are we reading what really happened or are reading the spin? %$* 763
i don't know. %$* 763
ok. %$* 164
senator hilly clinton threw some red meat to people who think she'd make a good presidential candidate in 2008. %$* 164
when we return, the mad comparison clinton made when describing the job president bush is doing in washington. %$* 164
i'm wolf blitzer reporting from the cnn center in atlanta. %$* 142
coming up at the top of the hour, the gulf coast cleans up after hurricane dennis. %$* 142
we'll have a live report from florida. %$* 142
new reaction from president bush and prime minister tony blair. %$* 764
bob woodward and carl bernstein. %$* 765
they're standing by live. %$* 765
all those stories, much more, only minutes away on "wolf blitzer reports." %$* 765
now back to inside politics. %$* 765
the "strategy session" continues. %$* 164
jack balenti and bay buchanan are here today. %$* 164
the new york senator and potential presidential candidate for some has spent time with well-known conservatives lately including newt gingrich and senate majority leader bill frist, but yesterday she served up bush- bashing red meat for blue-staters, hitting the president on the economy and the war in iraq. %$* 766
mrs. clinton said, " i sometimes feel that alfred e. neuman is in charge in washington." %$* 766
clinton says the president's attitude on tough issues reminds her of the "mad" magazine character's catch phrase "what, me worry?" %$* 766
so, over the top? %$* 766
politics ain't being bad, right? %$* 766
i think it's a funny line, and she doubtless got marvelous applause from the audience. %$* 327
but having worked for a president in the white house myself, i'm very reluctant to go after a president, because i know better than most the agony and the problems and the life-and-death decisions that they're called upon to make. %$* 327
so i really stand back from something like that. %$* 327
i don't feel good about it. %$* 327
and i know what president clinton went through, the decisions he had to make. %$* 327
you can disagree with him, and a lot of people did, as a lot of people disagreed with president johnson or with president reagan or whatever, but i'm reluctant to go after somebody like that in a comic, personal way. %$* 327
and you know, it was just about as dumb politics as i can imagine. %$* 422
i mean, she is a national figure. %$* 422
she's attacking the president on policy, which is exactly what she should be doing in order to start building and energizing the democrats. %$* 422
but to call the commander-in-chief, especially in a time of war, and especially right after this terrible tragedy in london, to call him names is so foolhardy. %$* 422
she antagonizes so many people that might start being sympathetic to her message, and i believe she's hurt herself with it. %$* 422
well, i must say, senator clinton is a keenly intelligent woman, and she understands how to transform herself, which she's doing right now, and she's doing it, i think, in a very, very subtle and discursive way. %$* 327
but i think every now and then, even the best of us will say something foolish. %$* 327
but don't you think she said it on purpose? %$* 164
i mean, is there a good hillary and bad hillary. %$* 164
or is there a centrist hillary and then the one that needs to keep the left half with sort of the red meat -- %$* 164
absolutely. %$* 422
what she has to worry about, she's trying to move to the center. %$* 422
she's very scripted, so you're absolutely right, this was deliberate. %$* 422
but she at the same time doesn't want to have somebody coming in on her left flank. %$* 422
and so she wants to keep them happy as she starts to move towards the middle. %$* 422
and i think that's exactly what she's trying to do. %$* 422
but doing it with a silly calling names, to reduce herself to that is a mistake. %$* 422
just attack him on the issues. %$* 422
but also, look at the words she uses. %$* 422
instead of saying, look it, where are the jobs in this country? %$* 422
we've lost jobs in this country, she says there's a loss of manufacturing diversity. %$* 422
now, that's a wonk. %$* 422
she won't go anywhere if she wants to be a wonk. %$* 422
she should just get down, find the issues and become a populist that is attractive to the middle. %$* 422
well, don't underestimate this woman. %$* 327
she's terrific. %$* 327
she's going to be a formidable candidate, without any question, and anybody that wants to take her on in the democratic primaries has got a heavy hill to climb. %$* 327
but this is 2005. %$* 327
the election is in 2008. %$* 327
we've got a long journey. %$* 327
but you know we can't help ourselves here though. %$* 164
you know, but don't you wonder sometimes whether we've completely moved away from that sort of more gentile era, if there ever was one in politics, that you're talking about, because, you know, we have the senate democratic leader, who has, you know, called bush a liar and loser. %$* 164
and, i mean, you know, alfred e. newman, i mean, is that such a big deal? %$* 164
well, i think that president johnson used to say that, when  you get into a political fight, always leave your adversary a little exit-way so he retains his dignity, because your adversary today may have to be your ally tomorrow. %$* 327
i don't think you win votes by going after somebody personally. %$* 327
i think you go after them by disagreeing heartily and passionately with the issues, and saying i respect the president, but i think he's dead wrong on this. %$* 327
and then go into some particular as to why what you have said has clout and reason to it. %$* 327
and one objective... %$* 422
and don't you have to worry about name recognition alfred e. neuman anyway? %$* 164
yes, it's only -- those who are younger than us probably are still trying to figure out who the heck that character is. %$* 422
i hate to tell you that. %$* 422
but it really does demean her. %$* 422
it was a mistake for her politically. %$* 422
the president is the commander-in- chief. %$* 422
we are at war. %$* 422
and americans expect one another to respect the office of the presidency. %$* 422
and by suggesting that he is some kind of cartoon character was a mistake. %$* 422
bay buchanan, jack valenti, always fun. %$* 164
thanks so much. %$* 164
thank you. %$* 327
good to be with you. %$* 422
bloggers weigh in on the london terror attacks. %$* 422
up next, we rejoin abbi and jacki for a look at what people are saying in the blogosphere. %$* 422
people around the world are using blogs to share their thoughts about the london terror bombings. %$* 164
we want to check in once again with cnn political producer abbi tatton and jacki schechner, our blog reporter. %$* 164
jacki. %$* 164
well, candy, last week, we talked  about the tremendous role that the blogs played during the bombings in london, how when mobile communication lines went down -- not lines, but means went down, rather, people went on-line to tell people they were all right and to communicate with each other. %$* 325
they were also sharing their thoughts and giving firsthand accounts. %$* 325
they are still doing that now. %$* 325
not only technorati , truth laid bear, aggragators , like that with tremendous amounts of posts -- there's well over 3,200 just on truth laid bear alone -- but also sites like media culpa, which is talking about all of the mainstream media organizations who are talking about the importance of the blogs. %$* 325
very circular. %$* 325
now a few days on, some people are using the internet to share their sympathies with people in london. %$* 384
a lot has been written about, we'renotafraid.com, a site set up by a south african where people are sharing their images to show that they stand in solidarity with the people in london, that they are not afraid. %$* 384
lots of photo shopping going on here. %$* 384
also lots of linking by u.s. bloggers, showing their support as well for london. %$* 384
this is jeff jarvis  at buzzmachine.com posting his favorite picture and also his contribution to the site. %$* 384
there are also message boards where people are discussing their sympathy for london. %$* 384
and if you check in with some of the london bloggers, you'll find that the message is, this sympathy from overseas is very nice, but we're moving on. %$* 384
this is thelondonist.com , a site that was really helping out fellow londoners on thursday with web updates and travel updates, hotlines, that kind of thing. %$* 384
mike aseton  writing there says today that, "thanks for the sympathy, but really, we're fine. %$* 384
we're moving on. %$* 384
we've been through this before." %$* 384
highlighting the omagh bombing back in '98 and the ira bomb in '96, saying that, "you'll hear a lot about the stiff upper lip, but if you go to london right now, they'll probably just shrug and as you to buy a round." %$* 384
so moving on there. %$* 384
and finally, we wanted to check back in with justin , the blogger at edge railroad, who was on the train who was bombed there and posted about his account. %$* 325
his site was flooded with people who were interested in hearing what he had to say. %$* 325
he's now trying to reconcile that with how to get people back to what he normally blogs about and how to reconcile those two and turn his blog back in a normal direction for him. %$* 325
candy, we'll send it back to you. %$* 325
always tough turn the corner. %$* 164
jacki schechner, abbi tatton, thanks so much. %$* 164
and that is it for inside politics. %$* 164
i'm candy crowley. %$* 164
and "wolf blitzer reports" starts right now. %$* 164
aftermath of hurricane dennis. %$* 142
and we're tracking another storm in the atlantic now called tropical depression number 5. %$* 142
but it soon could be named emily. %$* 142
stand by for hard news on wolf blitzer report. %$* 142

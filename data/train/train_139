republicans strike back against democrats making demands on john roberts. %$* 116
our friends on the other side of the aisle are going to do everything they can to obstruct the confirmation process of the president's nominee to the supreme court. %$* 193
will there be a fierce partisan fight after all? %$* 116
trading allegations. %$* 116
the republican majority, once again, turned the floor of the house into a set for "let's make a deal." %$* 201
the house gives president bush the trade pact he wanted, but were ethical lines crossed to make that happen? %$* 116
soaring hopes and now dashed dreams. %$* 116
the grounding of the space shuttle fleet leaves the space program in limbo. %$* 116
everything is back almost to square zero. %$* 21
and is he in, or out? %$* 116
we'll ask senator rick santorum to clarify his presidential intentions, and talk about his literary showdown with hillary clinton. %$* 116
now, live from washington, cnn's inside politics. %$* 116
thanks for joining us. %$* 308
i'm ed henry. %$* 308
in the week and a half since president bush nominated john roberts, democrats have been going after the supreme court nominee a little more each day. %$* 308
it may not a full frontal attack, but some republicans seem to have had enough, so they're taking new steps to keep roberts' nomination on track, using a good cop/bad cop strategy. %$* 308
... senators for dinner at this washington steakhouse, to help cool growing tension over the supreme court battle. %$* 311
i'm optimistic. %$* 964
we've been having good meetings and, you know, hopefully all the things will be resolved. %$* 964
fred thompson dined with key members of the so-called gang of 14 moderates, who earlier helped avert a nuclear crisis over lower court judges. %$* 308
senators say the meeting with thompson will help diffuse sudden skirmishes over the timing of confirmation meetings and how many documents the white house needs to produce. %$* 308
i think it's just kind of ground noise that happens, and nobody ever thought it was going to be a complete smooth trip. %$* 368
so i think it's going to be all right. %$* 368
but republican leaders do not seem so optimistic. %$* 308
our friends on the other side of the aisle are going to do everything they can to obstruct the confirmation process of the president's nominee to the supreme court. %$* 193
at issue, the fact that the white house has turned over thousands of pages of documents from roberts' time as a young lawyer in the reagan administration, but is refusing to release documents from the first bush administration. %$* 308
now, i know that the white house press secretary much prefers talking about karl rove, but i would suggest to him that that is probably an unrealistic standard to set that i can only read things that the president has read, because i doubt very much the president, whom i respect greatly, has read judge roberts' opinions. %$* 598
republicans insist the papers are covered by the attorney/client privilege. %$* 308
we should stop this game of "gotcha" and move to the goal post that it appears that we have already begun. %$* 365
the white house, meanwhile, is trying to steer clear of a partisan fight over whether the hearings should start in august or septmeber. %$* 308
oh that's -- i'll leave that for others to work out. %$* 964
we will show up whenever it's scheduled. %$* 964
and democrats are not showing any sign of backing off from their demands or from asking tough questions. %$* 308
the senate judiciary committee sent a 10-page questionnaire to judge roberts yesterday. %$* 308
it could lead to new information about his role in the florida presidential recount battle of 2000. %$* 308
and seven democratic women in the senate are launching a new web site to solicit questions to ask roberts during his confirmation hearings. %$* 308
at that news conference, senator hillary clinton was asked if she would vote against roberts if he testified that roe v. wade is not settled law. %$* 308
she sidestepped that question, saying, quote, "i want to wait and see how he answers." %$* 308
another flash-point on the hill today, the house democratic leaders accusing republicans of using questionable tactics to get a controversial trade deal passed. %$* 308
the central american free trade agreement, known as cafta, cleared the house by a two-vote margin last night. %$* 308
it would eliminate trade barriers between the u.s. and guatemala, el salvador, honduras, nicaragua, costa rica and the dominican republic. %$* 308
the vote dragged on for an hour amid last-minute negotiating and arm-twisting by gop leaders, and after president bush and vice president cheney personally lobbied lawmakers. %$* 308
house minority leader nancy pelosi urged reporters to ask republicans how far they went to secure a cafta victory. %$* 308
i do know of reports that have been made to me about offers that were made to democrats and they came running in saying it didn't sound like it passed the legal muster to me. %$* 201
but they know what they've done and they know it's at additional cost to the u.s. taxpayer. %$* 201
you should ask them. %$* 201
i'll talk with minority leader pelosi a bit later on inside politics. %$* 308
right now, let's find out what the white house is saying about cafta, now headed to the president's desk since the senate approved the pact last month. %$* 308
here's our white house correspondent suzanne malveaux -- suzanne. %$* 308
well, ed, of course the white house is very happy about this. %$* 307
this is a big victory for the president. %$* 307
he intentionally kept his schedule open so he could do some serious lobbying. %$* 307
as you mentioned before, of course, it was really quite a scene on capitol hill over the last 12 to 24 hours. %$* 307
president bush making a rare appearance. %$* 307
also, of course, vice president dick cheney, as well as the secretaries of commerce, agriculture, u.s. trade representative. %$* 307
all of them there to try to push forward those republicans to pass cafta. %$* 307
as you had mentioned before, some call it some arm-twisting and some deal-making here, but the focal point was earlier this week. %$* 307
that is when the president went behind closed doors before the republican conference and essentially said to them, this is not just a matter of opening up these markets, it's also matter of national security and rewarding those allies in the war on terror. %$* 307
it helps to strengthen democracy in our own hemisphere. %$* 314
this goes right to our own national security. %$* 314
this is an agreement that will help extend peace and prosperity throughout the western hemisphere. %$* 314
while we are working to advance freedom abroad, we also need to be looking in our own hemisphere and make sure that we're supporting the democratic efforts that continue to advance in our own hemisphere. %$* 314
now, ed, as you know, of course, this was a particularly tough fight for the president for a couple of reasons. %$* 307
it did not fall strictly along party lines. %$* 307
there were rather regional pockets of republicans who represented, essentially, the sugar, the textile industries. %$* 307
their constituents were quite concerned about the cost to u.s. jobs. %$* 307
those were the ones that they were after to convince. %$* 307
first it was north carolina that folded, went from no to yes, then you had ohio as well as pennsylvania decided to get on board. %$* 307
the other aspect of this, as well, is that the democrats were very united in their stance. %$* 307
this was a labor issue, but it was also a party loyalty issue. %$* 307
the white house only able to pick off about 15 democrats for the cafta -- for that passage. %$* 307
ultimately, it worked out for the president in the end. %$* 307
this is a white house that is quite pleased. %$* 307
they are also looking at the energy bill, the highway bill as other potential victories. %$* 307
and this, of course, ironically in light -- when you look at the bigger picture -- their centerpiece for the domestic agenda, social security, has failed to gain much traction -- ed. %$* 307
ok, suzanne malveaux from the white house. %$* 308
thank you. %$* 308
while the bush administration touts that victory as a boon for national security and stability, the american people increasingly have their doubts about trade benefits. %$* 308
48 percent of those surveyed for our new poll say they see foreign trade as a threat to the united states. %$* 308
that's up from 41 percent in 2003, and 35 percent in 2000. %$* 308
i spoke earlier today, in fact, with u.s. trade representative rob portman about resistance to cafta, and the horse trading that got it passed. %$* 308
i began by asking the former gop congressman just how wild the scene was on capitol hill last night. %$* 308
well, it wasn't too wild in the sense that we knew where most members of congress were going to end up, but there was a small group of undecided members. %$* 965
and the way we persuaded them to support this agreement was the agreement itself. %$* 965
it's a fundamentally sound agreement because it opens up the markets in central america, just as they already have to access to markets. %$* 965
so it was a fair-trade agreement. %$* 965
it was our ability to say to members of congress that this ought to not just be free trade, but fair trade... %$* 965
but if it was fair trade... %$* 308
... and end up being beneficial. %$* 965
but if it was fair trade, i wonder why so many republicans had a hard time supporting it and took so long to actually get it through. %$* 308
there was a lobbyist against cafta who told "the wall street journal" today, quote, "if they voted their conscience, cafta would fail by 50 votes." %$* 308
isn't it true you really had to barter and offer up roads and bridges and other pork projects to get this through? %$* 308
no, i feel just the opposite about it. %$* 965
as you said, i was in congress for 12 years. %$* 965
i was in the leadership, i was a member of the whip team, i had been through a lot of these votes, including trade promotion authority. %$* 965
and the truth is, if members had voted their conscience, we would have won by 50 votes. %$* 965
because members, when they looked at this agreement, realized it was a good agreement, good agreement for our country, but also good agreement for central america to ensure our national security in that important part of the world. %$* 965
the fact is, the politics is what made it difficult on this vote. %$* 965
but... %$* 308
and the fact is that those who oppose trade threw everything but the kitchen sink at this agreement, ed. %$* 965
and you know that when we first got started on this exercise, we were way behind because labor unions and others who oppose trade this is the one, we're going to draw the line here. %$* 965
we're going to stop this agreement. %$* 965
the other agreements with countries like australia, jordan, morocco, and so on, did not have that same controversy. %$* 965
the controversy was brought on by those who oppose trade, and made this a political vote. %$* 965
so, courageous members stood up and voted their conscience and did the right thing for america. %$* 965
but mr. %$* 308
ambassador, if the economic benefits of this were so good, why did you not sell it as an economic package? %$* 308
instead, we had the president, vice president and the secretary of state among others on the hill this week, saying it was a national security issue not a trade issue. %$* 308
and they were saying it was about stabilizing democracies in central america. %$* 308
some lawmakers in both are saying what does that have to do with trade? %$* 308
you should be worrying about the economy in the united states. %$* 308
well, i can tell you as the quarterback, i guess, of the effort -- i talked about the economic benefits constantly, as did the president. %$* 965
the reality is that although it's 44 million consumers, and our second biggest market in latin america, the trade benefits of this agreement are not as large as trade benefits for bigger agreements. %$* 965
for instance even the mexican agreement that we did back in the 90s, or even the world trade organization agreement. %$* 965
but the benefits were clear. %$* 965
the fact is that because the politics were so tough, because the other side, again, tried everything they could to derail this, that it was not just about trade but also it was about national security. %$* 965
but you had the president make a rare visit to the hill and personally lobby on this. %$* 965
and he still got only a republican-lead house to pass it by only two volts, doesn't that confirm that he is, in fact, a lame duck. %$* 965
and he's having a hard time getting his own republicans on board with his agenda? %$* 965
absolutely not. %$* 965
this agreement, was again, a huge uphill battle. %$* 965
it was way behind, because those who opposed trade, again, did everything they could and focused on this agreement trying, frankly with regard to these central american democracies, these fragile democracies, the poor folks in central america who would like to increase their standard of living and modernize their economy, putting a lot of pressure on them to be able to solve these bigger problems that had nothing to do with this agreement. %$* 965
and so the president had an uphill battle. %$* 965
and he did a good job. %$* 965
and by the way when he came to the hill, i was there, he did talk about the central america free trade agreement. %$* 965
but for about 10 percent of will time, he also talked about all the other agenda items that we had accomplished. %$* 965
and what was coming up, including the energy bill and the highway bill and so on. %$* 965
and it was great that he came to the hill. %$* 965
he doesn't do it often. %$* 965
but he tends to do it toward the end of a session like this or when we are going into a break. %$* 965
so it was a helpful rallying cry. %$* 965
but it wasn't just on the central american free trade agreement. %$* 965
that was rob portman, the u.s. trade representative talking about last night's victory on the central american free trade agreement. %$* 965
we now want to turn to texas and update you on a story breaking this afternoon, an explosion has torn through a chemical plant on the north side of ft. worth. %$* 965
there are an undetermined number of injuries. %$* 965
we've heard at least four injured. %$* 965
you can see the black smoke, which can be seen for miles throughout ft. worth. %$* 965
we want to bring in now eric lamar. %$* 965
he is the director of hazmat training for the international association of firefighters here in washington. %$* 965
mr. lamar, are you there? %$* 965
i am, ed, how are you? %$* 966
good, how are you. %$* 308
thank you for joining us. %$* 308
i understand you have been watching by television. %$* 308
can you give us an idea of what your immediate reaction is from watching that of how bad of a blaze this is? %$* 308
well, clearly it's a catastrophic event. %$* 966
they appear to have the vast majority of the structure involved in a huge fire. %$* 966
it sounds like from what i learned earlier, it is a -- it's a concern of where they have bulk storage of a wide variety of chemicals. %$* 966
so they have a serious hazardous materials incident on their hands. %$* 966
so now, since this is obviously not a normal fire, how do the firefighters approach it? %$* 308
give us an idea of how you attack a fire like this. %$* 308
lamar:  well, from what i can see, they are certainly taking what we would refer to as a defensive posture. %$* 308
so, essentially, they have made the decision that there's no way to conduct an offensive interior attack in the building. %$* 308
so from the video, you can definitely see that they have set up large streams some distance from the building. %$* 308
and they are going to try to control the fire to the extent that they can, using these large streams while they obviously keep the public away. %$* 308
and also they are keeping firefighting forces, hopefully, a safe distance away from the building, although you can see that they are continuing to have some really serious explosions. %$* 308
so you want to stay back as far as you can, acknowledging that all they are able to do at this point is really to try to protect exposures around the building that's involved, because, of course, that building is a total loss at this point. %$* 308
now, you can see those dramatic pictures. %$* 308
it appears that the wind was really blowing this fire with more force. %$* 308
and right past those power lines. %$* 308
is that another concern, given those power lines right there around the fire that we saw a moment ago. %$* 308
how do you approach that? %$* 308
well, obviously power lines are a concern. %$* 966
but i think, you know, you are looking at the immediate fire area at this point. %$* 966
a serious issue. %$* 966
it's going to try to be, can you confine the fire and protect the exposures that are closest to the building. %$* 966
and then you also obviously have other issues in an incident like this. %$* 966
for instance, they have to be concerned about the smoke plume downwind. %$* 966
what's contained in that plume? %$* 966
do they have to worry about downwind evacuation? %$* 966
how far downwind is appropriate? %$* 966
and of course, from the explosions that we're seeing, from those explosions, is there a significant debris problem? %$* 966
what's the danger area there? %$* 966
so, of course, their primary interest at the incident is going to be life safety definitely at that property, but also figuring out in the immediate area, what's the life safety problem? %$* 966
who has to be evacuated? %$* 966
and then as i mentioned a minute ago, because it is a hazmat incident and they have this downwind smoke problem, how do you effectively and quickly evacuate those folks so they are not being exposed to toxic products involved in the fire? %$* 966
ok. %$* 308
thank you very much. %$* 308
eric lamar a hazmat expert at the international association of firefighters. %$* 308
thank you for joining us. %$* 308
as you can see, the fire is still raging. %$* 308
we will be checking back in in ft worth throughout the afternoon and evening as news warrants. %$* 308
now back to inside politics. %$* 308
democratic house leader nancy pelosi today had some tough comments about republican efforts to secure last night's victory on the central american free trade agreement. %$* 308
pelosi even questioned whether some questionable deals might have been made by republicans in getting votes. %$* 308
i spoke with nancy pelosi a short while ago and asked her about those allegations. %$* 308
what i said was that the republicans turned the floor of the house of representatives into a "let's make a deal" set. %$* 201
it was reminiscent of what happened at the time of the medicare prescription drug legislation that evening. %$* 201
and again this time they kept the vote open a long time. %$* 201
but many of the overtures that were made to members was made before even going to the floor. %$* 201
so this is about, again, an abuse of power, in an unethical way of passing legislations. %$* 201
and depending on what members decide to do, may require further attention. %$* 201
but now, it seems to me, you have a responsibility as a leader in congress if, in fact you believe there was some corruption, whether it was rules broken or laws broken to come forward and explain and get specific. %$* 308
well, what i will say to you very clearly is that i do think there is a culture of corruption in the capitol of the united states. %$* 201
that they have turned the gavel of the speaker into an auctioneers gavel. %$* 201
and that's what i am talking about. %$* 201
and that would have been a abuse of power in that regard. %$* 201
and i have said that over and over, again. %$* 201
and last night was a further manifestation of it. %$* 201
but madam leader, we also heard that union leaders were going around saying that any democrat supporting this central american free trade agreement would not get political support, not get political money down the line. %$* 308
what's the difference there? %$* 308
it seems like democrats are also bean muscled. %$* 308
there's plenty of difference. %$* 201
if the labor movement, or the chamber of commerce says to members of congress, we support those who support us, that's what they do. %$* 201
they are outside groups. %$* 201
when taxpayer money is being used by the administration, or by the republican leadership in the congress to persuade members to vote a certain way, i think that's something quite different. %$* 201
what do you think it says about the president's political standing right now, that he put his personal capital on the line, the vice president spent several hours last night personally lobbying members, they had half the cabinet there, and yet they still won by basically a vote? %$* 308
what does that say? %$* 308
well, it says they didn't have a good idea in the first place. %$* 201
democrats stood ready to work with the president and the republicans in a bipartisan way to have a good cafta agreement. %$* 201
we could have had over 400 votes. %$* 201
but they refused to put workers' rights and environmental principals as a core part of the treaty. %$* 201
the central american countries would have accepted that. %$* 201
but the u.s. rejected it. %$* 201
so members are smart. %$* 201
they have to -- they represent their district. %$* 201
this is a job loser, yet again another job loser, and it also undermines the workers' rights in central america. %$* 201
so, it's not good for anyone. %$* 201
but madam leader, now as we come to this august recess, the republicans are saying they have a lot of accomplishments, whether you liked it, whether it was pretty or not, they got this trade agreement through, they're about to get the energy bill, the highway bill, they've done tort reform, bankruptcy reform. %$* 308
don't you have to admit there were some accomplishments there, whereas democrats have just been trying to oppose them in every step of the way. %$* 308
well, what i say is this has been a congress of missed opportunities and make matters worse. %$* 201
as far as cafta is concerned, even their own members had to be strong-armed into voting for it, because it's not the right way to go, to use the most recent example. %$* 201
today on the floor is the energy bill, which even the secretary of energy says will not lower prices at the pump for a long time to come and will not reduce our dependence on foreign oil. %$* 201
as far as the transportation bill, it is a good bill. %$* 201
it's two years late. %$* 201
what about one final issue, retirement security? %$* 308
the republicans have been demanding that you put a plan on the table for months now. %$* 308
you finally have put one on the table this week, but it does nothing to address the issue of social security solvency. %$* 308
aren't you ducking that? %$* 308
no, we're not ducking at all. %$* 201
democrats have said from the start, we are the protectors of social security, we will not allow privatization to undermine social security. %$* 201
we will not allow the republicans to continue to rob the social security trust fund. %$* 201
we are about solvency. %$* 201
we are about a lock box. %$* 201
we are about pay-as-you-go, so that the budget deficit does not drain the trust fund of it's resources. %$* 201
that was house minority leader nancy pelosi. %$* 308
coming up we'll turn our attention to america's space program. %$* 308
nasa says discovery is safe, but the rest of the shuttle fleet has been grounded. %$* 308
a look at the latest problems and the future of space flight later on inside politics. %$* 308
right behind me on capitol hill, members of congress are scrambling to get some big things accomplished before their august recess. %$* 308
coming up, the drive to finally pass an energy bill and what that could mean for consumers. %$* 308
plus, is republican senator rick santorum waffling about a run for the white house? %$* 308
we will try to pin him down on that and on the squabbles he's been having with some big named democrats. %$* 308
more on inside politics straight ahead. %$* 308
and as the markets get set to close on wall street, i am joined by christine romans in new york with "the dobbs report." %$* 308
hi there, ed. %$* 369
stocks ending with solid gains for the second day in a row, even though oil prices jumped to nearly $60 a barrel. %$* 369
let's check the dow right now. %$* 369
dow jones industrial average up 69 points, 10,706, and the nasdaq is adding half a percent. %$* 369
united airlines parent company lost $1.4 billion last quarter. %$* 369
that's about five times worse than a year earlier. %$* 369
the loss was due to massive charges for its bankruptcy reorganization, including the government take-over of united's pension plan. %$* 369
separately, united says a threatened strike by its flight attendants is illegal, and as the company put it, will not be tolerated. %$* 369
a tough quarter for united. %$* 369
daimler chrysler is being steered in a new direction. %$* 369
the company's long time ceo, , juergen schrempp, announced he will step down at the end of the year. %$* 369
schrempp has been under fire for failing to boost the stock price since the 1998 merger, as they called it, which he engineered between daimler benz and chrysler. %$* 369
but the rallied on news that he's stepping aside, today gaining nine percent. %$* 369
the environmental protection agency reportedly made an eleventh hour decision to withhold a report that shows a decline in auto fuel economy. %$* 369
that comes just ahead of the house vote this afternoon to pass the massive energy bill. %$* 369
according to "the new york times" that report was supposed to be released today, but the epa decided, for some reason, to delay the release until next week. %$* 369
the times says the report shows the 2004 model vehicle was less fuel efficient than the average new automobile back in the 1980s. %$* 369
00 p.m. eastern on "lou dobbs tonight," the house passed the central american free trade agreement late last night. %$* 412
democrat marcy kaptur voted against it while republican kevin brady voted for it. %$* 412
they'll both join us as part of our extensive coverage of the controversial trade deal. %$* 412
"  senator byron dorgan, congressman richard pombo are co-sponsoring a bill calling for a four-month study of cnooc's offer to buy out unocal. %$* 967
they'll explain why they're trying to defeat that bid. %$* 967
00 eastern, on "lou dobbs tonight" -- ed? %$* 316
thanks, christine. %$* 308
now back to inside politics. %$* 308
members of the house can cross another item off their to-do list before the august recess. %$* 308
they overwhelmingly passed a compromise energy bill today and sent it off to the senate where a vote is expected as early as tomorrow. %$* 308
republicans are calling it a good bill for america, but some democratic opponents are calling it politically and morally wrong. %$* 308
our congressional correspondent, joe johns, has more on the measure and the politics surrounding it. %$* 308
first, the bad news. %$* 360
don't expect american motorists to see much relief from high prices at the gas pump anytime soon, if congress finally finishes up work on the energy bill this week. %$* 360
i think they need to put the gas prices down a little bit. %$* 21
i think it's -- it makes me mad, because it's expensive to get gas. %$* 21
opponents of the energy legislation are keying on consumer frustration and calling the bill, with its $14.5 billion in tax breaks and incentives, a gift to industry. %$* 360
tax breaks for big oil and gas companies. %$* 968
loan guarantees for the wealthiest energy companies in america, even as they are reporting the largest quarterly profits of any corporations in the history of the united states. %$* 968
but in the long term, the hope is the energy bill will have an impact on the national economy by encouraging development of new energy ideas and increased uses of existing technologies. %$* 360
there are provisions in this bill that says it's ok to use clean coal, it's ok to build a new nuclear power plant in this country, if we do it the proper way with the proper permits and the proper inspections. %$* 969
the nuclear power industry is a big winner, getting new tax breaks and loan guarantees designed to rev up business. %$* 360
hybrid cars will get a boost, too. %$* 360
there's a tax credit for people who buy them. %$* 360
the bill also promises renewed efforts to boost the use of coal, and there are provisions to modernize the electricity grid to prevent future blackouts, like the one that darkened the northeast in 2003. %$* 360
the bill also expands daylight saving time for one month, which proponents claim will save 100,000 barrels of oil a day. %$* 360
and the bill authorizes $3.5 billion for hydrogen and fuel-cell research. %$* 360
this is, of course, the rush to get something done before the august recess begins. %$* 360
and if this energy bill goes through, along with cafta, the transportation bill, members of congress will be able to go home and say they did, in fact, get something done. %$* 360
it also gives the president an opportunity to chalk up a couple wins, although, as you've already reported, ed, in the case of cafta, it wasn't necessarily pretty. %$* 360
joe johns, from the capitol. %$* 308
thanks, joe. %$* 308
we now want to turn back to texas where we've had this developing, breaking story all afternoon. %$* 308
we've had an explosion that tore through a chemical plant on the north side of ft. worth. %$* 308
you can see live pictures right there. %$* 308
firefighters desperately trying to put those flames out. %$* 308
concerns about the chemicals from that plant possibly wafting throughout that area. %$* 308
we now want to go to a reporter on the scene right there, jim grimes. %$* 308
he's a reporter with our affiliate there at ft. worth, kdaf. %$* 308
jim, give us an idea of what you can see. %$* 308
well, ed, right now, obviously firefighters have their hands full. %$* 254
you can see behind me all that black smoke going up in the air. %$* 254
all of that chemicals that are burning, a dozen different chemicals are actually on fire inside that warehouse. %$* 254
firefighters tell us, at this point, they've actually stopped putting water on it. %$* 254
there's an explosion you can see. %$* 254
explosions have been coming periodically, every few minutes or so. %$* 254
but firefighters tell us they're going to stop putting water on this fire, because they're concerned that that water's going to mix with the chemicals and then they're going to have a runoff problem. %$* 254
but, again, all of the smoke from this fire is also causing some big problems. %$* 254
they're worried that maybe some residents downwind from this are going to be affected. %$* 254
they've actually pushed us back several blocks, because they're concerned about what's in that smoke. %$* 254
but, again, firefighters right now say they're going to let this thing burn itself out. %$* 254
now, we do know that this explosion actually happened about two hours ago. %$* 254
they're not sure exactly what caused it to happen. %$* 254
but several people were injured, but only minor injuries. %$* 254
those people were taken to a nearby hospital. %$* 254
they're expected to be ok. %$* 254
so two stories, actually, taking place here right now, the fire itself trying to be contained and then the smoke. %$* 254
a totally different issue. %$* 254
it's also galvanized some of the traffic around this area. %$* 254
there's a major highway just on the other side of this that's right along downtown ft. worth. %$* 254
and traffic there right now is just gridlocked. %$* 254
so it's quite a mess out here, as you can imagine. %$* 254
jim, can you give us an idea of what kind of chemicals -- have authorities said anything about what kind of chemicals they are? %$* 308
have they been specific? %$* 308
well, they did say that there was about a dozen different chemicals. %$* 254
what this plant does, it stores these chemicals in huge 2,000-gallon drums, phosphoric acid, some chlorine, and all types of different chemicals, all of them very hazardous, especially when they're burning. %$* 254
so these drums that they're in actually exploded. %$* 254
and that's what we've been seeing. %$* 254
and i know you've been showing the video, some of those explosions. %$* 254
those happen periodically. %$* 254
but all the chemicals inside here extremely dangerous. %$* 254
thank you very much. %$* 308
reporting from the scene -- stay safe -- jim grimes from our affiliate kdaf in ft. worth. %$* 308
we will return to that story throughout the afternoon as news warrants. %$* 308
but back here in washington, the tit-for-tat in the senate continues over john roberts' records, when his confirmation hearings should begin, and what is fair game for senators to ask the supreme court nominee. %$* 308
is there anything about judge roberts that can bring the left and right together? %$* 308
well, here's our senior political analyst, bill schneider. %$* 308
the principle of judicial activism is a bad thing. %$* 317
that's something everyone can agree on. %$* 317
it's becoming the test for whether john roberts should be confirmed for the supreme court. %$* 317
when president bush nominated roberts, he cited his aversion to judicial activism as a key qualification. %$* 317
he will strictly apply the constitution and laws, not legislate from the bench. %$* 161
conservatives have been assailing activist judges for decades for inventing new rights, like the right to privacy that conservatives argue are not in the constitution, for overruling democratically enacted laws, like laws banning late-term abortions. %$* 317
documents from roberts' early public service revealed that he, too, endorsed judicial restraint, something he repeated in his 2003 confirmation hearing for the federal appeals court. %$* 317
there's no role for advocacy, with respect to personal beliefs or views on the part of a judge. %$* 405
roberts does have political views, of course. %$* 317
i think what those files show is a young white house staffer helping to provide legal analysis and support of the president's agenda, of president reagan's agenda. %$* 314
democrats are now raising the issue of judicial activism. %$* 317
they argue conservative judges are rolling back abortion rights and civil rights and overturning democratically enacted laws, like environmental protection laws. %$* 317
sen. patrick leahy , vermont:  an independent study -- and i referred to this earlier -- demonstrated the rehnquist court has been the most activist court in my lifetime in overturning congressional enactments and restricting legislative authority. %$* 317
actually, the most activist since the new deal, before the new deal. %$* 317
democrats want it know whether roberts will bring an ideological agenda to the supreme court. %$* 317
he told me flatly he is not an ideologue and that he shares my aversion to ideologues. %$* 408
at his 2003 confirmation hearings, roberts said he regarded the roe v. wade decision as, quote, "settled law," but attorney general gonzales recent told the associated press, "if you're asking a circuit court judge, yes, it is settled law because you're bound by the precedent. %$* 317
a supreme court justice is not obliged to follow precedent if you believe it's wrong." %$* 317
does that mean roberts might vote to overturn roe? %$* 317
later, the justice department clarified the attorney general's statement, calling it a purely factual statement about how our court system operates, rather than an indication of how roberts would address the abortion issue. %$* 317
we know roberts is a conservative. %$* 317
and we know he has been critical of judicial activism. %$* 317
which view will prevail when he goes on the supreme court? %$* 317
that will be the central question at his confirmation hearings. %$* 317
now, bill, you've been following these confirmation hearings, many of them over the years, whether it's bork or thomas. %$* 308
has the standard for judicial activism changed over the years? %$* 308
no, it changes -- look, for particular cases. %$* 317
i can remember a time when the brown decision ending school segregation was considered an activist decision. %$* 317
and a lot of people still consider roe, that gave abortion rights, an activist decision. %$* 317
but nowadays, if you say -- if you raise any questions about brown, or if you say you want to overturn roe, that's considered judicial activism. %$* 317
ok, bill schneider, our senior political analyst, thank you. %$* 308
senator hillary clinton famously wrote that it takes a village. %$* 308
but senator rick santorum says it takes a family. %$* 308
up next, the republican talks about his controversial new book, his tips with democrats, and his presidential plans, maybe. %$* 308
in britain, a closing chapter in a history of terror. %$* 308
we'll discuss the irish republican army's decision to disarm. %$* 308
and when we go "inside the blogs," find out who's in the boy scouts' camp online? %$* 308
senator rick santorum is hardly a political wallflower, but he's been making more headlines than usual as of late, by sending mixed signals about his presidential ambitions and by promoting his controversial new book, "it takes a family." %$* 308
i spoke with the pennsylvania republican today. %$* 308
i started by asking him why he wrote the book. %$* 308
i wrote the book because of the work that i've been doing on what most people would call a compassionate conservative agenda. %$* 550
i talked to the publishers -- the eventual publishers, and they came to me and said, "you know, you're doing a lot of work up on the poor. %$* 550
it's a different conservative vision of the role of government in people's lives. %$* 550
and you should really sit down and put this on paper," sort of put some sort of theoretical underpinnings to what the president says he wants to accomplish with the faith-based initiative, which i've been active on, and welfare reform, and a whole host of things. %$* 550
so that's how i started to write it. %$* 550
and i was talking to a lot of people that i've worked with out in the field. %$* 550
and what i found was, the more i talked to people, and the more i looked into it, the more i realized that the communities that are hurting the most are the ones were family breakdown is the greatest. %$* 550
and that, if we were going to really solve problems in dealing with poverty and systemic poverty in america, you can't ignore the family. %$* 550
in fact, it takes a family to stabilize communities, to stabilize children's lives. %$* 550
and so i ended up writing a much broader book, because i wanted to talk about all the societal influences on the family, both from the government, from the culture, from academia, and how they have systematically, in my opinion, pulverized and broken apart the family, particularly among the poor, and what we need to do as a society to rebuild that family. %$* 550
but do you think that, as you make those points, that maybe some of the rhetoric in the book went too far? %$* 308
there was a "pittsburgh post-gazette" editorial saying, quote, "if senator santorum wants to convert people to his brand of compassionate conservatism, he needs to deliver his preachments with less attitude." %$* 308
the "pittsburgh post-gazette" is probably one of the most hostile papers in the country toward me. %$* 550
and i won't even -- the "pittsburgh post-gazette" is not going to be lecturing me on attitude. %$* 550
these are folks who just criticized jon stewart on the "daily show," because he wasn't mean to me. %$* 550
but is it a fair point that maybe you went a little far in the rhetoric for shock value, and that that's undermining... %$* 970
i didn't go for shock value. %$* 550
most people who have interacted with me in public life and in personal life know that i try to be very honest and upfront with people. %$* 550
and i try to lay out things very clearly. %$* 550
and i don't think there's anything -- if people read this book, and i encourage people to read this book -- the more people who read this book, i feel the better off i'm going to be. %$* 550
if people read this book, they're going to see there's no shock value in here. %$* 550
they may have pulled out one or two sentences out of a 440-page book and out of context they may look, you know, sort of tough, but in context, and in the sweep of this book, i think you see the heart that i try to give to conservatism on these issues. %$* 550
let's pick out one issue, and you give us that context: abortion. %$* 308
it's about to be front and center in the supreme court nomination battle. %$* 308
you write in the book -- you basically compare abortion to slavery and say that you feel that the mother has more rights than the child, just as a slave-owner had more rights than a slave. %$* 308
a lot of people hit you over that. %$* 308
you have a chance now to say, what did you mean by that? %$* 308
here's what i say. %$* 550
and if you look at slavery, what we did was say that the slave was property, wasn't a person, and therefore didn't have constitutional rights. %$* 550
and what do we do with a child in a womb? %$* 550
well, the child is either a person or it's property. %$* 550
and we say that the child, under the constitution, is not a person, therefore it's the property of the mother. %$* 550
i find that somewhat chilling that we would revisit a very ugly chapter in american history where we take a human being -- and no one denies it's a human being -- and treat it as property. %$* 550
and that is something that we should guard against as a society, and to learn from history so we're not revisited by what i think are cataclysmic effects of that history. %$* 550
let's talk politics. %$* 308
you have a big race in pennsylvania, one of the most closely watched senate races of 2006. %$* 308
how is this book going to affect it? %$* 308
democrats think it's going to put you away, because they think your views are too extreme. %$* 308
you know, if i could, i'd buy a copy for everybody in pennsylvania and have them read it. %$* 550
and i think this is a book, if people read this book and take the time to do it, then 80 percent of pennsylvanians will say, "you know what? %$* 550
this is just pretty good common sense." %$* 550
they may not agree with every single thing that's in the book, but 90 percent of the things that are in this book, 80 percent of pennsylvanians are going to agree with, or more. %$* 550
i feel very comfortable that i wrote a book that's from my heart, that talks about my vision for the people of pennsylvania in this country, and they're very much within the mainstream of thought in pennsylvania. %$* 550
how might this affect a potential race in 2008? %$* 308
you basically said last week that you had intention of running for president. %$* 308
then, this week, you told the "philadelphia enquirer," "well"... %$* 308
i repeated i have no intention of running for president. %$* 550
and i was asked the question, "well, is there any circumstance in which you would?" %$* 550
i said, "well, it's three years from now. %$* 550
to suggest that there might not be some circumstance, as remote as it might be, that i would do, i can't say absolutely no." %$* 550
but i have no intention of doing it. %$* 550
i'm running for reelection. %$* 550
i'm running for the whip position, which is the number-two leadership position in the senate. %$* 550
i wouldn't be doing that if i was going to turn around and say, "well, see you, guys. %$* 550
i'm going to go off to new hampshire and you're not going to see me." %$* 550
so unlikely, but a door's open? %$* 308
well, i wouldn't say the door's -- i mean, ok. %$* 550
it's not locked and bolted, but the door itself is closed. %$* 550
it's just not locked. %$* 550
but it might be opened? %$* 308
yes, well... %$* 550
thank you, senator santorum, for joining us. %$* 308
my pleasure. %$* 550
thank you. %$* 550
senator rick santorum's door, not locked. %$* 308
checking the day's "political bytes," rick santorum's not the only potential presidential hopeful making some headlines. %$* 308
senators hillary clinton and john mccain, arguably the most high-profile would- be candidates from their respective parties, are making two joint appearances today. %$* 308
this morning, they helped kick off an effort to build a new rehab center for disabled military vets. %$* 308
tonight, they are both expected to attend the world premier of "the great raid," a new film about world war ii. %$* 308
meanwhile, arkansas governor mike huckabee is the latest potential white house candidate to head for new hampshire. %$* 308
organizers say huckabee will be the keynote speaker at next month's stratford county republican picnic, pig roast and family night. %$* 308
next, an update on today's announcement that the ira has renounced violence, when i talk with sinn fein leader martin mcguinness. %$* 308
also, we'll join our blog reporters for the latest online debates over karl rove and the john roberts nomination. %$* 308
the irish republican army announced today that it will resume disarmament and that it will no longer commit acts of violence. %$* 308
gerry adams, who leads the ira's political wing, sinn fein, called today's announcement "historic." %$* 308
but the leader of northern ireland's dominant protestant party called the move a, quote, "hollow gesture." %$* 308
the u.s. and british governments expressed cautious optimism today following the announcement. %$* 308
with me now to discuss today's events is martin mcguinness. %$* 308
he's the chief negotiator for sinn fein. %$* 308
welcome, mr. mcguinness. %$* 308
thank you, ed. %$* 971
i wanted to start by asking you -- we're already hearing some skeptics say, "we've heard this before." %$* 308
why are we to believe that now the terrorism is finally over? %$* 308
well, i think that there is no doubt whatsoever that what we have witnessed today is truly historic and momentous. %$* 971
and i think time will prove that to be the case. %$* 971
i hope that those who are skeptical will recognize that a tremendous opportunity is in the process of being created. %$* 971
it's one that should not be lost, because i think there is a huge responsibility, a mighty responsibility, on all political leaders to work together to ensure the restoration of the good friday institutions, which have been endorsed overwhelmingly by all of the people of ireland. %$* 971
but, now, there's been a ceasefire since 1997. %$* 308
why has it taken eight years to lead to this point, where we're finally hearing "disarmament"? %$* 308
well, it's simply because we have been plagued by all sorts of problems and difficulties within the process. %$* 971
we have had unionist opposition to the implementation of the good friday agreement. %$* 971
we have had ongoing activities by unionist paramilitaries who have been attacking catholics in their homes and, of course, unionists are among the groups that have been killing one another. %$* 971
so it's been a very, very difficult process. %$* 971
and now we've seen a very decisive, but i think a very honest, move by the ira to end their armed campaign, to put their weapons beyond use. %$* 971
i believe them when they say they will do that. %$* 971
i believe them when they say that their volunteers will not be involved in any activities whatsoever. %$* 971
and i think that we're on the threshold of a bright new phase in irish politics. %$* 971
now, when gerry adams came to washington for st. patrick's day back in march, politicians like senator edward kennedy refused to meet with him because of the violence. %$* 308
you've been going around on capitol hill today with people like congressman richard neal, other senators, as well as house members. %$* 308
what's the reaction on the hill? %$* 308
do people believe it now and really feel like the violence will end? %$* 308
yes. %$* 971
i think people here do appreciate the enormous significance of what has happened today. %$* 971
i think people are energized and enthused by this. %$* 971
i think that they know there is a very real possibility now of restoring the good friday institutions. %$* 971
and, of course, as we know, the political representatives of irish america are very fervent in their beliefs that this can lead to irish reunification. %$* 971
and someone who has worked all of his life to bring about a united ireland, i think that we have before us now a process which we can all engage in by exclusively peaceful and democratic means. %$* 971
and now the ira have signed up for that. %$* 971
it's a tremendous day. %$* 971
mr. mcguinness, i wonder, while it seems unrelated, the recent terrorism that's unrelated to the ira in london, did that have any effect on this in getting sinn fein to say, "enough is enough." %$* 308
you've seen this kind of terrorism. %$* 308
did that finally help push it along at all, seeing the horror of the recent terrorism in london? %$* 308
well, of course, we deplore what happened in london. %$* 971
we are totally and absolutely opposed to it. %$* 971
but i remind people that gerry adams made his call, his appeal to the ira on april the 6th, long before there ever were bombs in london, in which he appealed to the volunteer men and women of the ira to accept an alternative way forward by exclusively peaceful and democratic means. %$* 971
they engaged in a wide-ranging discussion themselves for recent months. %$* 971
and now, we've had a conclusion of all of that. %$* 971
and i have to say, i, and, indeed, many others, are well-satisfied with what we've heard today. %$* 971
and we wish to build on that to ensure the restoration of the good friday institutions. %$* 971
now, a final question:  is there a timetable for completing this disarmament, and how will it actually be verified? %$* 308
well, i think the key person in all of this is general de chastelain, representing canada and andrew sens, a diplomat here from the united states, who are people of great integrity. %$* 971
and i am very confident that, if we leave this issue between the ira and those two particular gentlemen, that we will see a resolution of this issue very shortly. %$* 971
thank you very much, martin mcguinness. %$* 308
he's the chief negotiator for sinn fein. %$* 308
he's on capitol hill today gauging reaction and discussing this historic day. %$* 308
thank you. %$* 308
thank you. %$* 971
turning back to domestic politics, the cia leak investigation is keeping the blogosphere very busy. %$* 308
let's check in with cnn political producer abbi tatton and jacki schechner, our blog reporter -- jacki? %$* 308
hi, ed. %$* 325
well, in an investigation where the special prosecutor has pretty much asked everyone to keep quiet, what little we are finding out is plenty to keep the conversation itself going. %$* 325
but as mark in mexico points out -- this is markinmexico.blogspot.com -- "it is not the people at the center of the inquiry itself who are doing much of the talking. %$* 325
and the whole thing is becoming very circus-like." %$* 325
the latest act coming from the huffington post. %$* 325
you might remember, this is the group blog where lawrence o'donnell first posted that karl rove was matt cooper's source. %$* 325
though, that little tidbit turned out to be true, today's over at the huffington post is by arianna herself. %$* 325
and this is her using conjecture to connect the dots. %$* 325
and in this information vacuum, the focus of speculation on the web seems to change daily. %$* 384
some days it's ari fleischer. %$* 384
some days it's scooter libby. %$* 384
some days it's karl rove. %$* 384
in fact, most of the time it's karl rove. %$* 384
but today, a lot of the speculation seems to be centered around judith miller, the "new york times" reporter and what involvement she had, what was her role in the summer of 2003 that the investigation is focused on. %$* 384
now, of course, this is all speculation. %$* 384
we don't know the facts. %$* 384
judith miller is spending her 22nd day in prison. %$* 384
she is not talking about this. %$* 384
but other bloggers are. %$* 384
they are talking about this post. %$* 384
it really is doing the rounds. %$* 384
they're talking about it on the left and the right. %$* 384
kevin drum over at political animal at the "washington monthly" references the second of two nuggets that have come out today. %$* 86
arianna's theory being the first of those two, and then a "new york times" article putting forth the theory that there may be a third white house official that is involved in this investigation beyond rove and libby. %$* 86
he urges caution, says this is all speculation. %$* 86
we will do the same. %$* 86
yes, that's the rove story. %$* 384
there's a lot of talk on that, but there's a lot of talk also on another washington story this summer in the blogosphere, and that is the nomination of john roberts to the supreme court. %$* 384
there's been lots of questions asked online, lots of people putting forward ideas that the judiciary committee members should be asking in those nomination hearings when they happen in the next few weeks. %$* 384
well, a group of senators today has put together a web site so people can go online and ask those questions, led by senator barbara mikulski of maryland and six of her female democratic colleagues. %$* 384
you can go to her site, click through here to the button that says, "it's your supreme court." %$* 384
and you can say, "what would you ask judge roberts?" %$* 384
fill in your name, ask your question, and forward it to this group of senators. %$* 384
they'll be monitoring the questions as they come in, and the questions will form the material they send forward to the judiciary committee. %$* 384
so this is a group of senators here, engaging people online, letting them join in the nomination process -- ed? %$* 384
thank you, abbi and jacki. %$* 308
the "strategy session" is straight ahead on inside politics. %$* 308
today, president bush goes the extra mile to capitol hill and it was just enough. %$* 308
cafta, what went down in the middle of the night and what's the political fallout? %$* 308
when we come back. %$* 308
welcome back to inside politics and our "strategy session" in today's hottest political topics. %$* 308
with us today, democratic strategist vic kamber and cnn political analyst robert novak. %$* 308
today's topics, wheeling and dealing, now that the trade pact has swept through the congress on some high profile lobbying, will it pay off as the president promised? %$* 308
judging roberts. %$* 308
the questionnaire arrives, and the supreme court nominee faces a grilling by senators, even before his hearings start. %$* 308
and the central american free trade agreement is bound for president bush's desk after overnight house action. %$* 308
the yeas are 217, the nays are 215, the bill has passed. %$* 21
president bush is getting much of the credit for the trade bill's two-vote passage. %$* 308
mr. bush paid a rare visit to capitol hill yesterday, had vice president cheney there, as well, lobbying. %$* 308
the high powered wheeling and dealing apparently paid off. %$* 308
but will cafta pay off for the u.s.? %$* 308
vic, i wonder from a strategy standpoint, having the president put so much political capital on the line and go there yesterday on the hill, rare visit, and then just barely eke it out in a republican-dominated congress, from a strategy point of view, do you think that was a mistake. %$* 308
no, frankly, he needed a win. %$* 783
it's not been a good year for the president since his election. %$* 783
the best part for him was the election, and, frankly, it's been downhill since then in many ways. %$* 783
he needed a win. %$* 783
this was an important piece of legislation for him. %$* 783
i think -- to have prestige and power and not use it is ridiculous. %$* 783
he used his prestige and his power. %$* 783
i question some of the tactics. %$* 783
but he used it and he was very effective. %$* 783
bob, does it show him to be a little bit weak that he put out that much effort? %$* 308
no, i agree with vic, it's a big plus for him. %$* 493
these trade bills remind me a little bit of professional wrestling, because the president, whichever party, always wins. %$* 493
he wins by a little bit. %$* 493
there's always all of this dramatic thing in the middle of the night with congressmen being given highways and goodness knows what else. %$* 493
and they always squeak through. %$* 493
and i just said earlier in the year when they were 30, 40 points behind, he'll win that. %$* 493
now it's funny you mention those highways. %$* 308
today the house minority leader nancy pelosi basically charged that there may have been bribery on the house floor and suggested there was more than that. %$* 308
let's take a listen to what she said. %$* 308
i do know of a report that had been made to me about offers that were made to democrats and they came running in, saying -- didn't sound like it passed the legal muster to me. %$* 201
but they know what they've done. %$* 201
and they know it's at additional cost to the u.s. taxpayer. %$* 201
you should ask them. %$* 201
bob, you've been in this town a long time. %$* 308
does it pass the legal muster or is it just business as usual. %$* 308
nancy reminds me of the guy in casablanca, you know, shocking there's gambling going on here. %$* 493
they've been doing that for a long time. %$* 493
the interesting thing is not that. %$* 493
that's all sad. %$* 493
the interesting thing is there was 17 democratic votes for a trade bill. %$* 493
democratic party is now the protectionist party. %$* 493
the traditional party of andrew jackson, free trade, has been moving that way for years and it's there now. %$* 493
it's the protectionist party which is not a winning formula in america. %$* 493
vic, how about that, and the fact that organized labor was trying to show some muscle in telling democrats on the hill, you better not vote for this. %$* 308
and then, as bob notes, a lot of democrats did vote for it and it passed. %$* 308
organized labor, after this crack up at the afl-cio,  is there clout waning. %$* 308
well, first of all, a lot of democrats didn't vote for it. %$* 783
yes, i mean, the numbers are very small. %$* 783
and i think some of those democrats will have a high price to pay in terms of trying to get future support from some of those labor unions. %$* 783
i think the unions will hold back some money and some support. %$* 783
some of those democrats, frankly, were marginal to begin with. %$* 783
having said that, you know, it was clearly a lobbyist bill this one, republicans won. %$* 783
the president won. %$* 783
everybody else lost, meaning labor and whoever else was on the other side. %$* 783
you have to give the president his due. %$* 783
and, bob, was a lot on the line for the president here? %$* 308
i mean, it seemed like a small trade deal. %$* 308
but was it the fact that he's having so much trouble on social security and other issues that he had to get a win? %$* 308
it's prestige. %$* 493
it was small to you but it was big to central america. %$* 493
i met with the president of nicaragua two weeks ago -- was in town. %$* 493
he's about ready to get impeached. %$* 493
he's fighting the sandonistas. %$* 493
he's got all hell to pay and all he could talk about was this trade agreement. %$* 493
it's a big deal in central america. %$* 493
all those governments, various kinds of governments, wanted it. %$* 493
now what about some of the back room deals? %$* 308
you've been tracking the story of republican charley taylor. %$* 308
he apparently tried to vote no, but the machine didn't pick it up. %$* 308
do you know a little bit about that. %$* 308
charley taylor was against it. %$* 493
his vote wasn't recorded and he says he actually voted. %$* 493
he comes from a north carolina republican district. %$* 493
he's supposed to be very marginal. %$* 493
he wins by about 54, 56 percent of the vote. %$* 493
but he gave the dog ate my homework excuse, and that is that he put his card in and it didn't work. %$* 493
but there was one other person who didn't vote, joann davis from virginia. %$* 493
and she had gone to the boy scout jamboree and she got caught in suburban traffic and couldn't get back. %$* 493
now isn't that the great excuse for not voting, i got caught in traffic. %$* 493
now, vic, just to wrap it up though. %$* 308
bill clinton never offered up bridges to get nafta, for example, in 1993? %$* 308
not that i'm aware of. %$* 783
i'm like bob. %$* 783
we know those things happen. %$* 783
i hope nancy's wrong, frankly, i hope that she's wrong and it didn't go over the bounds of ethics. %$* 783
i mean, but the bottom line is, the country is split, the congress is split, and you do what you have to do. %$* 783
hopefully within the law. %$* 783
ok.  we have to leave it there. %$* 308
when inside politics returns, demands for documents and some answers. %$* 308
supreme court nominee john roberts finds himself the subject of an inquiring website and a ten-page questionnaire. %$* 308
the "strategy session" continues on inside politics. %$* 308
still here, vic kamber and robert novak. %$* 308
president bush's supreme court nominee is still turning on the charm with more visits to capitol hill. %$* 308
on his schedule today, sitdowns with democratic senators ben nelson and mary landrieu. %$* 308
roberts yesterday received a 10 page questionnaire in advance of his confirmation hearings. %$* 308
senate democrats are demanding documents. %$* 308
and others have launched a web site to post questions to roberts. %$* 308
one republican senator says he's concerned some are trying to turn roberts confirmation into a political circus. %$* 308
after recent media reports, i've become concerned that some of those fears i spoke of earlier on this floor are coming true. %$* 193
namely, that our friends on the other side of the aisle are going to do everything they can to obstruct the confirmation process of the president's nominee to the supreme court. %$* 193
how about it, vic? %$* 308
the last couple of days, we've started hearing democrats raising questions about when the hearings are going to start, how many pages of documents are going to come over and republicans are insisting this is a losing strategy, that basically this confirmation is pretty far along already. %$* 308
is it smart for the democrats to be picking these little fights? %$* 308
or should they just get on board? %$* 308
well, i'm a believer it's smart for republicans or democrats to make sure they know what they've got in this package. %$* 783
we're talking about a man who's 50 years of age with, hoping he has health -- he could be on that court for 25, 30 years, making decisions that affect our lives. %$* 783
i don't think anything's out of bounds in terms of finding out as much about him, what he believes, what he stands for, as possible. %$* 783
i would expect from what we know already, he's going to be confirmed it looks like. %$* 783
but i think the democrats would be ill served -- i as a democrat would be ill served if those politicians and democrats on the senate don't ask all the questions possible. %$* 783
how about it, bob, are they out in left field on this? %$* 308
it's a waste of time. %$* 493
vic is right the first time, he's going to be confirmed. %$* 493
this is the worst nightmare for democrats. %$* 493
just go back a month. %$* 493
they thought that rehnquist was going to go and you put one conservative in for another conservative. %$* 493
but sandra day o'connor was a liberal judge on social questions. %$* 493
she really was. %$* 493
and she was the swing vote on a lot of questions. %$* 493
and here they have named another scalia. %$* 493
he is another scalia. %$* 493
people who served with him on the d.c. court of appeals. %$* 493
but he's a soft spoken scalia. %$* 493
that's why he's a nightmare. %$* 493
he's not going to say anything stupid. %$* 493
and there's no way to get at him. %$* 493
and you know, i love the story today ben nelson, kind of a pompous conservative democrat from nebraska says he told him he's not going to be an activist judge. %$* 493
now can you imagine going into roberts, i'm going to be an activist judge. %$* 493
how about it, vic. %$* 308
and once he's on that court, there's nothing can touch him. %$* 493
and that's the point. %$* 783
i mean, i think bob said is correctly. %$* 783
once he's on the court, there's nothing can touch him. %$* 783
so, i think we have an obligation, win or not, you know, let's assume he's going to be confirmed. %$* 783
i still want to know about him. %$* 783
i still want to know this country to know about him. %$* 783
i think the senate has an obligation to know about him. %$* 783
and in the end, if he comes out as clean as bob is projecting and the president is projecting, he'll win. %$* 783
but there are fair questions, and there are fair questions, and then there are questions that are out of bounds. %$* 308
like what? %$* 783
republicans are suggesting that the question from democrat dick durbin last friday when he allegedly asked judge roberts whether or not his catholic faith would have any effect on his rulings on the high court, republicans are saying that's out of bounds. %$* 308
and in fact, a letter just went out from, obviously, long-time catholic henry hyde, republican congressman, we all know him. %$* 308
he wrote it to dick durbin saying, quote, "practicing catholics need not apply, can not become a rallying cry of modern day religious bigots who would seek to drive from the public square all federal office candidates of faith. %$* 308
i hope that your question to judge roberts, if accurately reported, does not constitute an opening salvo in a process in which the candidate's faith will constitute sufficient justification for denying him a speedy confirmation." %$* 308
fair or not to ask about his catholic faith? %$* 308
well, i think it's important that we have elected officials, politicians, judges who are of faith. %$* 783
and i think that -- i commend judge roberts for his faith. %$* 783
now, is out of bounds to ask somebody where they put their faith against the laws of our land? %$* 783
i don't know. %$* 783
i mean, you know, we went through this in '60 with kennedy. %$* 783
i'm not a catholic. %$* 783
republicans during the clinton administration had asked ruth bader ginsberg whether her jewish faith would affect her decision, do you think democrats would have been screaming about that? %$* 308
kamber:  well, they would have been screaming, but we're talking about -- it depends what they would have asked. %$* 308
i'm saying in the catholic church, and bob may be better to talk about it -- in the catholic church. %$* 308
let's give bob 15 seconds. %$* 308
this is a tremendous blunder by senator durbin, absolutely a huge blunder for him to say that. %$* 493
and it is a -- it's a huge mistake. %$* 493
people are talking about it. %$* 493
it's the second mistake he's made in two weeks. %$* 493
and you just don't say things like that. %$* 493
it happened in the green room at nbc. %$* 493
a lot of bad things happen in green rooms. %$* 493
you've never been in the green room. %$* 493
but i'm telling you, people think they're soundproof in there and they say dumb things. %$* 493
but isn't the faith question, don't we need to know where he puts his faith against the law? %$* 783
no. %$* 493
i'll tell you what that is, that is absolutely inexcusable, and over the line. %$* 493
bob novak who's been in a lot of green rooms. %$* 308
vic kamber, he's been in some green rooms well as well. %$* 308
disappointing news for nasa, the discovery astronauts get to complete their mission, but it's anyone's guess when we see the next one. %$* 308
when we return, the impact of the latest setback for the shuttle program. %$* 308
i'm zain verjee reporting from the cnn center in atlanta. %$* 613
coming up at the top of the hour, one week after the july 21st bombing attempts in london, police are still looking for three of the four suspects. %$* 613
the discovery space shuttle docks with the international space station, but new findings revive serious concerns about shuttle safety. %$* 613
and millions of americans use echinacea to fight colds, but does it really work? %$* 613
all those stories and much more just minutes away on "wolf blitzer reports." %$* 613
for now though, back to inside politics. %$* 613
nasa's announcement that the discovery crew is safe, but space shuttle flights have been grounded is the latest challenge for scientists planning future space exploration. %$* 308
cnn's bruce morton has more on how the space program is struggling to remain relevant in the eyes of the american public. %$* 308
three, two, one. %$* 21
it looked splendid leaving the launch pad, all 2 million parts of it, cost about half a billion dollars per mission, 4,000 workers at the kennedy space center to maintain it. %$* 321
but, it's elderly, it's technology goes back to the 1970s before ipods, before blackberries. %$* 321
you get the idea. %$* 321
and then it turned out some foam had come loose from the external fuel tank, a problem similar to the one that destroyed columbia. %$* 321
discovery has docked with the space station and is apparently unharmed. %$* 321
but the shuttles are grounded again. %$* 321
the team has worked hard, very hard, for two-and-a-half years to get the tank to be absolutely as clean as it can be. %$* 972
we missed this one. %$* 972
we'll fix it before we fly again. %$* 972
two-and-a-half years and you haven't fixed this? %$* 321
embarrassment? %$* 321
oh yes. %$* 321
i think it's hard to overstate just how big a disappointment this is to nasa. %$* 973
after a couple of years of work and more than a couple hundred million dollars, they still have the same problems that they had when columbia launched. %$* 973
the shuttles are supposed to last until 2010, but exactly what will replace them isn't clear. %$* 321
right now, we're planning on flying the shuttle until 2010 using it to assemble the international space station and then moving on with a return of u.s. astronauts to the moon. %$* 972
and the space station is behind schedule and over budget. %$* 321
and who knows how long this new delay may be? %$* 321
i think it's a little premature to start talking about retiring the shuttle early. %$* 973
but i do think it's a big question as far as when they're going to be able to fly the shuttle again. %$* 973
i don't see any way that the mission scheduled for september aboard atlantis can fly right now. %$* 973
in fact, most people seem to think they're done for at least the rest of 2005. %$* 973
and that may make it harder to sell the program to congress and the public. %$* 321
a cnn/usa today/gallup poll last month showed three out of five americans oppose manned flights to mars. %$* 321
the president's grand plans for manned exploration of mars seem to most americans to be out of sync with the real problems they confront in their everyday lives. %$* 563
and this setback is certainly going to contribute to that sentiment. %$* 563
discovery seems to have survived its launch in good safe shape. %$* 321
you can't say that for the space program as a whole. %$* 321
bruce morton, cnn, washington. %$* 321
the national boy scout jamboree is underway. %$* 308
and the scouts are facing tough challenges. %$* 308
we'll check in on some scout blogs next when we rejoin our blog reporters. %$* 308
president bush has rescheduled his appearance at the boy scout jamboree for this weekend, but it has already been a very tough week for the scouts. %$* 308
for more, let's rejoin cnn political producer abbi tatton and jacki schechner, our blog reporter -- jacki. %$* 308
ed, it has been a tough week. %$* 325
that's even an understatement at this point. %$* 325
on monday, tragedy struck the jamboree as four scout leaders were killed in a horrible accident. %$* 325
president bush who was scheduled to speak yesterday, that postponed now until sunday due to severe weather. %$* 325
and then yesterday, hundreds of scouts and adults were treated for heat-related illnesses as they stood waiting for the opening ceremonies. %$* 325
as one of the blogs put it today, we've seen this echoed, "the scout jamboree is officially cursed. %$* 325
can they just go home now or what?" %$* 325
there are a number of scouts and educators blogging from the jamboree this week. %$* 384
one of them is emeritbadges.blogspot.com, a group of technology educators who had been blogging about the tragedy, then overcoming it. %$* 384
they were saying yesterday that the whole camp was abuzz with anticipation of the president's arrival. %$* 384
lots of people filing down to the arena. %$* 384
they say they were promising their readers lots of photos as they came down of the event. %$* 384
but the photos show that nothing went as planned. %$* 384
they showed that the scouts were being sprayed with water as the heat rose, the temperatures rose in the afternoon. %$* 384
and then later on, the ambulance coming to treat the victims of heat related illnesses there. %$* 384
there's another site here, one of the -- at "the richmond times dispatch" where parents are weighing in on what was happening. %$* 384
one woman saying that she went there with her sons. %$* 384
it was a horrible day. %$* 384
she saw people lying on the ground being treated. %$* 384
we have one boy scout who is blogging for his hometown paper. %$* 384
this is lloyd fouler, he's an 8th grader, 14-years-old. %$* 384
and he says that today, luckily, it is much cooler. %$* 384
but points out that the bus lines are very long and the events are very spread out at the jamboree, so the kids have to walk very far to get to where they're going and they need lots and lots of water. %$* 384
we will send it back to you. %$* 384
thanks, jacki and abbi. %$* 308
that's it for inside politics. %$* 308
i'm ed henry. %$* 308
"wolf blitzer reports" starts right now. %$* 308

mourning in ohio. %$* 116
this deadly week for u.s. forces in iraq drives home the anguish on the home front, and it takes a political toll on president bush. %$* 116
if people want to come here, they come here and they play by our rules and our way of life. %$* 756
british prime minister tony blair vows to get tougher on terrorists after the london bombings. %$* 116
is the crackdown about more than security? %$* 116
the never-ending story. %$* 116
technically, they may not be presidential candidates, but they're sure acting like '08 contenders in new hampshire. %$* 116
it's a wide open field. %$* 173
any boy or girl who dreamed about becoming president, this may be your time. %$* 173
may the force be with you. %$* 116
a new power in the political wars stars in the "play of the week." %$* 116
now, live from washington, cnn's inside politics. %$* 116
thank you for joining us. %$* 164
i'm candy crowley. %$* 164
we begin with u.s. troops in iraq, the lives lost and the lives still on the line. %$* 164
some 800 marines and sailors now are engaged in operation quick strike, targeting insurgents in western iraq, including the bloodiest battlefield this week, haditha. %$* 164
military officials say the offensive had been in the works before the deadly attacks on haditha monday and wednesday. %$* 164
most of the 20 u.s. troops killed in those attacks were from ohio. %$* 164
and they were honored today at a prayer vigil in cleveland. %$* 164
mayor jane campbell spoke of a community united in grief and pride. %$* 164
we come together and find that even those who may disagree about the government's policy would never for one moment fail to acknowledge the dignity, the courage, and the determination of those who serve and the sacrifice of the families who love them so much. %$* 980
the heartbreak in ohio has only added to those disagreements about u.s. policy in iraq. %$* 164
and that's showing up in president bush's poll numbers. %$* 164
cnn's elaine quijano is with the president in crawford, texas -- elaine? %$* 164
hello to you, candy. %$* 478
that's right. %$* 478
this time last year, president bush was in full campaign mode running as a wartime president and also fending off charges of a sluggish economy. %$* 478
well, now, even though these latest job numbers showing that there is good news on the economic front, there are concerns about how the president is handling the war in iraq. %$* 478
specifically, a new associated press/ipsos poll is out that shows just 38 percent of americans approve of the president's approach; 59 percent say they disapprove. %$* 478
of course, the survey was taken in recent days during an especially bloody week, as you mentioned, for u.s. forces who are in iraq. %$* 478
since sunday, more than two dozen american troops have been killed there. %$* 478
and against that backdrop, president bush, during a joint appearance with the leader of colombia yesterday, reiterated that the united states would stay the course in iraq. %$* 478
and he also pointed to recent comments by osama bin laden's deputy, ayman al-zawahiri, as evidence that iraq is part of the war on terror. %$* 478
now, on that question of the war on terror, which was combined with foreign policy in that associated press poll, 47 percent of americans said they approve of his handling of foreign policy and the war on terror; 51 percent said they disapprove. %$* 478
meantime, taking a look at the president's overall approval rating, which continues to hover below 50 percent, this poll showing the president at 42 percent. %$* 478
now, mr. bush himself, of course, says he does not pay much attention to polls. %$* 478
but, of course, that news on iraq and his poll numbers on iraq, something that people are watching very closely to see what effect, if any, it might have on the midterm congressional elections and even possibly down the line to 2008, the presidential race. %$* 478
now, as for iraq, the bush administration continues to insist that progress is being made on a number of fronts, saying that iraqis are moving ahead in helping to form their new government and also get a permanent constitution. %$* 478
but those images out of iraq, as well as the images here stateside of mourning, certainly seeming to overshadow the administration's message, as evidenced by these latest numbers -- candy? %$* 478
cnn's elaine quijano with the president. %$* 164
thanks, elaine. %$* 164
let's talk more about iraq and the political ramifications with senator bill nelson, democrat of florida, a member of the armed services committee. %$* 164
senator nelson, pretty bluntly, 38 percent approval of the way the president is conducting the war in iraq. %$* 164
can you sustain a war with those kind of numbers? %$* 164
it's tough, candy, but we are in a heck of a mess. %$* 420
we don't have any alternative but to make sure that we stabilize that country. %$* 420
you can argue all day long -- and there is plenty of argument -- about whether or not we should have gone in there in the first place. %$* 420
you can argue all day long about the faulty intelligence that we had, and i was a recipient of some of that faulty intelligence. %$* 420
but now that we're there, the alternative is to turn that country over to the terrorists, to al qaeda. %$* 420
and if they were running that country, sitting on top of all that oil, and then putting pressure on next door neighbor saudi arabia, and if the royal family were to fall, you get the picture. %$* 420
if suddenly the radical elements are in control of a major part of the world's oil supply, that would bring us to a jolting stop. %$* 420
senator, you voted for the resolution of the war on iraq, as i recall. %$* 164
correct me if i'm wrong. %$* 164
are you sorry? %$* 164
candy, not at the time, because, at the time, we were given information that, in fact, there were weapons of mass destruction. %$* 420
this senator was told that saddam had a plan to put drones on ships with biological warfare and drop them off onto east coast u.s. cities. %$* 420
did i think that there was an imminent threat as a result of that information? %$* 420
you bet i did. %$* 420
and also those votes that came were also perceived of whether or not we were voting to support our troops. %$* 420
now it's a different situation. %$* 420
and yet, i think, as i said at the outset, i think we're in a real fix. %$* 420
so, you know, in some ways, because we started a war that you now appear to believe probably should not have been started, knowing what you know now, the rationale is we have to stay in, because otherwise we will have made it worse, is that what you're saying? %$* 164
well, we have to stabilize the country, stabilize them politically, security-wise. %$* 420
and then they will stabilize politically and economically, if they have a chance. %$* 420
and i think they do have a chance. %$* 420
but it's not just us doing it alone. %$* 420
that's one of the great faults that i find, and i think is reflected in some of those low numbers for the president, that we have not reached out to the world. %$* 420
we've made this our war, when, in fact, when we went into afghanistan, when we went into the first gulf war, we had a lot of the world with us. %$* 420
that's not the case now. %$* 420
senator, i have under about 30 seconds, so i want to give one of those horrible questions. %$* 164
on a scale of one to 10, when you look ahead to your reelection bid next year, how high do you think this war in iraq will play in how people make up their minds in florida? %$* 164
i think it will be in the top five. %$* 420
i don't think it will be the deciding factor in my particular race. %$* 420
but i think, clearly, the mood of the country politically is going to be determined about in large part how they feel about iraq. %$* 420
senator bill nelson of florida, as always, we appreciate it. %$* 164
thanks, candy. %$* 420
in britain, tony blair says the rules of the game are changing after the terror attacks in london. %$* 164
coming up, we'll get blair's "get tough" approach. %$* 164
and will it enhance his newfound public support or will it threaten it? %$* 164
also ahead, iraq and the fight for control of congress. %$* 164
will the conflict now make a difference at the polls next year? %$* 164
and the would-be presidential candidates in 2008 may be trying to fly under the radar, but we've got them in our sights. %$* 164
this is inside politics. %$* 164
british prime minister tony blair today proposed new laws to make it easier for his government to deport foreigners who preach hatred and to bar entry to radical clerics. %$* 164
mr. blair said his proposals are not designed to target muslims, only those he described as the "fringe elements" that do not truly represent islam. %$* 164
extremist web sites, bookstores and mosques will also be targeted under the new laws. %$* 164
the prime minister told reporters the country's earlier guidelines for containing extremists in britain no longer apply. %$* 164
if someone is a foreign national coming to preach in this country, they are not going to be preaching this kind of extremism. %$* 756
and if they do, they've just got to understand they're not going to come in. %$* 756
and what i'm trying to do here is -- and this will be followed up with the action in the next few weeks, as i think you will see -- is to send a clear signal out that the rules of the game have changed. %$* 756
a short while ago, i discussed tony blair's proposals with cnn's european political editor, robin oakley. %$* 164
i started by asking robin that, given the signs the event that the recent london bombings have increased political support for blair, how likely is it that today's announcement might threaten that new support? %$* 164
the danger in his new proposals is, firstly, that he's giving only a month's period of consultation on some of the controversial measures. %$* 981
and the conservative leader, or potential conservative leader, is saying that that is not long enough. %$* 981
and the liberal democrat leader, charles kennedy, is saying these measures go too far in terms of compromising britain's civil liberties. %$* 981
and there is a danger, perhaps, that the liberal democrats will start to withdraw some of their support, candy. %$* 981
one of the points the prime minister has made since the bombings is, this will not change our way of life here in britain. %$* 164
with these new proposals, does that still hold true? %$* 164
i don't think it does. %$* 981
the politicians keep insisting that the british are a tolerant people and that they're not going to let their way of life, their liberal values, their openness to different cultures and religions and styles of life, be affected by this. %$* 981
but quite clearly, this is having an effect on the law. %$* 981
tony blair is talking about a changed climate of opinion. %$* 981
he's saying how difficult it was before the last election to get through some anti- terrorist measures. %$* 981
he's saying now the british people, although they retain their tolerance, are angry, and that the government has got to react to that. %$* 981
so we're having, for example, lists drawn up of suspect web sites, bookshops, organizations. %$* 981
and association with any of those is going to be sufficient to make somebody liable for deportation. %$* 981
well, people who are the traditional defenders of civil liberties in britain, i think, are going to find that going too far, candy. %$* 981
and is there a sense that britain has been perhaps too soft in its rules that allow people to come into the country? %$* 164
i think what the government is doing now is virtually an acknowledgement of that. %$* 981
a lot of people have been saying that london had become london-istan, because it was home to so many radical preachers of hate. %$* 981
and people were contrasting the british laid-back style with that in france, for example, where, with their determined secularism, they banned the wearing of muslim headscarves by girls in schools, and so on, and insisted on a much greater integration with french society. %$* 981
now, tony blair is starting to say, yes, ok, we respect people's different culture and religion, but they've got to become part of the british mainstream. %$* 981
that, i think, is an acknowledgement that perhaps not enough has been done to get integration in the past. %$* 981
and a final question on the timing of this. %$* 164
we had heard some of these proposals before from some of your undersecretaries for the prime minister. %$* 164
what's new here? %$* 164
what about the timing of this? %$* 164
the timing of this has a lot to do with the fact that tony blair is about to go on holiday. %$* 981
there had been criticism of the home secretary, the inland security minister, who was about to go on holiday before last big meeting with the police and other security authorities and changed his plans -- criticism that tony blair, his foreign secretary, jack straw, and charles clark, the home secretary, will be away at such a sensitive time. %$* 981
so i think he's wanted to show that he was engaged in these efforts right up to the last minute. %$* 981
there's a bit of political showmanship about this, because nothing will really happen until parliament is back in the autumn. %$* 981
back to u.s. politics after a quick break. %$* 164
some democrats say the situation in iraq could have a political price for republicans. %$* 164
we'll talk about the big races for the house and senate in 2006 when we return. %$* 164
you are looking at a live picture out of the san diego north island naval base where they have finished loading up two rescue vehicles known as super scorpios. %$* 164
this plane, air force c-5, will soon depart and head for the southern tip of the kamchatka peninsula. %$* 164
there, about 625 feet down, are some soviet people aboard a sub. %$* 164
they are stranded down there. %$* 164
the u.s. sending help, trying to rescue them. %$* 164
we have been told that perhaps they have air enough until monday. %$* 164
we have also been told they only have 24 hours left. %$* 164
in any case, a very urgent mission. %$* 164
the u.s. on its way to see what it can do to help those russians stuck in the sub right off the kamchatka peninsula. %$* 164
back to inside politics. %$* 164
the fight for iraq is just one of the factors that could influence next year's congressional elections. %$* 164
with me now to talk about 2006 are two of our favorite analysts, stu rothenberg of the "rothenberg political report", and amy walter of the "cook political report." %$* 164
we have this special election in ohio. %$* 164
we have the first iraq veteran to run. %$* 164
he loses, but not by much. %$* 164
so it's one of things where you lose, it's a victory. %$* 164
is it that iraq was so overwhelming, or are there other things at play? %$* 164
i think there are a lot of other things more important, in terms of the republican candidate and the ineptness of her campaign, the high quality democratic candidate and the strong campaign, a terrific ad at the end of the campaign by the democratic congressional campaign committee, and the environment, which was much more state-focused rather than national-focused, in my mind. %$* 318
bob taft, the governor, a mess. %$* 318
so what do we take from it for -- so what's the lesson learned here, if any? %$* 164
i think what the democratic candidate was able to do so well is he was able to balance being a patriot. %$* 162
and all his ads he ran, he did not run as an anti-war candidate. %$* 162
he ran with pictures of bush in his ads; he ran as a marine. %$* 162
and yet, at the same time, he was able to balance here, also, criticism of the war that helped him raise so much money off the internet. %$* 162
these liberal bloggers say they raised over $500,000 for him. %$* 162
so i think, for frustrated democrats, many of whom who thought the democrats in 2004 did not effectively take advantage of the frustration americans have about the war, these guys are there ready to put money in the campaigns. %$* 162
if candidates can figure out how to keep that balance, there is some money out there for them. %$* 162
and, candy, if you talk to democratic strategists, democratic operatives, they don't talk about iraq as being decisive. %$* 318
they want to talk about ethics, because they think the ethics message has a broad national appeal, certainly a special appeal in ohio, but a broad national appeal to run a change from outsider candidacy. %$* 318
and certainly, on that score, we have some new poll numbers recently showing that, do you think the president is honest?, he has fallen in some of those personal categories that have really sustained him through all of this. %$* 164
how big of trouble are the republicans in at this point? %$* 164
well, remember, for so many of these republicans in congress, it's been a long time since they've had to run in a bad political environment, for republican incumbents, that is. %$* 162
you go back to 2002, obviously had a president with very high approval ratings. %$* 162
congress still had high approval ratings. %$* 162
2004, still, the president was ok. %$* 162
now this safety net that republican candidates have really counted on, especially the president's handling of the war, terrorism, his ability to really play off john kerry in 2004 and those issues, that's not there anymore. %$* 162
and so these candidates are really now kind of on a tightrope without that net. %$* 162
i think you're going to start to see many more republicans starting to distance themselves from the president and doing that through their campaign advertising, we haven't seen yet but i'm sure we will. %$* 162
the way i put it is, conditions are ripe for a democratic wave. %$* 318
if i was the weatherman, we would talk about atmospherics and barometric pressure. %$* 318
conditions are appropriate for that -- bad job approval numbers for the president, more people, many more people, majority of the people believe the country is headed off on the wrong track. %$* 318
however, once we focus on individual races, that changes things. %$* 318
and i did note a democracy corps poll just out within the last day or two. %$* 318
they asked a thermometer, feelings about the parties, 100 to 0; 100, i have a very favorable feeling toward the republicans and the democrats, zero unfavorable. %$* 318
and the parties were about even, almost identical ratings. %$* 318
so while i think the republicans are at risk, i don't think they've, at this point, been dramatically harmed. %$* 318
i mean, i was going to ask -- there's gaining ground and then there's overtaking the republicans for... %$* 164
that's right. %$* 162
and right now, we're talking about the possibility of gaining ground, as far as you can see. %$* 164
and democrats, especially, when it comes to the house, when you have, you know, potentially a bigger universe to go and try to expand into, that's really what they're looking for. %$* 162
and i think the ohio race is one example where they're going to try to expand the playing field, because today we -- both of us can only look at 20, 30 seats that are competitive. %$* 162
democrats need 15 to be able to take control of congress. %$* 162
so they need to be able to expand the field by trying to recruit more candidates, try to take advantage of some of these atmospherics in places where it may be more dramatic than others. %$* 162
ohio is a great example. %$* 162
but you're right. %$* 162
fundamentally, if voters think, "i think the entire system is broken," then they're not necessarily going to award one candidate over the other. %$* 162
i think what we're looking at feels very similar to the early '90s when there was a very strong anti-incumbent message, that both parties suffered. %$* 162
but clearly voters know which party's in charge. %$* 162
and i think running as an outsider in this environment would be a very smart move. %$* 162
and if you're at the democratic senate campaign committee, the congressional campaign committee, you can point to the paul hackett race, but you could also point to these bush numbers and right track-wrong track numbers as you recruit candidates, right, and as you try to raise money to your party. %$* 318
you go out to donors and say, we've got a terrific opportunity. %$* 318
look. %$* 318
give to us. %$* 318
and you go out and recruit the candidates. %$* 318
so i don't want to minimize the short-term environment and the advantages it offers the democrats. %$* 318
let's just -- in term of net seat changes, we have to hold our fire. %$* 318
and plenty of time left for things to change on the ground and all, a couple of months, anyway. %$* 164
so, stu rothenberg of the "rothenberg political report," amy walter of the "cook political report," as always, it's great to talk to you. %$* 164
thanks. %$* 164
if you think presidential campaigns only happen every four years, you probably don't live in iowa or new hampshire. %$* 164
coming up, the endless race, and the men and women who are doing a lot of running, despite saying they're not candidates, at least not yet. %$* 164
plus, a milestone remembered in the march for equality in the election process. %$* 164
more inside politics ahead. %$* 164
markets are getting set to close on wall street. %$* 164
so, of course, you know i am joined by kitty pilgrim in new york with "the dobbs report" -- kitty? %$* 164
hi, candy. %$* 315
how are you? %$* 315
stocks lower. %$* 315
let's take a look. %$* 315
and the dow industrials having a pretty tough day, down about 47. %$* 315
nasdaq 0.5 percent lower. %$* 315
part of this problem, oil prices. %$* 315
they jumped nearly a dollar, closed above $62 a barrel. %$* 315
that's for the first time. %$* 315
let's look at labor. %$* 315
employers hired 207,000 more workers in july. %$* 315
that's the most in five months. %$* 315
also in the report, big jump in wages. %$* 315
that could be bad for inflation. %$* 315
the fed could get more aggressive about interest rates. %$* 315
now, the next fed meeting is on tuesday. %$* 315
it was a big day for baidu.com. %$* 315
what is baidu.com? %$* 315
it's a chinese web search engine. %$* 315
and the shares more than quadrupled on their first day of trading, going from $27 a share to, get this, $127, baidu often called the chinese equivalent of google. %$* 315
in other news, the justice department reportedly investigating claims that daimlerchrysler's mercedes unit paid bribes to foreign officials. %$* 315
the "wall street journal" says the bribes went to at least a dozen countries and that senior executives knew all about it. %$* 315
00 eastern, "lou dobbs tonight," our special series, "broken borders," a massive breakdown in u.s. border security. %$* 483
an illegal alien gets a job with the border patrol, uses his post to smuggle more illegals into the country. %$* 483
if this person was taking about $300 a head to smuggle other illegals into this country, who is to say that a foreign power or islamofascists with access to untold wealth is able to up the ante and bring terrorist cells into this country? %$* 982
also tonight, budgetary magic tricks. %$* 315
congress passed the transportation bill with a price tag of $286 billion. %$* 315
but critics say the real price is much higher. %$* 315
we'll have a full report. %$* 315
plus, astronauts aboard the shuttle discovery getting ready for their journey home. %$* 315
and we have one astronaut -- a veteran of three spacewalks will join us to talk about monday's landing and the future of the shuttle program. %$* 315
also, scientists this week unveiled the first cloned dog. %$* 315
now, is this a scientific breakthrough or an ominous ethical mistake? %$* 315
two professors on opposite sides of the issue join us for a debate. %$* 315
00 eastern, lou dobbs tonight. %$* 414
but for now, back to you, candy. %$* 414
we'll be there, i promise. %$* 164
thanks, kitty. %$* 164
now back to inside politics. %$* 164
every day, every minute, a child is born, someone dies, and a possible presidential contender is testing the waters in iowa or new hampshire. %$* 164
ok, that last part is exaggerated, but you see where we're going. %$* 164
in presidential politics, it's almost always a good idea to campaign early and often, even if you're not officially running for anything. %$* 164
happy birthday to you. %$* 983
it's lou d'allesandro's birthday. %$* 164
who, you may ask, is lou d'allesandro? %$* 164
he's a well-connected longtime democratic state senator from new hampshire. %$* 164
next question, what's john edwards doing here, on his third new hampshire visit since the last election? %$* 164
: are you running for president? %$* 164
no. %$* 984
my campaign is to do something about poverty in this country. %$* 984
not that we actually expected him to say yes. %$* 164
they all know how to avoid that question, or they wouldn't -- they wouldn't have gotten as far as they've gotten in this business. %$* 985
on the same night john edwards was not running for president, joe keefe, another well-connected state democrat, was to host a little fete for john kerry, who is also not running. %$* 164
there was an opportunity to sort of see him in the flesh and reconnect and i think, for john kerry, an opportunity to stay in touch and keep his options open. %$* 985
kerry had senate business, so the party was canceled. %$* 164
but he'll be back to, uh, keep his options open. %$* 164
he's already been back, a month after he lost the '04 election. %$* 164
two thousand and eight? %$* 21
welcome back to new hampshire, land of eternal politics. %$* 164
i think our perception is, it never ends. %$* 986
so it isn't that -- it isn't that early. %$* 986
and, fortunately, they recycle here. %$* 164
well, i ordered it online from the dem store last year. %$* 22
and it didn't get here until after john did not win the primary. %$* 22
so, it's been hanging on a hanger. %$* 22
and i thought, oh, good, i can wear the shirt tonight. %$* 22
it is not just that some presidential suspects are showing up in new hampshire. %$* 164
it's that a lot of them are. %$* 164
let me see. %$* 22
in terms of national figures, senator bayh has been to visit. %$* 22
republicans, just since the first of the year, we've had bill frist up here, senator frist. %$* 173
and we've seen governor richardson from new mexico. %$* 22
we hear that we're going to be seeing governor vilsack shortly. %$* 22
governor romney, senator allen and senator brownback. %$* 173
it's so early that the buzz is more a hum, but the early hum goes to mitt romney, the republican with the movie star looks, and bill richardson, the democrat with the swagger of a rock star. %$* 164
but the sheer volume of candidates speaks to a race that, on both sides, begins on an even playing field, no incumbents, not even a vice president who's interested. %$* 164
it's a wide-open field. %$* 173
any boy or girl who dreamed about becoming president, this may be your time. %$* 173
so, katie, bar the door, or at least the state line. %$* 164
and that goes for iowa, too. %$* 164
in fact, if they all come at once, the 2.9 million iowans better get out of the way. %$* 751
they'll get run over. %$* 751
crowley: exceptions to the even-playing-field, the 800-pound gorillas, hillary clinton, who has yet to visit new hampshire this season, and john mccain, who has dropped in once. %$* 751
of course, i have some very happy memories of my extended stay in your state several years ago. %$* 368
they already have names. %$* 164
they already have networks. %$* 164
there is no rush. %$* 164
there are people willing to hold their places. %$* 164
hillary, can you help us? %$* 987
sure, but it will take me two terms to clean up this mess. %$* 988
for all others, it is show time in new hampshire, working out the bugs, working on the message, just plain working it. %$* 164
edwards and kerry already have paid staffers planted in the state, helping local democrats. %$* 164
most people are here trying to build, build the names, build a network, help somebody out, so that, in turn, you'll be helping someone else out when the time comes. %$* 986
grabbing a chit. %$* 164
right. %$* 986
you got it. %$* 986
you know the game. %$* 986
for the most part, they fly under the radar. %$* 164
but ready or not, the '08 presidential race is under way, no matter what you hear. %$* 164
how often will we see you? %$* 21
well, hopefully, i got to get myself reelected and then we'll see. %$* 989
but i like new hampshire. %$* 989
i'm running for reelection next year in virginia. %$* 488
so, i'm focused on that reelection. %$* 488
no one in new hampshire believes them. %$* 164
no one. %$* 164
do you have any idea who your partner's going to be in the presidential elections? %$* 22
well, i haven't decided what i'm going to do yet. %$* 984
so, no, i haven't gotten that far. %$* 984
not yet. %$* 164
we will be watching the '08 prospects every step of the way, and so will cnn political analyst ron brownstein of the "los angeles times." %$* 164
we missed you up there. %$* 164
but i'll tell you, it's a lot nicer now than in the snow. %$* 164
it is. %$* 320
you're exactly right. %$* 320
that's the benefit of new hampshire. %$* 320
i asked all of them when i was up there, tell me how you gauge whether someone's really running. %$* 164
what are the -- you know, what are the hallmarks? %$* 164
do they have to go to this place? %$* 164
do they have to go to that place? %$* 164
when you look at who's really serious, what do you look at? %$* 164
well, i think, first of all, i mean, you have a lot of people out there who understand they don't have to make a final decision on whether or not to run at this point. %$* 320
and what's really important at this point is to do the things that will enable them to run if they decide to down the road. %$* 320
so, what do you look for? %$* 320
you look for people who are beginning to talk to fund-raising donors outside of their normal network, who are beginning to talk to some of the political consultants in the parties who have done this before. %$* 320
we have a long cast of characters who have been around the block and are beginning to travel. %$* 320
certainly, someone like mitt romney, the governor of massachusetts, has made a number of high-profile trips, speaking to republican audiences, clearly putting himself out for them to measure. %$* 320
that's the kind of activity. %$* 320
it doesn't tell you they're going to run. %$* 320
it tells you they want to have the option of running. %$* 320
what about money? %$* 164
at this point, does the money tell you anything? %$* 164
i noticed that senator bayh, evan bayh, has raised more money than anybody else at this point from a pac. %$* 164
what does that tell you? %$* 164
well, i think, traditionally, really going back at least until the 1980s, about 20 years, establishing a pac for the midterm election is one of the ways that people lay the groundwork for running for president. %$* 320
it funds their own travel. %$* 320
it allows them to acquire ious and chits with candidates by contributing to them. %$* 320
so, that is -- that is one sign. %$* 320
but, again, i -- you know, you can -- you can begin to do this work and get down the road and decide it doesn't work. %$* 320
so, it's not a sure sign that someone is -- is going to run. %$* 320
it's only that they want to have the option of running. %$* 320
in some ways, is what's going on in new hampshire now, and will for the next two years or so, really the fight for who's going to be the insurgent? %$* 164
you know, you heard me talk about the 800- pound gorillas. %$* 164
i mean, these are people that don't really have to be there until the very end. %$* 164
yes. %$* 320
no, there are a lot of different slots in the race, i think, candy, in any race. %$* 320
and i -- i agree with the premise that, because this is an open seat on both sides, without a vice president running, in all likelihood, as far as we know, there will be an enormous amount of politicians who think this is the best chance they're going to have to run. %$* 320
and so, one of the things that's going to be challenging is to get noticed for anybody, whether it's as the insurgent or as a conservative or moderate alternative in either party. %$* 320
there's going to be an enormous challenge for these candidates just to draw attention to themselves in a field that could number 20 on both sides before it narrows down. %$* 320
so, what -- i think what -- you're not only seeing candidates go to new hampshire and iowa and meet some of the early activists, you're seeing them try out the themes and the niches they're hoping to fill when this race gets going full scale. %$* 320
ron brownstein, "l.a. times," thank you very much. %$* 164
pleasure . %$* 320
a leading conservative takes a stand on teaching creation. %$* 164
and senator rick santorum's position may surprise you. %$* 164
also ahead, it's been 40 years since congress delivered voting rights to all americans. %$* 164
we'll look back at that civil rights milestone. %$* 164
and when we go "inside the blogs," what's in a name? %$* 164
the reagan street fight. %$* 164
this is inside politics. %$* 164
checking the "political bytes" on this friday, pennsylvania republican senator rick santorum is breaking with president bush on an issue important to many religious conservatives. %$* 164
santorum tells national public radio that, while he has problems with the concept of evolution, he is not ready for intelligent design to be taught in schools. %$* 164
intelligent design is the idea that a creator, not natural selection, is responsible for the existence of the universe. %$* 164
earlier this week, president bush said he thinks intelligent design should be taught alongside evolution. %$* 164
in santorum's words -- "i'm not comfortable with intelligent design being taught in the science classroom. %$* 164
what we should be teaching are the problems and holes -- and i think there are legitimate problems and holes -- in the theory of evolution. %$* 164
and what we need to do is to present those fairly from a scientific point of view." %$* 164
new jersey senator and gubernatorial candidate jon corzine is drawing criticism from republicans over reports he forgave a loan of almost half-a-million dollars to his ex-girlfriend. %$* 164
the woman, carla katz, also heads the local communications workers of america, which represents 9,000 state employees. %$* 164
corzine says the arrangement would not affect his ability to negotiate with the union were he to be elected governor. %$* 164
and former new jersey governor jim mcgreevey has signed a book deal. %$* 164
mcgreevey, you will recall, resigned from office about a year ago when he announced that he was gay and that he had been involved in an adulterous relationship with a man on his payroll. %$* 164
african-americans going to vote in the south in the 1960s didn't always get as far as the ballot box. %$* 164
the voting rights act largely changed that, making it illegal for minorities to be denied. %$* 164
bruce morton looks at how the act, which turns 40 this weekend, changed politics in the south and the makeup of political parties. %$* 164
in 1960s america, black and white americans marched to make sure southern blacks had the right to vote. %$* 321
it took beatings to make sure southern blacks could vote. %$* 321
in philadelphia, mississippi, three civil rights workers -- two white, one black -- were murdered seeking that right. %$* 321
earlier this summer, 80-year-old ex-klansman edgar ray killen was sentenced to 60 years in prison for the manslaughter of those three young men. %$* 321
and, 40 years ago this weekend, president lyndon johnson signed the voting rights act of 1965. %$* 321
we were black, yes. %$* 122
we were denied, yes. %$* 122
but we were americans. %$* 122
and we had faith that we could make the constitution work. %$* 122
it did. %$* 321
when congress passed the act, there were six blacks among its 435 house members, all from northern cities. %$* 321
today, there are 42. %$* 321
democrat john conyers represented the detroit district then and now. %$* 321
it has worked. %$* 990
and it has done what we wanted it to do. %$* 990
but we also have a few decisions that we have to make that -- we have to correct a few court decisions that have scrambled it up a bit. %$* 990
and that's part of extending the provisions and strengthening the voting rights act of 1965. %$* 990
under the act, certain states and precincts, mostly in the south, must get federal clearance before changing voting procedures, moving a polling place, for instance. %$* 321
localities that have a lot of non-english speakers must provide ballots in other languages. %$* 321
and the federal government can send election examiners to make sure voters aren't frightened away from the polls. %$* 321
the act changed voting. %$* 321
there are still complaints, but not the wholesale disenfranchisement of blacks that existed earlier. %$* 321
and there have been political changes, too, whites switching parties, republicans favoring majority black districts, because they'll gain white votes in the districts adjoining the majority black ones. %$* 321
as blacks became enfranchised and started to participate in large numbers and have an impact on the democratic party, white southerners decided they would look for a different party. %$* 318
and they found one in the republican party. %$* 318
so, the enfranchisement of blacks fundamentally changed over a 20-, 30-year period the political landscape in the south and nationally, as republicans became the dominant party of white southerners. %$* 318
white democrats can still win in the south, but only with black support. %$* 321
john edwards won a north carolina senate seat in 1998 with 41 percent of the white vote, but 91 percent of the black vote, for instance. %$* 321
and extending the act's enforcement provisions, which expire in 2007, that's been controversial in the past. %$* 321
but now, with both parties courting minority votes, it may be very easy. %$* 321
bruce morton, cnn, washington. %$* 321
there is ronald reagan airport and the ronald reagan building. %$* 164
is there room in washington for a ronald reagan boulevard? %$* 164
we'll join our blog reporters next for a commentary on the proposed name change and the online reaction to yesterday's "strategy session." %$* 164
a new effort to honor ronald reagan has bloggers talking. %$* 164
on that, we want to check in with cnn political producer abbi tatton and jacki schechner, our blog reporter -- jacki. %$* 164
hi, candy. %$* 325
well, as the dcist.com puts it -- this a blog that focuses on washington, d.c. -- there are two traditions that they like to make fun of. %$* 325
one is texas politicians trying to make changes in d.c. and the other is trying to name everything in a five-mile radius after ronald reagan. %$* 325
and this came together when congressman henry bonilla proposed the renaming of 16th street, ronald reagan boulevard. %$* 325
they have the details over at dcist. %$* 325
but this has a lot of people up in arms. %$* 325
sixteenth street, you might not know, is a major thoroughfare. %$* 325
it runs right up to the front of the white house. %$* 325
it is the 16 in 1600 pennsylvania avenue. %$* 325
and this local story has obviously got a political side to it. %$* 384
and political bloggers are really weighing in on this one. %$* 384
matt yglesias at tpmcafe.com is picking up on this, him and josh marshall saying this -- this is a stupid idea. %$* 384
yglesias also making the point that isn't it a shame that d.c. people -- d.c. citizens have to possibly rely on a virginia congressman, tom davis, who doesn't like the idea, to bail them out of this one, because they have no representation of their own. %$* 384
but conservatives, too, really not happy about this one. %$* 384
this is "the corner," thenationalreview.com's blogging arm, where lots of people, lots of conservatives weigh in. %$* 384
john podhoretz over there is also saying this is an absolutely stupid idea. %$* 384
"renaming something so familiar is an act of government high-handedness and not something that reagan himself would like." %$* 384
and frank gess  blogging at andrewsullivan.com says that d.c., one of the few places that rejected reagan's reelection, putting out that they are going to continue to force the great leader's name on us until we recant the decision in the '84 election, again, not gaining a lot of support on that one. %$* 325
but there was -- wasn't there something else we were going to talk about? %$* 384
no. %$* 325
we were. %$* 384
there was something yesterday that happened. %$* 384
gosh, what was that? %$* 325
what was that? %$* 384
oh, the novak incident. %$* 325
you didn't think that we were not going to actually talk about it, did you? %$* 325
we are going to. %$* 325
for those of you who don't know, bob novak left the set of this program yesterday after uttering an expletive. %$* 325
he walked off the set. %$* 325
cnn has apologized to its viewers. %$* 325
novak -- mr. novak has apologized to cnn. %$* 325
and cnn has asked him to take some time off. %$* 325
he has agreed to do so. %$* 325
we knew the blogs would pick up on this very, very quickly. %$* 325
they did. %$* 325
as far as we can tell -- this unscientific, now -- but as far as we can tell, the first one to pick it up was eschaton. %$* 325
this is atrios.blogspot.com. %$* 325
also, very quick on the draw on this story was thinkprogress.org. %$* 325
we figured it out. %$* 325
we think that they had it all up within about 10 minutes after it happened. %$* 325
yes, the speed was incredible, and, also, how many people were linking to this story as it came out. %$* 384
one of the first video bloggers to put it up there yesterday was john amato at crooksandliars.com. %$* 384
he actually posted the video in four different places on his site, because he anticipated so many links. %$* 384
and, indeed, he had 100,000 downloads of this story last night, after he put it out there. %$* 384
usually, the entire site gets about 67,000 hits a day. %$* 384
so, quite incredible, the amount of people linking to that. %$* 384
he says -- he tells us, actually, an administrator to his site shut it down very -- just for a few minutes because they were worried that there was some kind of viral attack going on, there was so much traffic at the site yesterday. %$* 384
well, from that video, there's a screen grab that is making the rounds. %$* 325
people are wondering what is on the table between james carville, bob novak and ed henry. %$* 325
and mysterypollster.com, one of the bloggers, has a photograph, one of those screen grabs. %$* 325
and he e-mailed a larger blogger, mickey kaus over at slate. %$* 325
this is slate.msn.com. %$* 325
and what they're wondering is, was it in fact a copy of "who's who" that was on the table? %$* 325
and ed henry, who was doing the interview yesterday with robert novak before he left the set, confirms, yes, there was a "who's who" on the table yesterday. %$* 384
henry had wanted to ask the question whether he got plame's name from there, from the "who's who" or from karl rove. %$* 384
he anticipated asking that question at the end of the segment. %$* 384
incidentally, he tells us there was also a "who's who" on the table in an earlier segment that week, on tuesday, when he planned to do the same interview with novak. %$* 384
but that was preempted due to breaking news. %$* 384
so, bloggers are asking, is this the reason that robert novak asked -- left the set at that time? %$* 384
that's something for them to speculate. %$* 384
that's not something i do. %$* 384
well, one of the things we do know is how fast they can get their hands on reference information. %$* 325
and wizbangblog.com has a scanned-in copy of that entry from "who's who" for joseph wilson. %$* 325
you can take a look at that. %$* 325
valerie plame's name is, in fact, in that entry. %$* 325
wizbangblog.com, we should also point out, is the blog that has made a point that it is august in washington, candy, and this is what makes news. %$* 325
we will send it back to you. %$* 325
gee, thanks a lot. %$* 164
talk to you later. %$* 164
the web played a role in another political story this week. %$* 164
our senior political analyst, bill schneider, is with me now -- bill. %$* 164
netroots activism. %$* 317
ever hear of it? %$* 317
you will, because this week marks its arrival as a force in american politics. %$* 317
it can even claim the "political play of the week." %$* 317
the blogosphere is supposed to be the realm of anarchy. %$* 386
bloggers are said to be fierce individualists, spouting off online, sitting in the park, alone, like bob brigham here. %$* 386
he and his partner, tim tagaris, run a democratic blog called swingstateproject.com. %$* 386
brigham is in san francisco. %$* 386
tagaris is in ohio. %$* 386
they never met until this year, when they discovered a cause -- more precisely, a candidate -- democrat paul hackett, running in a special election for an ohio congressional seat, a seat that most national democrats wrote off as hopeless. %$* 386
but hackett, a marine who served in iraq, showed fight. %$* 386
and we got to say it loud, that we are proud to fight for what this great country stands for. %$* 496
the liberal blogs got organized. %$* 317
one hundred, 150 bloggers helped raise money, turned out volunteers, got people down to the district, and e-mailed their friends in ohio. %$* 991
ever hear of a blog swarm? %$* 317
this was actually indicative of a pretty decent blog swarm. %$* 325
this was a pretty decent example of a lot of people getting behind one thing at the exact same time. %$* 325
the bloggers raised a lot more money for the hackett campaign than the democratic congressional campaign committee. %$* 317
we raised around $550,000 from the netroots, which means we outspent the national republican congressional committee and were three times as relevant as the democratic congressional campaign committee in terms of cold, hard cash. %$* 991
and, on the final day of the campaign: %$* 317
they needed $30,000. %$* 325
so, bob from swingstate sent out an e-mail, made phone calls that, here's what we need. %$* 325
we need $30,000 in a very short period of time. %$* 325
and actblue the next day delivered a check for $60,000. %$* 325
actblue, that's a web site that raises money for democrats. %$* 317
in the end, hackett lost, but he came a whole lot closer than washington pros expected him to. %$* 317
this was a success. %$* 496
we should all be proud. %$* 496
so, let's rock on. %$* 496
people often compare the internet to the wild west. %$* 317
here's an update. %$* 317
the lone gun slingers of the blogosphere could work as a posse. %$* 991
and that is what let us raise an army. %$* 991
and carry off the "political play of the week." %$* 317
the bloggers made their point on their web site, of course -- and i quote -- "the republican party," they write, "is on notice. %$* 317
for that matter, so is the democratic party establishment on notice. %$* 317
get with the program or we'll leave you behind." %$* 317
so, there. %$* 317
all righty, then. %$* 164
bill schneider, thanks very much. %$* 164
our "strategy session" is straight ahead on inside politics. %$* 164
a bloody week for american troops in iraq. %$* 164
we will discuss new poll numbers showing a sharp drop in the american public support for president bush's war policies. %$* 164
welcome back to inside politics and our "strategy session" on today's hottest political topics. %$* 164
with us today, democratic strategist steve mcmahon and cnn contributor bay buchanan. %$* 164
today's topics, political war. %$* 164
a deadly week for american troops in iraq and new poll numbers on how president bush is handling the fight for iraq. %$* 164
fighting terror. %$* 164
british prime minister tony blair's tough new anti-terror measures take aim at those who preach hate. %$* 164
and judging judge roberts. %$* 164
conservatives react to supreme court nominee john roberts' past work for gay activists. %$* 164
first up, a new associated press/ipsos poll shows public support for president bush's handling of the war in iraq has dropped to 38 percent. %$* 164
that is the lowest since mr. bush ordered the u.s.-led invasion in march of 2003. %$* 164
this week alone, 28 american troops have been killed in iraq, raising the total death toll to more than 1,800. %$* 164
president bush said that, despite the american deaths, the u.s. will stay the course. %$* 164
at the same time, a combined american-iraqi offensive is under way in an insurgent hotbed in western iraq. %$* 164
pretend you're the white house. %$* 164
i think it's awfully difficult to sustain a war at 38 percent approval of it. %$* 164
what do you do to turn those numbers around? %$* 164
well, the first thing is, there's no question there's an enormous uneasiness in this country about this war. %$* 422
they don't see an end. %$* 422
and you see the death toll this week alone is 21. %$* 422
you saw what happened out there in ohio. %$* 422
i mean, an anti-war democrat in a strictly republican district did extraordinarily well, almost beat the fellow. %$* 422
so there's obviously this uneasiness. %$* 422
it's not just democratic; it's republicans. %$* 422
it's across the board. %$* 422
and the white house, i think, has got to hope that they can hold on to some support out there and start moving our troops home after the constitution has passed and we have a government over there. %$* 422
what do you do? %$* 164
just pretend you're advising the president at this point. %$* 164
he's got a problem. %$* 164
yes. %$* 992
well, i think one of the things he might consider doing is leaving crawford, texas, and going to cleveland where there's a memorial service for 16 soldiers who died. %$* 992
perhaps he could explain to their parents and the people of ohio why their sacrifice was worth it. %$* 992
i mean, that is the state that delivered the presidency to him. %$* 992
and, you know, this is a war that he supports. %$* 992
he wants to stay the course. %$* 992
and he's going to have to get out there and defend it, i think, a little bit more aggressively. %$* 992
there's no question... %$* 422
it's not going to probably be enough to just stand there at a lectern in crawford in the middle of your vacation and say, we're going to stay the course. %$* 992
i think he's going to have to be a little more aggressive. %$* 992
he's going to have to use the bully pulpit. %$* 422
there's no question. %$* 422
i agree entirely. %$* 422
but he should not go to any funerals. %$* 422
these are private affairs of the family. %$* 422
it just makes it a big hoopla media circus. %$* 422
you don't do that. %$* 422
you make certain that they have their private time to mourn, but to talk to them personally and also to give some type of a speech to talk to the american people and let them know, by the way, we're going to do this. %$* 422
we've got the constitution we're looking at. %$* 422
we've got this government. %$* 422
and we hope that, by next spring, we're bringing them home. %$* 422
and if i could just interrupt, didn't he give a speech? %$* 164
didn't we just hear a speech? %$* 164
we did, and it hasn't worked. %$* 422
there's an uneasiness. %$* 422
they need to know what is happening. %$* 422
and they need to know how we're getting home. %$* 422
there's no light at the end of this tunnel for americans right now. %$* 422
they just see us in there. %$* 422
they see our people dying. %$* 422
they see insurgents continuing to be successful. %$* 422
how does he balance that, though? %$* 164
because you can't, like, signal to the insurgents, by the way, we're leaving. %$* 164
and yet he has to tell the american people, listen, by the way, we're leaving. %$* 164
well, and bay's right. %$* 992
he absolutely has to. %$* 992
i mean, one of the problems i think that the administration has had with this war from the beginning is that we went in for a reason that was -- that turned out to be false. %$* 992
we went in to rid the country of weapons of mass destruction. %$* 992
it later became, you know, regime change, which we've now accomplished, and we're still there. %$* 992
and then at some point, you know, he tried to turn it into the war on terror, which i think is responsible, in some measure, for the numbers that he's looking at today. %$* 992
the american people have figured out that we didn't go in there for a very good reason. %$* 992
they've figured out that they weren't told the truth about why we were going in. %$* 992
and they figured out, i think, that the president doesn't seem to have a plan to get us out of there. %$* 992
he needs to come up with one. %$* 992
he needs to articulate it. %$* 992
and he needs to use the bully pulpit to build some support. %$* 992
and, candy, 30,000 troops come home in february. %$* 422
people are going to start relaxing. %$* 422
they'll feel a little more comfortable. %$* 422
but, again, he'll have the problem of, what's going to happen once we leave? %$* 422
now, let me -- i wanted you to look at this honesty poll. %$* 164
do you think the president's honest? %$* 164
it's gone from 53 to 48. %$* 164
it has dropped under 50 percent in our latest poll. %$* 164
now, you know, the problem with that is, isn't it that anything he says now is certainly looked at under the cloak of most people thinking he's not honest? %$* 164
well, in my opinion, the number, that particular number, is the worst news for the president in this poll, because it goes to a character dimension and that is a very, very difficult one to change. %$* 992
the american public, first of all, gives the president enormous benefit of the doubt. %$* 992
and it's difficult to get them to the point where they don't think you're honest. %$* 992
secondly, it's a character judgment that they're making about him that has nothing to do with the performance of the war. %$* 992
so, for instance, you can have a policy disagreement about how the war's being engaged and fought, and he can change that and perhaps change the number on the approval of his performance in iraq. %$* 992
it's very hard to change character-based numbers once they get to this point. %$* 992
this is real trouble, there's no question. %$* 422
and how does he get out of it? %$* 422
he's got to start acting. %$* 422
you know, he keeps talking about the economy's doing well, and these trade agreements are going to be great, and whatever other bill is going to help us. %$* 422
and the people feel uneasy about that. %$* 422
they're worried about their jobs. %$* 422
they're concerned. %$* 422
they don't see the benefits what he's talking about. %$* 422
and so, as a result, they stop believing him. %$* 422
he talks about the war on terror and how concerned we are, and they see an open border. %$* 422
and they say, well, how can you be real serious? %$* 422
the border's open. %$* 422
are we serious about this? %$* 422
they're ready for action. %$* 422
there's uneasiness in this country, and it's growing. %$* 422
and he'd best take some real action to show he's in charge. %$* 422
he's the commander-in-chief. %$* 422
we have plans here. %$* 422
we're going in the right direction, and here they are. %$* 422
let me ask you to stand by. %$* 164
we'll be right back. %$* 164
britain's prime minister getting tough in the face of threats against his nation. %$* 164
when the "strategy session" continues, we'll examine tony blair's proposed steps to combat terrorism and crack down on foreigners who preach hate. %$* 164
our "strategy session" continues on inside politics. %$* 164
with us today, still, democratic strategist steve mcmahon and cnn contributor bay buchanan. %$* 164
british prime minister tony blair today proposed strict anti- terror measures aimed especially at foreign extremists. %$* 164
the steps would allow the government to expel foreigners who preach hatred, close extremist mosques, and bar entry to muslim radicals. %$* 164
the move follows last month's terrorist bombings and attempted bombings that killed 56 people. %$* 164
at least three of the four men in custody for allegedly carrying out the failed attacks were immigrants from east africa. %$* 164
mr. blair said the british people are angry about extremism and about what extremists are doing to his country. %$* 164
we welcome people here who are peaceful and law-abiding. %$* 756
people who want to be british citizens should share our values and our way of life. %$* 756
but if you come to our country from abroad, don't meddle in extremism, because if you meddle in it, or get engaged in it, you're going to go back out again. %$* 756
well, they're going to identify extremist web sites, extremist bookstores. %$* 164
if you go to any of them, then the police can be looking at you. %$* 164
we're sort of out-patrioting the patriot act, it seems to me, here. %$* 164
yes. %$* 992
it does seem that way. %$* 992
i mean, it's pretty easy in a climate that probably exists right now in england to promote and pass these kind of measures. %$* 992
the only thing i would suggest that they be mindful of is our experience with the patriot act, where it was passed shortly after 9/11. %$* 992
there were a lot of good reasons for doing a lot of the things that were included in the patriot act, but there are a lot of people now who think it might have gone just a little bit too far. %$* 992
except for they renewed it. %$* 164
we did. %$* 422
and there's reason, because our law enforcement officers did not abuse the patriot act. %$* 422
they understand the importance of it; they understand how it should be used. %$* 422
and that's how they're implementing it. %$* 422
so the american people continue to support it. %$* 422
what tony blair is doing is exactly the right thing. %$* 422
you have a country that's unnerved by what's happening. %$* 422
you have places blowing up. %$* 422
people are changing their way of life. %$* 422
he has to bring calm. %$* 422
he has to show that he's the commander-in-chief there. %$* 422
he's taking tough action. %$* 422
and that's the message that our president has to do the same thing. %$* 422
where's our tough action? %$* 422
we do have a patriot act. %$* 422
but look what's happening in new york. %$* 422
well, i was just going to say, fine, so new york says, we're going to randomly search backpacks as they go in, and what happens? %$* 164
they have a lawsuit by the new york civil liberties union saying, you know, it's non-constitutional and it's not effective. %$* 164
on the constitutional part, it is constitutional, if it's properly implemented. %$* 422
it's been shown in the courts. %$* 422
however, i happen to agree with him on one point, it's not effective. %$* 422
they're taking every fifth person on some randomly checked subway spots. %$* 422
if you don't want to be checked, you say, fine. %$* 422
you walk away, and go down another place. %$* 422
it is ridiculous. %$* 422
and just like in england, what did they say in england? %$* 422
we don't have the troops to check everyone. %$* 422
we're not checking little, old, white ladies. %$* 422
they happen not to blow themselves up in trains. %$* 422
steve, we're talking about profiling. %$* 164
that's what we need to do, profiling, exactly what we need to do. %$* 422
well, bay's talking about profiling. %$* 992
i thought -- i'm talking about little, white ladies. %$* 992
listen, i think that, you know, i sort of part company with the new york aclu on this particular matter. %$* 992
i mean, obviously, when you have trains being blown up in england, it's prudent and it's responsible to try to do what you can to prevent those things from happening here. %$* 992
i mean, the alternative, of course, is to just say to everybody -- what the airlines have done -- you know, you're going to go through a metal detector, or something like that, which i think would be fine, but i think people probably prefer this to that. %$* 992
i don't think there's an easy answer and i don't think there's necessarily a perfect answer. %$* 992
but racial profiling is problematic for a number of reasons. %$* 992
obviously, when terrorism is potentially involved, it's a totally different question. %$* 992
but it's prone to abuse. %$* 992
and our experience in this country has been that abuse has been more common than, i think, most people believe it should have been. %$* 992
but when it's abused, we will take appropriate actions. %$* 422
but in the meantime, it could be an effective way to stop any kind of an event like this, or at least hopefully stop an event such as this. %$* 422
the key here is -- i believe that it is wrong to just randomly check people, if it is not an effective means, because all you're doing is the elected officials are saying, look -- look, we've all  done. %$* 422
the mayor says, look, i've really been responsible. %$* 422
he's not being responsible. %$* 422
he's being so cautious. %$* 422
he's afraid to be politically incorrect. %$* 422
but when you're at war, you move aside politically incorrect and you do what do to catch those bad guys who want to do harm to our american citizens. %$* 422
but, bay, we've been doing random checks on airlines now since september 11th. %$* 992
and we've kept the terrorists off the airlines, or at least we've stopped more planes from being flown into buildings. %$* 992
so some of this stuff is working. %$* 992
it doesn't necessarily have to be racial profiling. %$* 992
i do think, you know, stopping and frisking 90- year-old white women probably isn't the most productive use of law enforcement. %$* 992
i think most americans would agree. %$* 992
but, you know, there's a long way between there and racial profiling. %$* 992
and we just have to find... %$* 992
eighteen- to twenty-five-year-old males seems to be a good place to start. %$* 422
and if you include 18- to 25-year-old white males, i think it's fine. %$* 992
why? %$* 422
listen, we have profiling every day in this country. %$* 992
and i don't think there probably are a lot, all joking aside, of officers stopping 90-year-old white women. %$* 992
but as long as, you know... %$* 992
i was going to say, twice in the last month. %$* 422
and i was traveling with a congressman. %$* 422
but you're not 90. %$* 992
bay, come on. %$* 992
wait a minute. %$* 422
exactly. %$* 422
do i look like somebody who's going to blow up the plane, for gosh sakes? %$* 422
well, bay... %$* 992
let me ask you to stop here. %$* 164
we'll be right back. %$* 164
... you are a buchanan. %$* 992
another big surprise from the files of supreme court nominee john roberts. %$* 164
when the "strategy session" continues, we'll discuss roberts' involvement in a gay rights case and the reaction from republicans. %$* 164
i'm wolf blitzer, reporting from washington. %$* 142
coming up at the top of the hour, stung by a series of bloody insurgent attacks, u.s. and iraqi troops launching a new military offensive. %$* 142
the crew of a russian mini-submarine remains trapped 625 feet below the surface of the pacific ocean. %$* 142
we'll have the latest on the rescue effort. %$* 142
and it's been almost a year since then-new jersey governor james mcgreevey announced he's gay. %$* 142
now he's writing a book about it. %$* 142
all those stories, much more, only minutes away on wolf blitzer reports. %$* 142
now back to inside politics. %$* 142
the "strategy session" continues on inside politics. %$* 164
with us, democratic strategist steve mcmahon and cnn contributor bay buchanan. %$* 164
virtually every day, new, intriguing information spills out on the files of supreme court nominee john roberts -- ane of the latest, his work in the mid-'90s, as a private attorney, for gay rights activists. %$* 164
according to lawyers involved, roberts' expertise helped them win a landmark ruling protecting gay men and lesbians from state- sanctioned discrimination. %$* 164
roberts' helping hand was pro-bono, but he didn't disclose his role in the case to members of the senate judiciary committee who had asked about such activity in a questionnaire. %$* 164
when the "la times" first broke the story, the white house scrambled to reassure roberts' conservative backers. %$* 164
but not all apparently have been convinced, and the news triggered a flood of angry calls to conservative talk radio shows. %$* 164
i don't know. %$* 164
i suspect this should help him on one side, right? %$* 164
if this had been a strategy, it would have been a really smart one. %$* 992
but unfortunately for the white house, i suspect it was a mistake and not a strategy. %$* 992
i mean, think about it. %$* 992
the guy comes out. %$* 992
he's supported by all the groups on the right. %$* 992
you know, he was acclaimed as the answer. %$* 992
and now this comes out, and, frankly, it's the best thing i've heard about him. %$* 992
and i think it does indicate to some liberals that the guy may have an open mind. %$* 992
it's meaningless. %$* 422
what he did was work in the background. %$* 422
he did not go -- he was not there in the court, did not take the case himself. %$* 422
he just helped them to define which direction they should go in. %$* 422
the key question is, did he agree with the decision? %$* 422
and it is not to say that, because of the work he did, he agreed with the decision. %$* 422
i think the decision was an outrageous one. %$* 422
and that's what we have to know, is whether he agreed with them. %$* 422
i suspect he did not. %$* 422
it was pure activism on the court. %$* 422
he's opposed to that. %$* 422
but think about it. %$* 992
but leaving aside for a second that you've probably -- you know, you think he's a great choice for the supreme court, leaving that aside, as a strategic matter, to have a little bit of carping from the right and a little bit of carping from the left is probably not such a bad thing, if you're trying to demonstrate to the country that you're a mainstream jurist. %$* 992
let me ask you a journalism question. %$* 164
this is off of a press release from kay bailey hutchison, the senator from texas, who, in fact, has adopted children. %$* 164
and she is reacting to the fact that the "new york times" apparently started at least a preliminary look into the adoption process. %$* 164
and she wrote in her press release that, in fact, that she thought this was way over the boundary and that they shouldn't be looking at that. %$* 164
and she talked about -- she said, "in my view, this inquiry by the 'times,' no matter how preliminary the newspaper now says it was, steps over the boundary line. %$* 164
i note the paper initially claimed this misstep was inadvertent, but it has now been reported that the newspaper consulted its lawyers to determine ways to unseal court adoption records of the roberts family. %$* 164
in my view, this is reprehensible." %$* 164
outrageous. %$* 422
utterly outrageous. %$* 422
it just shows how very low the media will go today to -- it's just there's no justification to looking into adoption papers whatsoever. %$* 422
they're criticizing the way they dress their children. %$* 422
they criticized how often... %$* 422
not in the "new york times," i mean... %$* 164
... but the media itself. %$* 422
and then they criticized -- they're talking about how often the wife goes to church. %$* 422
and now they're looking into the adoption. %$* 422
it's outrageous. %$* 422
well, listen, i think it's in the gray area. %$* 992
gray? %$* 422
but i also think that this is a man... %$* 992
gray? %$* 422
mcmahon: well, bay, this is a man who's potentially going to be there for 40 years. %$* 422
it's one of the most powerful positions in the government. %$* 422
and you know, if this were a presidential candidate, all these things would be absolutely routine. %$* 422
he's not a presidential candidate. %$* 422
on the other hand, he's not a private figure, either. %$* 422
so... %$* 422
what about those records that you believe should not become public, which are very private, that should become public suddenly? %$* 422
what is it that you all are looking at? %$* 422
what is it that they would be looking it? %$* 422
i'd presume that those would be turned over to the senate judiciary committee. %$* 992
it would become part of the record, in any event. %$* 992
so i mean, i don't believe that this person was nominated with the belief that people weren't going to go snooping through his background. %$* 992
i mean, we know so little about him that... %$* 992
let me just ask you, because we've got 30 seconds. %$* 164
really, you think that, if there were a presidential nominee, and he had children that he had adopted, that those court records should be opened up? %$* 164
i don't know. %$* 992
but i think that this would be something that newspaper and other journalists would be interested in finding out. %$* 992
and i think that, you know, if they had the opportunity to get it opened up, they would pursue it. %$* 992
absolutely over the line, whether he's presidential, or he's running for office, or whether he wants to be a judge, over the line. %$* 422
bay buchanan, steve mcmahon, thank you so much. %$* 164
we appreciate it. %$* 164
thank you. %$* 992
inside politics will be right back. %$* 164
there will be no more fishing for george bush now as he gears up for the gop convention. %$* 8
we'll talk with the pundits about his options. %$* 8
that's all ahead on inside politics '88. %$* 8
this is inside politics '88, with mary alice williams in new york and, in atlanta, bernard shaw. %$* 116
that was then. %$* 164
vice president george herbert walker bush was running for president. %$* 164
this is now. %$* 164
his son, george w. bush, serving his second term as president. %$* 164
inside politics has covered a lot of amazing political stories over these many years. %$* 164
among the most memorable, the wild three-way battle that was the 1992 race for the white house, the impeachment of president bill clinton, and that 2000 florida recount. %$* 164
00 p.m. eastern. %$* 759
wolf joins us now with some more details. %$* 759
we're going to spend a lot of time on politics, candy. %$* 142
we're not going to shortchange the political scene here in washington, around the country, indeed, around the world, by any means, especially during that 4:00 hour, when our viewers have become so used -- are so reliant on cnn for getting the inside political story. %$* 142
they're still going to get it. %$* 142
they might even get a lot more of it, depending on what that political story is. %$* 142
so the good news is that cnn's commitment to covering the world of politics here in the nation's capital, around the country, that commitment is rock solid. %$* 142
so give us a larger view of all the three hours. %$* 164
what we're going to do -- all three hours will be part of the situation room. %$* 142
and we'll take our viewers in, show the viewers what's happening. %$* 142
our commitment, first and foremost, is to getting the news, getting it on the air as quickly and as responsibly as we can. %$* 142
00 hour, we'll devote a lot of attention to the whole world of security, whether national security, homeland security, personal security, our economic security, all of that will go in. %$* 993
00 hour is going to be a lot of politics. %$* 994
00 hour we're going to talk about what has happened on this day. %$* 995
it's going to be a new way of bringing the news. %$* 995
and we've been rehearsing, and we've been practicing. %$* 995
and you, candy crowley, and all of our political team, will be directly involved, very aggressively. %$* 995
in fact, i'm told we'll see you monday. %$* 164
i'll see you monday. %$* 142
thanks very much. %$* 164
thanks, candy. %$* 142
thanks, wolf. %$* 164
it is now time to say goodbye to inside politics. %$* 164
i am candy crowley. %$* 164
and wolf blitzer reports starts right now. %$* 164

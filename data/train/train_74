the trump team takes shape but not without controversy. %$* 169
we got a great number of men and women, great qualifications. %$* 125
as long as the champion of racial division steps away from to oval office, it will impossible to take trump's efforts to heal the nation seriously. %$* 298
while in washington, the republican party, all smiles. %$* 169
welcome to the dawn of a new, unified republican government. %$* 225
but words of caution from the current commander-in-chief. %$* 169
now comes the hard part. %$* 40
now is governance. %$* 40
and democrats look to regroup, while hillary clinton looks back. %$* 169
the divisions laid bare by this election run deep. %$* 149
america is worth it. %$* 149
inside politics, the biggest stories sourced by the best reporters, now. %$* 169
welcome to inside politics. %$* 169
i'm john berman, in for john king. %$* 169
thanks for sharing your sunday morning with us. %$* 169
exactly two months from today, president-elect donald trump will become president donald trump. %$* 169
much to do before then, much to talk about. %$* 169
though one person who was uncharacteristically not talking at least publicly about things other than broadway musicals, donald trump. %$* 169
he's been fairly camera shy as he puts together his administration. %$* 169
but there was this photo-op, a once near impossible to conceive photo- op with mitt romney, the 2012 republican nominee and former harsh personal critic of donald trump. %$* 169
the two met for about 90 minutes at trump's bedminster, new jersey resort. %$* 169
we had a far reaching conversation with regards to the various theaters in the world where there are interests of the united states of real significance. %$* 214
very thorough and in-depth discussion in the time we had. %$* 214
and appreciate the chance to speak with the president-elect and look forward to the coming administration. %$* 214
close scrutiny this morning on the president-elect's meetings and also his actual cabinet and staff picks. %$* 169
there's no question they made some waves. %$* 169
he appointed a man seen as a champion of white supremacy as a number one strategist in the white house. %$* 298
number one. %$* 298
instead of hiding behind your twitter account and show america that racism, bullying, and bigotry have no place in the white house or in america. %$* 298
on the other side of the aisle, kinder words for a different trump pick. %$* 78
i'm particularly pleased to offer words of congratulations to my colleague and good friend jeff sessions who is going to make an extraordinary attorney general of the united states. %$* 228
he is a committed and deeply principled conservative. %$* 228
here to share their insights and reporting: from real clear politics, caitlin huey-burns, errol louis of spectrum news, "the washington post's" philip bump, and maggie haberman of "the new york times". %$* 169
guys, let's review the president-elect's picks so far. %$* 169
reince priebus tapped as chief of staff, steve bannon, chief strategist and senior counsel, retired general michael flynn for national security adviser, alabama senator jeff sessions for attorney general, and republican congressman mike pompeo to be cia director. %$* 169
that's who is in or at least tapped. %$* 169
so, let's talk now about who is floating and no one is floating more surprisingly than mitt romney. %$* 169
depends who you talk to. %$* 467
there's a divide within trump land, certainly among aides. %$* 467
it is not clear whether romney actually wants it. %$* 467
knowing romney and knowing how he feels about service, i believe if he were offered it, he would think about it pretty hard and there's a real chance he would say yes. %$* 467
but mostly what it reflects is giuliani has fallen out of favor to a large degree. %$* 467
it doesn't mean he won get it. %$* 467
trump is incredibly mercurial in terms of secretary of state. %$* 467
that's the one job that giuliani really wants. %$* 467
but trump became very aggravated by several accounts from people i've spoken to about all the headlines that rudy giuliani was getting, both in terms of the negative ones about his business and his dealings with foreign governments, but also the ones just about giuliani, you know, as the lone real choice. %$* 467
and mayor giuliani was privately telling people it was basically his. %$* 467
trump doesn't like that kind of thing. %$* 467
interesting. %$* 169
so, mitt romney says as much about rudy giuliani as he might about mitt romney. %$* 169
what it all says a lot about is that for trump, we've all heard it for two years about how loyalty is everything to trump. %$* 144
loyalty is everything until it isn't for trump. %$* 144
and so, you know, giuliani was really the last man standing with trump in a lot of ways in those final weeks, and yet he's still going through this meat grinder. %$* 144
and just to review why it's so surprising to so many that mitt romney sat down for so long with rudy giuliani yesterday, let's just reminisce for a moment about the back and forth between two men over the last 12 months. %$* 169
donald trump is a phony, a fraud. %$* 214
mitt was a disaster as a candidate. %$* 5
he's playing the members of the american public for suckers. %$* 214
romney let us all down. %$* 5
he was a very poor campaigner. %$* 5
he gets a free ride to the white house and all we get is a lousy hat. %$* 214
romney choked like a dog. %$* 5
he choked. %$* 5
he went -- %$* 5
his promises are as worthless as a degree from trump university. %$* 214
he was begging for my endorsement. %$* 5
i could have said, mitt, drop to your knees. %$* 5
he would have dropped to his knees. %$* 5
again, you know, even after covering many elections, i find that be more direct and personal than most back and forths, phil, that we've heard between people in campaigns before. %$* 169
but the other side of that is this is donald trump reaching out to former political enemies, bringing them in at least into the room to have a discussion and there's nothing wrong with that. %$* 169
no, there's nothing wrong with that. %$* 57
i mean, i will say that if mitt romney is trying to make a case how he can negotiate with difficult enemies, what we saw yesterday is a good step towards that, right? %$* 57
i mean, this is a position that mitt romney probably never expected himself to be in, having to deal with president-elect trump particularly in the role he's playing there. %$* 57
but, yes, i mean, i think there are a lot of question marks that hang over this entire process. %$* 57
donald trump very much enjoys having a lot of question marks over the entire process. %$* 57
but that said, donald trump needs have the republican establishment working with him. %$* 57
his attitude so far with his former enemies has been to let them come to him and he's doing some of that. %$* 57
but i this interaction with him and romney is a big step forward for establishing a sort of normal relationship between a president and his party. %$* 57
at least have a seat at the table in bedminster or trump tower, as the case maybe. %$* 169
some table. %$* 144
maybe even the white house. %$* 57
some table. %$* 169
errol louis, i want to talk about the other jobs still to fill, secretary of defense, homeland security, education, and some of the things being floated. %$* 169
you know, retired marine general james mattis right now. %$* 169
donald trump had nice things to say about him. %$* 169
a lot of people think he can end up as secretary of defense. %$* 169
michele rhee, he's sort of an education icon or a villain, but at least a notable education figure in there for meetings yesterday. %$* 169
what do these picks say about donald trump? %$* 169
it says that he's going to have a very combative administration. %$* 347
you go person by person, actually, you know, starting with that bannon and right on down the line, with the sole exception of reince priebus, you've got people who have built in constituencies who are organized to try and fight against them, whether it's marching in the streets, or issuing policy papers or otherwise, really kind of going toe to toe. %$* 347
this is in my opinion, a sign that he's not really looking to do all that much compromising when it comes to sort of the core issues that he wants to fight about. %$* 347
and keep in mind, these are not people who will build the wall. %$* 347
you know, these are not necessarily that folks who are going to do the sort of must-do propositions that he laid on the table during the campaign. %$* 347
this is every step of the way. %$* 347
i mean, he mentioned common core maybe a handle of times but no real sort of k-through-12 detailed plan. %$* 347
you put michele rhee there, she's got a detailed plan. %$* 347
she's got a lot of people who -- heads the union in particular who are ready to fight with her. %$* 347
and donald trump is signaling, as far as i can tell, that he's ready to have that fight. %$* 347
but notable, i mean, michele rhee, not to get too much into the weed, she supports common core and donald trump was clear he does not. %$* 169
so, there would be a difference in educational opinion. %$* 169
caitlin, elizabeth warren on twitter talking about, well, talking specifically about the mitt romney meeting, but more globally about the types of people that donald trump has picked so far. %$* 169
this was a tweet from elizabeth warren, "governor mitt romney, when you're meeting with donald trump, maybe you can bring your binders full of women with you." %$* 169
so, that's elizabeth warren being elizabeth warren. %$* 169
you're needling donald trump on twitter. %$* 169
but the fact of the matter is we have five picks from donald trump so far. %$* 169
all five are white men. %$* 169
right. %$* 631
that's problematic for this administration, showing no signs yet of changing that dynamic. %$* 631
my question going forward with some of these picks are, this round announced on friday, was this indicative of what's to come or is this, you know, getting out the kind of the usual suspects of people that we kind of anticipated coming into this administration, putting them out first in order to appease the base, appease his supporters and say this is the direction i'm going while also kind of easing perhaps some of the more unconventional picks. %$* 631
the thing about the trump administration, though, is trump does reward loyalty. %$* 631
but that group is still very small. %$* 631
he's going to have to reach out to people that weren't with him from the beginning. %$* 631
and so, i think that's what a lot of people are watching. %$* 631
so, caitlin raised the question, maggie. %$* 169
i wonder if you have a stab at the answer, what does this say about how trump will govern and who he will surround himself with and the future picks, the five that we've seen so far and the other people he's bringing in? %$* 169
there's not -- i mean, i agree that i think that the meeting with mitt romney definitely signaled something different than what we've seen. %$* 144
but mitt romney still went to trump. %$* 144
i mean, for all the staunch opposition we heard from romney earlier this year and romney is a big believer in protocol, he still went to see the president-elect. %$* 144
so far, we're not seeing any names that we haven't expected with the exception of mike pompeo who had not met with trump until last week. %$* 144
he had prepped the vice president-elect during the debates. %$* 144
he's a favorite of the koch world, which is a really important thing. %$* 144
what i'm struck by especially is pompeo, the degree to which -- and i %$* 144
think people don't quiet see this yet -- pence is going to be doing a lot of the puppet mastering here in terms of a lot of these agency picks, in terms of a lot of how certain people come to the table. %$* 144
but we don't yet know other than it is a very older white male group. %$* 144
i'm very curious to see and this is not about policy, it still remains to see who he puts behind the podium in terms of press secretary, in terms of daily messaging. %$* 144
given his combative relationship with press, that is going to be incredibly important to watch. %$* 144
sean spicer is still around. %$* 169
and sean spicer got the respect of a lot of press. %$* 169
it could be him, jason miller, another guy. %$* 169
but laura ingraham would be a message to the press that maybe the press has something to be concerned about. %$* 169
exactly. %$* 144
quickly, phil, the response to the cabinet picks so far. %$* 169
what does that tell you, particularly, steve bannon who was going to be, you know, senior adviser, not necessarily a cabinet level pick, or we don't know where he'll be sitting exactly. %$* 169
but steve bannon seems to be the one that elicited the harshest response. %$* 169
let me must read you a quote from steve bannon that appeared to "the hollywood reporter" that a lot of people are talking about. %$* 169
steve bannon says, "darkness is good. %$* 169
dick cheney. %$* 169
darth vader. %$* 169
satan. %$* 169
that's power. %$* 169
it only helps when their critics get it wrong. %$* 169
when they're blind to who we are and what we're doing." %$* 169
again, people seem to have a continuing issue with steve bannon. %$* 169
that's what democrats are picking their fights. %$* 169
right. %$* 57
and steve bannon obviously embraces it. %$* 57
i mean, most normal political actors wouldn't compare themselves favorably to darth vader and satan, i think we can say that. %$* 57
you know, there's what i think this fight against steve bannon in particular says, is that donald trump ran his campaign at no point in time making any significant overtures or any robust overtures to people who weren't working class white folks essentially, right? %$* 57
he made some initial overtures to the black community that really didn't do a whole lot for him electorally. %$* 57
on the subject of those concerns, up next, the president- %$* 249
elect takes on the cast of "hamilton." %$* 249
was a moment aimed at the vice president-elect really as trump insists harassment? %$* 249
but, first, politicians, they say the darndest things. %$* 249
and "saturday night live's" take on the president-elect doing some studying before more into the oval office. %$* 249
google, what is isis? %$* 632
oh my -- 59 million results. %$* 632
siri, how do i kill isis? %$* 632
all right. %$* 169
welcome back to inside politics. %$* 169
surprisingly, the buzziest political story of the weekend not about who will be in the new administration, it's about what happened friday night on broadway. %$* 169
23 a.m. rumbling about it. %$* 424
he tweeted, "the cast and producers of 'hamilton', which i hear is overrated should apologize to mike pence for their terrible behavior." %$* 424
so, what terrible behavior you asked? %$* 424
well, the end of friday night's performance with vice president-elect mike pence in attendance, the cast, they did a little freelancing or as trump called it in an earlier tweet, harassment. %$* 424
watch this. %$* 424
we sir -- we -- are the diverse america who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us. %$* 21
we truly hope that this show inspired you to uphold our american values and to work on behalf of all of us. %$* 21
all of us. %$* 21
all right. %$* 169
a lot of people talking about this on both sides, and i frankly think it's deeply representative of the discussion in the country over the last couple of months. %$* 169
23 a.m. tweet on a sunday which was his third tweet about "hamilton". %$* 366
he deleted. %$* 144
it shows that this is still a guy who will not give things up and is willing to pick a fight with anything and everything including a broadway show. %$* 169
right, exactly. %$* 631
remember the cbs "60 minutes" interview when donald trump talked about twitter as one of the most effective tools of communication. %$* 631
this is a person e-mail, who really sees twitter as a galvanizing force, really. %$* 631
i mean, this is a message -- this is a tool he's used to send messages to his base, to people who support him. %$* 631
i think this really rallies the people who voted him into office. %$* 631
i think there's a lot to be said for a candidate or a president-elect now who doesn't like to apologize, calling on people to apologize, i think there's something rich about that. %$* 631
but, again, i mean, donald trump sees twitter this way. %$* 631
he knows what he's doing with this. %$* 631
there's no more direct attack on coastal elites than going after "hamilton". %$* 169
i mean, literally, it's like stealing a child from someone's house, you know, attacking this broadway show which people here in new york and, again, people who love broadway love, but people maybe in many of these rust belt states may not have had a chance to see yet. %$* 169
well, that's right. %$* 347
it's an absolute perfect metaphor. %$* 347
i mean, you're absolutely that, you know, young people, people of color, daring to play the sort of founding fathers. %$* 347
the obama administration basically -- %$* 347
the obama coalition on stage. %$* 169
the obama coalition, the obama administration, the usurpation of the old america and so forth. %$* 347
so, it's a perfect target. %$* 347
that's why he's aiming his tweets at it. %$* 347
it's also a good way to throw people off trail and have the media talk about this instead of his near brush with a fraud trial that was set told other day, including a million dollars he had to pay for saying he had a university which trump university was not and so forth. %$* 347
so, yes. %$* 347
and, of course, people took to the streets, you know. %$* 347
this isn't just falling on the ears and into the newsrooms of the media, there were people who were out in the streets using boycott "hamilton," sadly not realizing perhaps the show us sold out for the next two years. %$* 347
so, if you want to boycott, you want to start talking 2020 or something like that. %$* 347
but, yes. %$* 347
it was real and it was felt. %$* 347
and if this becomes the way he plays sort of cultural politics going forward, we're going to be in for a lot of this. %$* 347
again, i just -- it's the least ironic thing ever, right? %$* 169
this is everything all tied up in a twitter war with a broadway show. %$* 169
it's the people who don't understand donald trump sort of laughing and snickering and being outraged he's on twitter. %$* 169
it's donald trump on twitter refusing to give something up that he might be better off letting it go. %$* 169
so, this would be interesting to watch if this is just the beginning of more fights like this. %$* 169
but, maggie, errol is talking about the fact that this masks what should be some other serious discussions right, that yes, there's trump university. %$* 169
yes, there's also who is going to be part of his administration and how many people who will be part it closely will he be related to by blood or by marriage or otherwise. %$* 169
you know, jared kushner, ivanka trump, they were in the room when president-elect donald trump met with the prime minister of japan. %$* 169
jared kushner, you know, profile after profile, this is a guy who wants to be a part this administration. %$* 169
it seems that donald trump wants him to be a part of this administration. %$* 169
what's the current situation? %$* 169
what are the current questions still unanswered? %$* 169
i will get to that, but i do want to say one thing. %$* 144
i don't think that everything that he's doing is a deliberate attempt to throw everybody off trail of covering things like what you're asking me about. %$* 144
i think he also cannot help himself. %$* 144
and having been on the receiving end of these bursts of anger from him over the last 18 months, i guarantee you this is not voluntary, number one. %$* 144
number two, i think what is a question in terms of yes, it's effective in what he's doing in speaking to his supporters. %$* 144
this is a 50-50 country. %$* 144
this is an election won by 100,000 votes-ish over three states. %$* 144
there's a whole group of people to your point, the obama coalition, who are seriously worried about what this will mean and he's done nothing to reach out to them so far in a significant way. %$* 144
this is the opposite of that. %$* 169
this is, in fact, the opposite. %$* 144
and it is also taking what was -- he's mischaracterizing and this i think is critically important. %$* 144
he's mischaracterizing repeatedly what was said from stage. %$* 144
there were boos. %$* 144
there was an intentional show of disrespect at pence. %$* 144
some people will feel strongly about that. %$* 144
but what the cast member did, a man playing aaron burr, was very calm, very civil and was very -- and very respectful. %$* 144
and trump is now saying that that's not what was said. %$* 144
i think that's important. %$* 144
to your question, yes, i do think that in the focus on "hamilton", we are missing bigger -- not bigger but certainly i think more significant issues which is that the candidate who ran on the issue of drain the swamp -- i mean that was his hashtag, that was his speech message, is now poised to go in with incredibly troublesome questions about conflict of interest. %$* 144
he keeps saying he's putting his business in a blind trust. %$* 144
having your children run your business is not a blind trust. %$* 144
as you said, his daughter and his son-in-law is looking to come into the administration. %$* 144
that will almost certainly face a legal challenge in terms of nepotism laws. %$* 144
his daughter was in the room for a meeting with the prime minister of japan. %$* 144
none of this would -- what the push back is these are just preliminary meetings or this is not a big deal, or they're not discussing policy. %$* 144
but it's a very slippery slope. %$* 144
and if you look at the amount of focus that we all put on, and certainly trump put on, the clinton foundation, and the overlap with the state department, this is looking potentially very similar to that. %$* 144
so, the status is there's been no change. %$* 144
he held a meeting, interrupted his transition to meet with partners in india for a new project and partners in india were pretty open that they're looking to capitalize on the fact that the president is their new business partner. %$* 144
these are real questions. %$* 144
they are real questions and they're unanswered questions. %$* 169
they've been barely attempted to answer the questions right now. %$* 169
in fact, i would say they have tried not to answer the questions or -- and it's not clear what they are doing and that is, i think, where people's energy is best focused. %$* 144
a little metaphor in this is sort of where trump will choose to live and work and spend his time as president. %$* 169
how much time will he spend in new york? %$* 169
how much time will he spend in bedminster, mar- a-lago? %$* 169
how much time will he spend at the white house, which is where the president lives? %$* 169
kellyanne conway, the former campaign manager for donald, she sort of address that. %$* 169
let's listen. %$* 169
he'll do whatever is necessary. %$* 4
obviously, if his day job is in washington, you will see him there. %$* 4
that's where the day job is, that's where he will be most focused. %$* 4
obviously, it's a very unique situation with somebody who has been incredibly successful and entirely nonpolitical industry in a city away from washington, d.c., but he knows what the job entails. %$* 4
he's going to have the support of his family as he always has. %$* 4
so, phil, she was sort of half joking, but when you call the presidency a day job, that is indicative of the question that maggie was talking about right here. %$* 169
where is the presidency going to begin and the other part of donald trump going to end? %$* 169
right. %$* 57
yes, exactly. %$* 57
i mean, he has paid the proper lip service to the idea that he will have a clear demarcation between his business interest and the presidency. %$* 57
he has not actually exemplified that, as we heard. %$* 57
there's also a story in "the post" about there are diplomats who are staying in the trump hotel in washington, d.c., because they recognize that that is the way to say, i stayed at your hotel, it's great, which obviously will resonate to them. %$* 57
it's an incredible story. %$* 144
right. %$* 57
i mean, i think the thing that's interesting to think about here is not only are we asking about the extent to which donald trump will live in the white house but also with him coming back and staying at trump tower in the weekends. %$* 57
trump tower is where his business is. %$* 57
not only it is his home, that is his business property. %$* 57
and so, i think that that in and of itself is a physical representation. %$* 57
and again, these are questions that have not been answered either deliberately or otherwise. %$* 169
and he talks about his kids, the business being but in a baseline trust for kids. %$* 169
that's neither blind nor a trust, right? %$* 169
and these were things that need to be investigated. %$* 169
all right. %$* 169
the democrats still in disarray. %$* 169
the not-so fresh faces filling the ranks of the democratic leadership and the battle brewing inside the party. %$* 169
and please take our inside politics quiz. %$* 169
do you think that the president should have to live in the white house? %$* 169
vote at cnn.com/vote. %$* 169
all right. %$* 169
welcome back. %$* 169
well, trump tower is abuzz with visitors. %$* 169
the republicans back in washington, they are happily waiting. %$* 169
they soon will control the white house, capitol hill, they have a supreme court pick on the way. %$* 169
we intend on delivering and we're going make sure that this is the most productive congress we've seen in a long, long time. %$* 225
they have given us this unified government and trust to do it. %$* 225
meanwhile, the democrats are regrouping after losing the white house and underperforming by a lot everywhere else and losing breeds acrimony. %$* 169
now house minority leader nancy pelosi facing a challenge from within. %$* 169
we have the lowest number in caucus since 1929 and we've lost over 60 seats since 2010. %$* 225
the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and you keep -- you know, keep getting the same results. %$* 225
so time to move on, i think. %$* 225
all right. %$* 169
back now with our panel. %$* 169
i want to start with the republicans, if i can, caitlin, because one of the things that was notable during this election was the republican divide in regards to donald trump. %$* 169
and marco rubio when he announced for senate his announcement was, i'm going stand up to whoever is in the white house. %$* 169
you know, the implication was even if it's donald trump. %$* 169
but where are republicans going to stand up to donald trump now? %$* 169
you don't get the sense they are exactly itching to battle with him right now. %$* 169
on the contrary you saw in the open of the show paul ryan's big fat giant smile. %$* 169
yes. %$* 631
he's thrilled that they're finally going to have a republican in the white house. %$* 169
nothing brings people together like winning. %$* 631
right? %$* 631
and so this week on capitol hill everyone was -- in the republican conference was wearing those red "make america great" hats. %$* 631
you talk to republicans who said yes, we disagreed with him on this but, you know, we won and now we can, you know, do all these certain things. %$* 631
so certainly those divisions are certainly going to remain but they are very happy right now with what happened. %$* 631
but at the same time they're still really getting to know donald trump as a person, as a -- a lot of people described him as a kind of third-party candidate. %$* 631
and so there are still a lot of questions about what their priorities will be. %$* 631
the issue of government spending, the issue of obamacare and those sorts of things i think will kind of highlight that. %$* 631
you know, ted cruz, he had a chance to speak. %$* 169
obviously ted cruz ran against donald trump. %$* 169
but ted cruz is one of those republicans who has since met with donald trump and seems to be relatively on board with what donald trump is doing, the president- elect. %$* 169
listen to what ted cruz has to say. %$* 169
when you're given control of the executive and the legislature, it's time to put up or shut up. %$* 228
there are no excuses. %$* 228
we've got to deliver and i think that is what the voters across the country expect, and it's what i very much hope we'll give them. %$* 228
philip bump, you know, is donald trump going deliver for the republicans in congress or are the republicans in congress going to deliver for donald trump? %$* 169
well, i mean, i think it's important to remember that donald trump won the presidency without having this giant platform of policy positions. %$* 57
right? %$* 57
i mean, he said explicitly in august of last year that he really didn't care about policy details. %$* 57
he didn't think the voters cared about the policy details. %$* 57
there are certain things that he focuses on trade or, you know, he focuses on a few other things, immigration obviously. %$* 57
but as a general rule i think the republicans in congress or republicans in the legislative branch justifiably feel as though they're going to have something of a carte blanche to do what they want to do with donald trump going along with it. %$* 57
i mean, you know, we'll see how this dynamic plays out particularly as donald trump takes office and is president for a while but that seems to be the attitude. %$* 57
we seem to seeing budget hawks like paul ryan if those hawks are still flying right now if they're going to care as much about deficits and other things as they have over the last eight years or beyond that. %$* 169
errol louis, let's talk about the other side of the aisle right now. %$* 169
chuck schumer, from the great state of new york. %$* 169
you know the state you live in. %$* 169
chuck schumer, your senator. %$* 169
he's got a big role to play right now. %$* 169
he considers himself really the last man standing. %$* 169
the democrats in the senate may have the only block on a trump administration. %$* 169
this is what chuck schumer said about his responsibilities. %$* 169
now there's a debate going on about whether we should be the party of the diverse, obama coalition, or the blue-collar american in the heartland. %$* 408
some think we need to make a choice. %$* 408
there must not be a division. %$* 408
we need to be the party that speaks to and works on behalf of all americans. %$* 408
where is chuck schumer going to fight, errol? %$* 169
well, i think he's going to fight first and foremost to be the conference leader. %$* 347
and the leadership team that he brought in place first and foremost i think is focused 2018 and trying to make sure that they don't lose even more seats. %$* 347
he's got 24 seats to defend just two years -- two short years from now. %$* 347
he's got a very difficult job that he was just describing, meaning that you've got -- you know, your sort of your obama coalition democrats who want to talk about identity politics, they want to talk about lgbtq rights, they want to talk about re-energizing the sort of emerging coalition of millennials and young people and sort of. %$* 347
and then you've got the rest of the country and he's got to be concerned about both. %$* 347
so i think you're going to see him fighting like heck to make sure that his marginals, the democrats who are in north dakota and in montana are going to have a shot, and you know, west virginia. %$* 347
that they're going to have a shot at survival two years from now so that he doesn't become an even sort of a weaker minority. %$* 347
that's a real interesting choice he faces, maggie, because, you know, heidi heitkamp, john tester, joe donnelly, these democrats from conservative states who are up for re-election. %$* 169
they don't necessarily represent the desires of the obama coalition and, you know, the popular vote which went for hillary clinton. %$* 169
haberman:  correct. %$* 169
and the incoming president is actually in a real %$* 169
position to squeeze them. %$* 169
i mean, if you think about the -- trump's folks are very aware of the number of red state democrats who are up for re-election in 2018 and they think that those people can be an equal weight to say if you have a ben sasse who was very vocally against donald trump during the campaign. %$* 169
if sasse and maybe a couple other people, lindsey graham and maybe mccain, decide to oppose certain things that trump wants, trump's people know that they have a block of democrats who they are going to be able to squeeze because the trump voters are going to be people they need. %$* 169
that's going to be a real conundrum for schumer. %$* 169
schumer is, to my line, to be clear, the most interesting person to watch in congress in a lot of way just because he's the person who trump knows the best and he, unlike most democrats, certainly unlike harry reid, was not that overtly critical of trump. %$* 169
he hasn't really been in recent days. %$* 169
he knows what will inflame trump. %$* 169
trump at the al smith dinner, the charity dinner, a couple of weeks before the election, mentioned schumer on the dais and acknowledged him. %$* 169
but i think that schumer is going to be really squeezed between two competing impulses. %$* 169
and maggie, you're saying the most interesting democrat on the hill will be chuck schumer to watch. %$* 169
i think one of the most interesting democrats to watch over the next year or two will be outgoing president obama who up until this point has been very careful. %$* 169
he has said all the things that an outgoing president is supposed to say in terms of cooperating with the incoming administration. %$* 169
but there's an article in the "new york times" today by michael shear that suggests that obama might not disappear after the election the way that he may have wanted to or been intending to. %$* 169
that he may stand up and battle the administration on issues like obamacare and whatnot. %$* 169
that will be interesting, but also be relatively unprecedented. %$* 169
i mean, i can't remember another time when that's been the case. %$* 169
well, also, i mean, his approval ratings are very high for an outgoing second term -- %$* 631
which oddly and uncharacteristically he mentions all the time. %$* 169
all the time. %$* 631
yes. %$* 169
especially abroad. %$* 631
especially abroad. %$* 631
what democrats are battling, what schumer alluded to is whether they want to be the party of barack obama or the party of bernie sanders, right? %$* 631
even though bernie sanders is not part of the democratic party and when i asked him he said he's not joining it any time soon. %$* 631
barack obama is still very popular, of course. %$* 631
i talked to lots of democrats who envision him -- who support him, who envision him, still maintaining a very public role in the party, traveling around the country and that sort of thing. %$* 631
he's still very young, of course. %$* 631
he's still popular. %$* 631
still very involved. %$* 631
they want to try to do two things at once but they do have a very -- %$* 631
you know, they pride themselves on having a big tent but there are a lot of people who feel that this election was a rejection of what a lot of obama was saying. %$* 631
a lot of his policy initiatives. %$* 631
a lot of what democrats have done in congress. %$* 631
and so that's why you're seeing this push back in the house against nancy pelosi. %$* 631
i've talked to a lot of democrats who say even if she remains our leader we at least want to go the home to our constituents and say, we put up a fight against her and we're trying to absorb and digest the lessons that you're sending us from the electorate particularly in the middle of the country. %$* 631
all right, guys. %$* 169
up next, another democrat we're going talk about, hillary clinton. %$* 169
she just lost an election and she had an impassioned message to supporters. %$* 169
i know this isn't easy. %$* 149
i know that over the past week a people have asked themselves whether america is the country we thought it was. %$* 149
but please listen to me when i say this. %$* 149
america is worth it. %$* 149
it has been almost two weeks since hillary clinton's white house defeat. %$* 169
for her clearly the wound is still fresh. %$* 169
i will admit coming here tonight wasn't the easiest thing for me. %$* 149
there have been a few times this past week when all i wanted to do was just to curl up with a good book or our dogs and never leave the house again. %$* 149
for democrats as a whole now is time to rebuild and recover and bernie sanders warns that change can't come soon enough. %$* 169
if we are going to go forward successfully, the democratic party has got to recognize some very important realities that donald trump, in fact, did recognize. %$* 128
there are millions of people today, working class people, middle class people, low-income people who are living in despair. %$* 128
and we have got to recognize that reality. %$* 128
phil, i want to start with you. %$* 169
back now with our panel. %$* 169
do you get sense that the clinton campaign and democrats feel like they know why they loss? %$* 169
because when you listen to bernie sanders and then also when you listen to a few clinton campaign officials who spoke out loud it's sort of a mixture of everything. %$* 169
right. %$* 57
yes, i mean, and part of the reason it's a mixture of everything is because the loss was so close. %$* 57
i mean, maggie made the point earlier. %$* 57
it's about 100,000 people in three upper midwest states. %$* 57
i think that there are a few convening things happening here. %$* 57
people who worked on the campaign, they want to push the blame somewhere else because they need to work in campaign again. %$* 57
there are people who are internally very realistic and understand what it was, that it's combination of factors that really played a key role including not doing a lot of great geo-tv in the upper midwest, perhaps having a bad advertising strategy and focusing on attacking donald trump instead of focusing on a positive message, particularly on economics. %$* 57
there are a lot of factors here but i think the general consensus is probably the accurate consensus which is that this was hillary clinton's to lose and hillary clinton lost it. %$* 57
and, you know, the -- where that happened on the chain of command i think is being worked out. %$* 57
i don't think that's true at all. %$* 144
i think that most clinton people -- talking about clinton folks specifically, democrats, i would agree more broadly. %$* 144
sure. %$* 57
yes. %$* 57
clinton folks specifically are very focused on the comey letter, among other things. %$* 144
and basically blaming the media for the existence of the coverage of it or, you know, focused on why did this get played the way it did? %$* 144
i mean, by the time that the comey letter emerged there was not a single news story that did that. %$* 144
there was so much noise. %$* 144
it was so unprecedented. %$* 144
the comey letter at the end of the day doesn't exist if hillary clinton doesn't have that e-mail server and all of the things that followed. %$* 144
and at the end of the day, an fbi investigation into a nominee is just not a great fact set. %$* 144
it's -- no matter what precise words that are used to do it, i also think that everything that phil said is true in terms of advertising strategy and geo-tv. %$* 144
she was a flawed candidate for this moment. %$* 144
i mean, if you're just looking at that being realistic. %$* 144
i can go back to the paid speeches in 2013 as sort of an original sin, and that came back in wikileaks and wikileaks had an intervention. %$* 144
that's the other thing that gets a lot of blamed for this. %$* 144
you know, errol, i had karen finney, you know, senior adviser on this week on one of the shows that i do, and she listed sexism, she listed third-party candidates. %$* 169
she said the comey letter, she said the media. %$* 169
she didn't talk about, you know, white non-college educated voters which is sort of this wave it seems to have been decisive in many places. %$* 169
yes. %$* 144
berman:  and all of the things she brings up, you know, they may have %$* 144
contributed in some way but it doesn't explain how barack obama won ohio twice and hillary clinton lost ohio by eight points. %$* 144
well, that's right. %$* 347
i mean, there's a -- there's also, look, there are swing voters out there, right? %$* 347
and there are swing counties out there and so -- and many of them are in the industrial midwest. %$* 347
so they go one way, they go another way. %$* 347
there is such a thing as sort of staying too long. %$* 347
there's this larger question, by the way, that nobody wants to talk about which is that, you know, barack obama's political legacy has to include those four straight consecutive losses in the house, the loss of all of those seats in the state legislatures, the redefining of the democratic party in such a way that it's been impossible for them to win and difficult for them to rebuild. %$* 347
i mean, that's one of the part of i think why he stays around to do a little legacy work. %$* 347
it's also worth pointing out, though, you know, and we should never lose sight of this when the national security apparatus says that there's been outside interference in this election and we know where it came from. %$* 347
if this is applied to any other country in the world, in the developing world we'd say, you know, russia was interfering and that this was a very serious problem. %$* 347
in this case, there's this almost willful blindness to it that there was outside interference. %$* 347
now, i mean, you know, you can take it as an excuse and there are a million of other reasons why the election played out the way it did but we should never lose sight of that. %$* 347
you brought it up. %$* 169
and i just want to talk about it one more time. %$* 169
you talk about the president and how this election is seen by some as a repudiation in some way of his eight years in office or at least his inability to win elections for others besides himself. %$* 169
and again, caitlin, i'm struck by fact that he's gone around the world the last week and at these news conferences he makes a point of talking about his approval rating. %$* 169
because he's been asked these questions. %$* 169
you know, what does this election say about what people think of you and your administration. %$* 169
they like me, i'm at 54 percent or 55 percent. %$* 169
that may be missing the point. %$* 169
right. %$* 631
well, remember at the -- for the past several months the president had been campaigning around the country for hillary clinton telling his own supporters if you don't vote for clinton i will take that as a personal offense. %$* 631
i'm paraphrasing there but that was the general message and they still didn't come out. %$* 631
when you look at trump's numbers compared to romney and mccain, they're relatively the same as the numbers that have gone down from the obama coalition. %$* 631
so certainly i think the president is not wanting to admit that people come out to vote for him and not necessarily for other democrats. %$* 631
and when democrats are thinking about rebuilding it is going into tapping into the more grassroots elements of the party. %$* 631
you talk to people like sanders, people like keith ellison, others in the party who want to get democrats away from the big donor base and get them involved in some of the more -- you know, talking to the people that they say that they are representing. %$* 631
i want to play some sound from a guy who's not a democratic strategist but does have a take on what happened to this election. %$* 169
senator ted cruz. %$* 169
he talked about the fact that in some way this whole election was the revenge of what's known as flyover country. %$* 169
well, i think the election was an incredible vindication for the american people across this country and especially those as you know in rural america in what elites on both coasts consider to be flyover country. %$* 228
this election could be well understood as the revenge of flyover country. %$* 228
not to go back to "hamilton" but i'm going to go back to "hamilton," maggie haberman. %$* 169
but again, this explains why this twitter battle or this battle friday night -- this started friday night with the cast of "hamilton" and mike pence and donald trump has taken up is so indicative of what's going on in the country right now. %$* 169
there's an element of what ted cruz is saying that is part of this discussion. %$* 169
it is a part it. %$* 144
it is not the only thing. %$* 144
it is certainly a part it. %$* 144
what bernie sanders was saying was actually not really about identity and racial politics. %$* 144
he was talking about class politics. %$* 144
he's talking about how people are despairing in their lives and that is across a lot of different segments of voters. %$* 144
and that's -- i got to go here. %$* 169
yes. %$* 144
but that is why the democrats and what the democrats are going need to talk about. %$* 169
they're also going to need to understand that voters are static and going to vote the same way every single time. %$* 144
and that's a big deal. %$* 144
all right. %$* 169
guys, thanks so much. %$* 169
coming up a sneak peek into out reporters' notebook. %$* 169
donald trump just added "saturday night live" to his sunday morning list of twitter targets. %$* 169
will twitter be the go-to source of news bulletin in the trump administration? %$* 169
and we ask, do you think the president should have to live in the white house? %$* 169
most of you a huge majority say live in the white house. %$* 169
move there. %$* 169
it's a nice place. %$* 169
we'll be right back. %$* 169
all right. %$* 169
let's go around the inside politics table and ask our reporters to get you out ahead of the big political news just around the corner. %$* 169
caitlin, let's start with you. %$* 169
sure. %$* 631
well, republicans are suddenly finding a lot to like in their nominee but they're also trying to navigate a world in which they don't really know him that well and they're still at odds on a lot of significant policy issues that are going to come out perhaps right off the gate. %$* 631
government spending when it comes to infrastructure projects, foreign policy when it comes to russia, touching entitlements and those sorts of things. %$* 631
i'm watching how republicans navigate this new trump world. %$* 631
or if, is the other thing. %$* 169
all right. %$* 169
errol louis, you? %$* 169
an astounding number of conflicts of interest that really require a lot of looking into. %$* 347
so 40 wall street which is by far the most successful of the real estate deals that still has trump's name on it was the place where trump university was headquartered but also a couple of dozen other places where prosecutors have either convicted or investigated various people. %$* 347
pump and dump schemes. %$* 347
all kinds of fraud. %$* 347
fugitives who are still on the fbi's most wanted list. %$* 347
and it raises an interesting kind of conflict. %$* 347
can the sitting president be earning money from people who his same federal government is supposed to be investigating, prosecuting, pursuing and in some cases prosecuting and imprisoning? %$* 347
and questions about oversight, too, and where it may come from. %$* 169
philip bump, you turn. %$* 169
so i think one of the things that we're going to be watching very carefully is how president-elect or presidential candidate donald trump becomes president-elect donald trump becomes president donald trump on social media, the way he interacts with the media, the way he keeps floating various rumors about his cabinet picks. %$* 57
the way he gets into weird fights on twitter continue even as president-elect. %$* 57
and what that says about him as a president. %$* 57
i think it's going to be interesting to watch during this transitional period how he uses social media, how he uses rumors as an indicator of how he'll actually be once he's in the presidency. %$* 57
as a president and a theater critic. %$* 169
all right, maggie haberman. %$* 169
sorry. %$* 144
the story of rebuilding a party is not the republican party as we had all assumed it would be. %$* 144
it's the democratic party. %$* 144
and one name that i have now heard a few times as a possibility, hope for possibility for dnc chairman is outgoing vice president joe biden. %$* 144
there are a lot of people who think that he would be sort of the perfect voice towards the white working class voters that the party is looking to attract. %$* 144
no indication this is what biden wants but it is something that is being talked about right now. %$* 144
berman:  fascinating. %$* 144
all right. %$* 144
guys, thank you all so much. %$* 144
that %$* 144
is all for inside politics again. %$* 144
thanks for sharing your sunday morning. %$* 144
up next "state of the union" with jake tapper. %$* 144
on his guest list, donald trump's chief of staff pick, reince priebus. %$* 144

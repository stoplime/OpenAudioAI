good morning. %$* 161
the day after the nomination:  president bush and his supreme court pick hit the ground running. %$* 116
are they facing a fight or a cakewalk? %$* 116
i urge the senate to rise to the occasion to provide a fair and civil process. %$* 161
the campaign to define the nominee is under way with a degree of caution by democrats. %$* 708
the real issue in these hearings is going to be on who -- judge roberts is on who's side. %$* 324
i believe that judge roberts is exactly the kind of justice america expects on the supreme court. %$* 507
the un-bork:  we'll count the way john roberts is different from the famously failed nominee of the reagan era. %$* 116
we'll examine robert's past rulings featuring fast foods and reptiles. %$* 709
now live from washington, cnn's inside politics. %$* 709
well thanks for joining us. %$* 307
i'm suzanne malveaux. %$* 307
and there hasn't been this much choreography on network television since the finale of "dancing with the stars." %$* 307
in the last 24 hours judge john roberts' introduction to america has been playing out how the white house wanted it. %$* 307
the supreme court nominee's debut is continuing this hour on capitol hill with key senators of both parties sending signals that roberts' confirmation prospects are good. %$* 307
we begin with our congressional correspondent, joe johns -- joe? %$* 307
suzanne, that certainly does seem to be the case. %$* 360
judge roberts on capitol hill today making the rounds, talking to democrats and republicans; expected in a little bit to talk to senator patrick leahy of vermont, the ranking democrat on the senate judiciary committee. %$* 360
this is a period when a nominee for the court essentially is defined on capitol hill and in the media. %$* 360
he is being called a brilliant choice, even by some democrats off the hill who say he is to the right, but not so far to the right as to fire up the opposition. %$* 360
just a little while ago, i asked senator ben nelson, who was the leader -- the democratic leader of the so-called gang of 14 that essentially came up with that fix to head-off filibusters on judicial nomination, whether he thinks there will be an attempt to try to block this nomination? %$* 360
well, i'm certainly not thinking about it right now and i don't -- i'm not hearing anybody. %$* 420
sometimes there's hallway whisper. %$* 420
none of that to date. %$* 420
it's still new, but i'm not hearing it and i think by this point in time, that could very well be the case. %$* 420
republicans, obviously being much more openly complimentary of this nomination, talking about his service at hogan and hartson, the law firm here in town; his service on the court, even though for a very brief period down at the d.c. %$* 360
circuit court of appeals. %$* 360
senator john mccain on the floor, also talking about the possibility of a filibuster which he just doesn't see happening. %$* 360
i am a member -- a card-carrying member of the gang of 14 and one of the criteria of the gang of 14 is that we would not filibuster a nominee to a court or the supreme court if unless it was quote, "extraordinary circumstances." %$* 368
i do not speak for the 14 members. %$* 368
i only speak for myself, but having been in on those negotiations about extraordinary circumstances for hundreds of hours, i think that judge roberts deserves an up-or- down vote and i hope that the other members of that group would also agree with me. %$* 368
still, there is reason to expect some hard questions for judge roberts, particularly among people who are concerned about the issue of abortion on the democratic side. %$* 360
senator barbara boxer of california, saying she just doesn't know enough about him right now to say whether she thinks he'll be good on her view of abortion, which is essentially pro-abortion. %$* 360
i don't know enough, but you know, whether someone is flamboyant about their views and votes to the far right and someone else is not flamboyant, but votes to the far right, at the end of the day, a woman could go to jail for exercising a right to choose. %$* 710
and it is not quite the end of the day here on capitol hill. %$* 360
roberts still talking to people including senate democratic leader harry reid just a little while ago. %$* 360
he's got a lot more talking to do here on capitol hill. %$* 360
obviously, down the road we have the issue of questions submitted to him. %$* 360
we have the issue of a confirmation hearing. %$* 360
of course, he's had a confirmation hearing here on capitol hill just within the last two or three years. %$* 360
he was able to get through and go down to the d.c. %$* 360
circuit court of appeals. %$* 360
a lot of democrats, however, saying right now the standard is completely different, than it was for him to go to the circuit court. %$* 360
back to you, suzanne. %$* 360
not even close to the end of the day. %$* 307
thank you so much, joe johns. %$* 307
and now on to the white house where the president and judge roberts began their day with coffee and more of their full court press for his confirmation. %$* 307
let's bring in our white house correspondent dana bash -- dana? %$* 307
hi, suzanne. %$* 32
making the rounds up there, but also starting the day here at the white house this morning. %$* 244
driving himself and in his own car. %$* 424
coming here for a not-so-average kind of meeting and   that is of course, having coffee with the president of the united states, the morning after he decided that he is, of course, his pick to be at the supreme court. %$* 424
now, the next part of this well-choreographed day. %$* 424
you see the two men there stepping into the rose garden and at that time, president bush took the opportunity to make another plea to democrats on capitol hill for what he called fairness and civility. %$* 424
in my conversations with senators last night, we discussed how important it is that judge roberts get a fair hearing, a timely hearing and a hearing that will bring great credit to our nation and to the united states senate. %$* 161
now, there were also some key republican senators here at the white house today, meeting with roberts, meeting with some of the strategists here at the white house to guide roberts through the minefields of all this including -- there you see karl rove, but that also included ed gillespie, former rnc chairman who is the white house point person to do all that. %$* 32
and essentially, what they feel here at the white house is that they might have really threaded the political needle. %$* 32
they understand that they needed to find somebody who is a known quantity among conservatives and they feel like they have done that despite the irony, perhaps, of a president who says that he is the quintessential outsider picking, perhaps, the quintessential insider. %$* 32
because he is somebody who worked in a republican administration, somebody who is known, again, inside washington by conservatives, but also, even probably more importantly, somebody who is known inside washington by democrats and worked with democrats. %$* 711
jack keeney. %$* 712
he's a conservative politically, but he is an incredible legal intellect. %$* 713
so, i don't see him as joining justice scalia in a particular opinion or justice thomas in a particular opinion. %$* 713
what i actually see is judge roberts becoming justice roberts and getting people to join his opinions, because his analysis, i think, will be pretty straightforward and pretty much right down the middle. %$* 713
now, having somebody -- a democrat who did work for president clinton, then president gore in their campaigns, saying that he doesn't think that roberts is in the mold of thomas and scalia -- might not be what conservatives want to hear. %$* 32
but again, it's that idea of sort of going down the middle when it comes to confirmation and at this point, that is clearly what the white house is very much focused on -- suzanne? %$* 32
dana bash, thank you very much. %$* 307
now, abortion rights activists are raising red flags about john roberts, saying they have grave concerns about his stand on roe v. wade. %$* 307
in demonstrations today, womens groups and others urged senators to ask tough questions about roberts' past statements about abortion. %$* 307
in 1990, when he was deputy solicitor general for the first president bush, roberts co-authored a brief saying, "we continue to believe that roe was wrongly decided and should be overruled." %$* 307
roberts was asked to explain his position during his 2003 confirmation hearings to become an appeals court judge. %$* 307
he explained the 1990 brief by saying he was acting as an advocate for his client. %$* 307
roberts went on to say that, "roe v. wade is the settled law of the land," and he said there is nothing in his personal views that would prevent him from upholding that law. %$* 307
there's no role for advocacy with respect to personal beliefs or views on the part of a judge. %$* 405
the judge is bound to follow the supreme court precedent whether he agrees with it or disagrees with it and bound to apply the rule of law in cases whether there's applicable supreme court precedent or not. %$* 405
personal views, personal ideology -- those have no role to play whatever. %$* 405
and during that confirmation hearing, roberts said it would not be appropriate for him to comment on rove vs. wade as an example of judicial activism. %$* 307
both democrats and republicans are armed today with talking points aplenty. %$* 307
up next, the ranking democrat on the judiciary committee, senator patrick leahy, talks about john roberts and the hearings ahead. %$* 307
and later, republican reaction from the white house and senator sam brownback. %$* 307
plus, the ad war had begun even before the president named his high court nominee. %$* 307
leaders of opposing interest groups will bring their battle right here. %$* 307
and later, karl rove and the cia leak controversy. %$* 307
out of the headlines, but not forgotten on capitol hill. %$* 307
and this just in. %$* 307
we have breaking news here at cnn regarding the london bombings. %$* 307
joining us now is our own kelli arena with the story -- kelli. %$* 307
suzanne, officials familiar with that investigation tell cnn that a man british authorities would like to speak with in connection with the bombings allegedly traveled to the united states in 1999 to help set up a terror training camp in bly, oregon. %$* 714
sources say that the man, known either rashid haroon aswad or haroon rashid aswad, allegedly evaluated property in bly for terror training, set up security around that property. %$* 714
kelli arena, thanks very much for the update. %$* 249
please keep us posted. %$* 249
i know you will. %$* 249
sure will. %$* 714
and on to the rest of the show, of course. %$* 307
the john roberts nomination has sparked a range of responses among senate democrats. %$* 307
with me now to share his thoughts is senator patrick leahy of vermont, the ranking democrat on the senate judiciary committee. %$* 307
thank you very much, senator, for joining us. %$* 307
happy to be with you. %$* 598
it's a busy day here on the hill. %$* 598
absolutely. %$* 307
busy day for everybody, i'm sure. %$* 307
now, let's start with the first issue here. %$* 307
democrats had asked for consultation and immediately the white house bombarded democrats with calls. %$* 307
yesterday, president bush could say, with roberts by his side, that he had reached out to the party. %$* 307
he had listened and here was his pick, a solidly conservative nominee. %$* 307
was this a serious consultation? %$* 307
or do you think you were played? %$* 307
well, i think a number of our thoughts were heard. %$* 598
it was not as thorough a consultation as i would have liked. %$* 598
we suggested names to him, not the other way around. %$* 598
it was somewhat different than the consultation we had with the reagan administration or the clinton administration, which was far more thorough. %$* 598
but with this administration it was far more extensive than we normally would have. %$* 598
i had a number of -- several good talks with the president, including last night, when he called me on judge roberts. %$* 598
he obviously has to make the final decision. %$* 598
i know some of the names that had been considered by the white house would have created enormous problems. %$* 598
but i think now we have a nominee. %$* 598
we'll sit down, we'll do our due diligence. %$* 598
i expect to spend a lot of the month of august in my home in vermont reading all of judge roberts' opinions and writings, as well as the background material about him so that sometime in september we can have thorough and open hearings. %$* 598
now, senator, there was so much discussion, and even speculation if you will, that there were other candidates more palatable to the democrats that he might have considered -- edith clement or alberto gonzales. %$* 307
why do you suppose that the president did not go that way? %$* 307
were the democrats not effective, not convincing in their case for the need for a consensus candidate? %$* 307
well, i don't think -- you know, the president at no time said, "ok, come in and make a case for this person or that person." %$* 598
i have had -- past presidents have. %$* 598
this president did not. %$* 598
so it's not a case of him rejecting somebody we brought in. %$* 598
but we rather purposely did not give a whole list of names saying these are all great candidates, because with some at the white house, of course, that would be the kiss of death for them. %$* 598
but the president heard the things that we suggested. %$* 598
i said to him, as i've said oftentimes publicly, "give us a nominee who can unite us and not divide us." %$* 598
and we'll find out after we have had the hearings whether that is the case. %$* 598
well, senator, what is the most important issue for his record that you need to know to confirm him? %$* 307
obviously roe v. wade, abortion rights is going to play very high in the hearings. %$* 307
that goes into the whole issue of settled law. %$* 598
i mean, that's everything from brown v. board of education, roe v. wade, miranda,  a whole lot of different areas. %$* 598
and we'd like to know what his role is going to be in that. %$* 598
you know, we have right now the most activist supreme court in my lifetime. %$* 598
this is a supreme court that has overturned more legislation written by congress, everything from the violence against women's act to environmental areas. %$* 598
but specifically on abortion rights, what do you need to hear from him? %$* 307
let me finish, because this is part of it. %$* 598
and they've replaced it by really creating laws of their own. %$* 598
it is the most activist. %$* 598
so i'm going to ask him, are you going to be part of that same activist coalition overturning settled law, rewriting the law yourself? %$* 598
and among those, of course, is going to be roe v. wade. %$* 598
now, of course, when you asked justice clarence thomas about that case during his confirmation hearings, he responded that he never discussed roe v. wade. %$* 307
is that the kind of answer that is going to be acceptable to you this time around, or what do you need to hear from him? %$* 307
well, that wasn't acceptable from justice thomas. %$* 598
i don't think anybody believed him. %$* 598
roe v. wade came down while he was in law school. %$* 598
i know having been a law student myself, any case that comes down from the supreme court you discuss and discuss at length, especially a milestone case like roe v. wade, because you know the professors are going to ask you questions about it. %$* 598
so i don't think anybody believed clarence thomas' answer when he stated under oath he had never discussed roe v. wade. %$* 598
senator patrick leahy, thank you very much for joining us. %$* 307
sorry we're out of time. %$* 307
take care. %$* 307
thank you. %$* 598
next, sandra day o'connor reacts to word of her potential replacement. %$* 598
up next, we'll hear what the retiring justice has to say about the man who would take her place on the high court. %$* 598
the justice who john roberts would replace in the high court was far from the nation's capital when her proposed successor was announced. %$* 307
sandra day o'connor spent the day fly fishing in idaho along with her husband and the outdoors editor of the "spokane spokesman review" newspaper. %$* 307
when she learned that roberts was the president's choice, o'connor is quoted as saying,"that's fabulous." %$* 307
she described roberts as a "brilliant legal mind, a straight shooter, articulate and he should not have trouble being confirmed by october." %$* 307
then she went on to say quote, "he's good in every way except he's not a woman." %$* 307
with me now from the white house for more on the roberts nomination is nicolle devenish, a very capable woman, she is the president's communication director. %$* 307
obviously, nicolle, you have had a very, very busy day. %$* 307
the president as well as judge roberts, a very good day from all accounts. %$* 307
now, let's start off with the process here. %$* 307
democrats initially had asked for consultation. %$* 307
the white house immediately set up this operation with phone calls, meetings, really an all out campaign. %$* 307
and many of those democrats had expressed their desire to put a minority or a woman in that position. %$* 307
instead the president elected a white male conservative. %$* 307
was that just for show? %$* 307
well i think if the president has a record of, going as far back as his time as governor of texas, of appointing unprecedented numbers of women and minorities in senior positions in his administration, and i assure you that the list from which he chose the eminently qualified judge roberts contained a broad swathe of the american public. %$* 715
it contained women and minorities. %$* 715
and the president, no matter who had -- whose seat he was filling he would have insisted that he be able to choose from a list of candidates that reflected the american population. %$* 715
now let me also say that those consultations resulted in names that the democrats and republicans suggested, and a name that was suggested to this white house was judge roberts. %$* 715
so i don't think there's any basis for saying that any of those consultations were for show and obviously the democrats that raised his name know who they are. %$* 715
and it's a private process that we'll keep private, but it's very important that people understand that those consultations were take very seriously. %$* 715
they consumed a great amount of time from the president down through his senior staff and doj staff, as well. %$* 715
and their feedback was taken very seriously. %$* 715
and i think it's reflected in the president's selection of a very fair, a very qualified nominee in judge roberts, and someone who has earned high praise from democrats and republicans. %$* 715
but some of your critics even say that all this talk of considering a woman or a hispanic like gonzalez, was simply meant to soften the blow for the president ultimately to pick a selection which was total mainstream. %$* 307
well, you know, again, we don't take responsibility for people that were putting out inaccurate information yesterday. %$* 715
it's unfortunate when people go out on a limb and speculate about a choice we worked very hard to very keep private. %$* 715
in deference and out of our respect for every candidate that we consider, but the president's focus from the very beginning of really, his time in office, was to find someone who would be the most qualified nominee to the highest court in the land. %$* 715
it's a decision that he views as one of the most consequential decisions that any president makes. %$* 715
it's a nomination that president reagan called an awesome appointment. %$* 715
and it is one that he made with a singular focus on the most qualified jurist out there. %$* 715
and you know i think there have been some extraordinary moments. %$* 715
i think that we saw from judge roberts the deep reverence he has for the court. %$* 715
he talked about the lump in his throat that he feels when he walks up the marble steps. %$* 715
and i think this is an extraordinary moment. %$* 715
it's been 11 years since we have seen an individual nominated to the supreme court, and judge roberts is worthy of that nomination. %$* 715
nicolle? %$* 307
so sorry to cut you off. %$* 307
i'm sorry, we're going to have to leave it there. %$* 307
thanks so much. %$* 307
appreciate it. %$* 307
when president bush and judge roberts appeared on national television last night, there was a sideshow going on that viewers missed. %$* 307
roberts wife jane marie stood off camera with their children. %$* 307
four-year-old jack and 5-year-old josephine. %$* 307
but as kids do, they got a little bit restless. %$* 307
when the networks later took a cut away shots of mrs. roberts, the children were out of the picture. %$* 307
it called to mind the unpredictability, when little ones are thrust into the political arena. %$* 307
john edwards' kids were showcased in the 2004 presidential campaign, usually to the democrats advantage. %$* 307
and many political junkies still remember rudy giuliani's first inauguration as mayor with fondness and amusement, because of his then young son andrew's tactics. %$* 307
based on the initial reaction to judge roberts nomination, you could say he is no robert bork. %$* 307
still ahead, the tale of two nominees. %$* 307
one who might make it through and one who didn't. %$* 307
plus, the partisan interest groups have their guns out and the ads are flying. %$* 307
we'll ask dueling advocates if their battle is full fledged to likely to fizzle. %$* 307
as the markets get set to close on wall street, i'm joined by christine romans in new york with "the dobbs reported" -- christine? %$* 307
thanks, suzanne. %$* 369
stocks higher here right now. %$* 369
the dow industrial average is up, oh, about 39 points, 10,686. %$* 369
the nasdaq is 0.75 percent higher. %$* 369
it's now in positive territory for the first time this year. %$* 369
fed chief alan greenspan told a house panel that the economy is in good shape and the fed will continue to raise interest rates. %$* 369
general motors posted much more of a loss than it thought in the second quarter. %$* 369
while the automaker's popular employee discounts for all program brought back buyers, it also cut into margins, and it didn't do anything to offset rising health care costs for workers and retirees. %$* 369
another well-known company, kodak, also struggling. %$* 369
for the third quarter in a row now it lost money, and said it will cut another 10,000 jobs. %$* 369
kodak says traditional film sales are declining a lot faster than expected. %$* 369
this, as more people go digital. %$* 369
in other news, chevron has won the latest round in the fight to take over unocal. %$* 369
unocal's board of directors voted in favor of a sweetened offer from chevron. %$* 369
chevron raised its bid last night to more than $17 billion, but that's still a billion less than a competing bid for the company by chinese oil company cnooc. %$* 369
however, the cnooc deal has raised national security concerns, and there are lots of questions about whether it could even win government approval. %$* 369
cnooc says it's not giving up and its offer still stands. %$* 369
00 eastern on "lou dobbs tonight," president bush calls on the senate to confirm judge john roberts to the supreme court. %$* 716
senate judiciary committee members jeff sessions, dianne feinstein, and dick durbin will play a key role in that decision. %$* 716
they'll join us live from capitol hill. %$* 716
and the justice department is opposing the proposed shield law in congress designed to protect reporters from being forced to identify their sources. %$* 716
we'll have a report. %$* 716
plus, we'll discuss issues concerning hispanics in this country with the director of the nation's largest hispanic organization, the national council of la raza. %$* 716
00 eastern, "lou dobbs tonight." %$* 501
suzanne, back to you. %$* 501
thanks, christine. %$* 307
now this just in. %$* 307
breaking news here. %$* 307
cnn has confirmed this -- and this just coming off the wires, as well -- we understand that georgian police have detained a person late wednesday suspected of throwing that live grenade during a rally where president bush was speaking. %$* 307
as you may recall, this was actually back in may, this from the interior ministry, as well as cnn confirming those facts. %$* 307
we understand that the capture followed a shootout in a village outside of the capital, tbilisi, in georgia, in which one policeman was killed, another wounded, that according to the ministry spokesman there. %$* 307
we are seeing images taken from a.p. %$* 307
and tv grabs of that -- perhaps of that suspect there. %$* 307
but again, cnn confirming and georgian officials also saying that they have detained a person late today here suspected of throwing that live grenade at the president when he was speaking during his trip in georgia. %$* 307
as soon as we have more information, we'll get that to you, as well. %$* 307
now back to inside politics. %$* 307
instead of harsh words, the rollout of president bush's supreme court nominee has been highlighted by smiling faces and a lot of democrats keeping their powder dry. %$* 307
it's a far cry from what could have been and what had been two decades ago. %$* 307
our senior political analyst bill schneider considers why john roberts is no robert bork. %$* 307
here's how one expert sizes up the stakes in the supreme court battle. %$* 317
we really haven't seen a swing vote of this magnitude retire since lewis powell in 1987. %$* 717
and you remember what happened then. %$* 717
then came a huge fight over robert bork's nomination. %$* 317
bork lost. %$* 317
john roberts is supposed to be the un-bork. %$* 317
john roberts is a very difficult target for the democrats to get much traction against. %$* 717
bork came across as a radical conservative. %$* 317
in robert bork's america, there is no room at the inn for blacks and no place in the constitution for women. %$* 324
and in our america, there should be no seat on the supreme court for robert bork. %$* 324
roberts is being labeled an establishment conservative. %$* 317
i always got a lump in my throat whenever i walked up to those marble steps to argue a case before the court. %$* 405
what kind of court do americans want, more conservative or more liberal? %$* 317
more conservative beats more liberal, 41 to 30 percent. %$* 317
but 25 percent of the country want to keep the court just as it is now. %$* 317
add them in, and you get 66 percent who don't want a more liberal court and 55 percent who don't want a more conservative court. %$* 317
a slightly more conservative court looks ok; a radically more conservative court, no. %$* 317
roberts' supporters say no bork he. %$* 317
he is a mainstream conservative. %$* 507
his critics, like moveon.org, say instead of a mainstream jurist, bush chose another right-wing crony. %$* 317
in other words, he borked. %$* 317
bork or un-bork? %$* 317
here's what senator kennedy says. %$* 317
what all americans deserve to know is whether judge roberts respects the core values of the constitution and falls within the conservative mainstream of america, along the lines of justice sandra day o'connor. %$* 324
that is the issue. %$* 324
in other words, we'll see. %$* 317
in 2000, roberts made these comments to the "baltimore sun" about the rehnquist court. %$* 317
quote, "the conventional wisdom is that this is a conservative court. %$* 317
we have to take that more skeptically." %$* 317
roberts went on, quote, "of the three issues the public was most interested in, school prayer, abortion, and miranda rights, the conservatives lost on all." %$* 317
sounds like someone who would like to see the court move to the right. %$* 317
bill schneider, thank you very much. %$* 307
now, earlier in the program, we heard from democratic senator patrick leahy. %$* 307
a short time ago, i spoke with republican senator sam brownback, who is also a member of the judiciary committee. %$* 307
i started by asking brownback that, given roberts' limited paper trail as a judge, is there a risk for conservatives that he might be more moderate than most people believe? %$* 307
well, that's an area of concern. %$* 513
and i wish we had somebody in that setting, in that sense, that we knew more about their view of the constitution and its meaning and the court's role in the society. %$* 513
we don't have that. %$* 513
we clearly have a brilliant jurist. %$* 513
this gentleman is brilliant. %$* 513
he's a great lawyer. %$* 513
he's argued a number of cases in front of the supreme court, harvard law school, harvard undergraduate, brilliant gentleman. %$* 513
what i hope we can find out during the hearing process is his view of the constitution. %$* 513
is it a living document that changes, or is it a set document by its text? %$* 513
that's what i'm interested in. %$* 513
and how do you get to those answers? %$* 307
well, i think you really ask the question basically that way. %$* 513
you don't ask people about roe versus wade. %$* 513
you don't ask people about property rights cases that might come in front of them. %$* 513
but you ask them, "what is your view of the constitution and the role of the courts in enforcing this constitution?" %$* 513
and you really try to get their view of how they see that constitutional document. %$* 513
now, let's talk about roe v. wade, because you recently chaired the first of several senate hearings evaluating the ramification of that. %$* 307
in a recent cnn-"usa today"-gallup poll showing 68 percent of americans say that the supreme court should not overturn roe v. wade. %$* 307
how much do you think abortion is going to play into these hearings? %$* 307
it will play into it, because it's the lead social issue of our day from both sides. %$* 513
but i think one ought to back up on it and say, "instead of looking at abortion, let's look at the constitution. %$* 513
what's in the constitution?" %$* 513
and let's look and examine that for the topic, because that's really the issue here, and the role of the courts in the country today, rather than honing in on this particular issue or privacy issue, all of which the nominee is not going to answer these questions, because that would be to prejudge a case. %$* 513
and that would be inappropriate for us to ask. %$* 513
now, obviously, this is going to be a battle. %$* 307
because we have already heard from senator reid. %$* 307
he said, "clearly, a judicial nominee should not comment on pending cases. %$* 307
but there are many other questions that a nominee should answer." %$* 307
and he goes on to say, "i encourage judge roberts to be forthcoming in responding to the committee's questions, providing written materials requested by the senators and so forth." %$* 307
do you think that roberts should be expected to answer at least some of those sensitive questions on issues like abortion during these hearings? %$* 307
well, did ruth bader ginsburg answer those questions? %$* 513
i've looked early at the transcript and she did not. %$* 513
she replaced byron white, who was a dissenter on roe, and here was ruth bader ginsburg who was, at the time, a lawyer for the aclu. %$* 513
she didn't respond to those questions. %$* 513
you can ask all those questions. %$* 513
it's fine to do that. %$* 513
but if people look at the past and they project into the future, nominees have never answered that specific prejudging a hypothetical question. %$* 513
they're not going to do that. %$* 513
they haven't in the past; they shouldn't now. %$* 513
now, of course, many people have been talking about the possibility of a filibuster here. %$* 307
many members of your party said they don't believe the filibuster will be used. %$* 307
but we heard from senator schumer who said that he would not rule it out, necessarily. %$* 307
is this a concern for republicans that could be a option? %$* 307
it's very much a concern that it's an option, because that then raises the bar from 51 votes to 60 votes to approve a nominee, which we've never had that in the history of the republic on a judge. %$* 513
the bar should be 51 votes, a majority of the people in the united states senate. %$* 513
and i think a filibuster would be just simply wrong. %$* 513
this is not an extraordinary circumstance. %$* 513
this is a highly qualified nominee. %$* 513
you may disagree with him. %$* 513
you may agree with him. %$* 513
but it should be a vote, and it should be a majority vote. %$* 513
now, the battle that may or may not lie ahead in the senate will depend to a large degree on judge roberts' past writings and rulings. %$* 307
as our bruce morton explains, roberts' paper trail may be thin, but it has several main points of interest. %$* 307
where does he stand on the issues? %$* 321
let's start with abortion. %$* 321
as deputy solicitor general, he co-authored a brief which said, quote, "we continue to believe that roe," the decision legalizing abortion, "was wrongly decided and should be overruled. %$* 321
the court's conclusion that there is a fundamental right to an abortion finds no support in the text, structure or history of the constitution," unquote. %$* 321
but at his confirmation hearing for the court of appeals in 2003, he said he'd been arguing the government's point of view, adding, quote, "roe v. wade is the settled law of the land. %$* 321
there's nothing in my personal views that would prevent me from fully and faithfully applying that precedent," unquote. %$* 321
in a case involving the arroyo toad, he wrote that the, quote, "hapless toad, for reasons of its own, lives its entire life in california," unquote, and therefore could not be protected by the interstate commerce clause of the constitution. %$* 321
then there was the 12-year-old girl arrested, searched and handcuffed by police in washington, d.c., subway system for eating one french fry. %$* 321
quote, "the district court subscribed the policies that led to her arrest as foolish," unquote. %$* 321
he wrote, "and, indeed, the policies were changed after those responsible endured the sort of publicity reserved for adults who make young girls cry. %$* 321
the question, however, is not whether these policies were a bad idea but whether they violated the fourth and fifth amendments to the constitution. %$* 321
we conclude that they did not," unquote. %$* 321
he was part of a three-judge panel that ruled unanimously that military tribunals set up to try terrorism suspects were legal and that the geneva convention did not apply to people the government labels "enemy combatants." %$* 321
and lastly, he said this during his confirmation hearing for the court of appeals. %$* 321
there's no role for advocacy, with respect to personal beliefs or views on the part of a judge. %$* 405
the judge is bound to follow the supreme court precedent, whether he agrees with it or disagrees with it, and bound to apply the rule of law in cases whether there's applicable supreme court precedent or not. %$* 405
personal views, personal ideology -- those have no role to play whatever. %$* 405
as for gay rights, no paper trail that we know of. %$* 321
but this is just the start. %$* 321
there will be many questions. %$* 321
bruce morton, cnn, washington. %$* 321
and members of the senate may not be rushing to judgment about roberts, but some interest groups are. %$* 307
up next, we'll hear from both sides in the unfolding fight for and against roberts' nomination. %$* 307
also ahead, supreme showdown or supreme letdown? %$* 307
the prospects for a peaceful d.c. summer in our "strategy session." %$* 307
and in an instant, john roberts became a big man in the blogosphere. %$* 307
we'll plug into the confirmation debate online. %$* 307
political interest groups, both in favor and against the john roberts' nomination, have already sprung into action. %$* 307
abortion rights protestors marched today in front of the supreme court. %$* 307
the national organization for women and naral pro-choice america were quick to announce their opposition to the roberts nomination. %$* 307
the left-leaning people for the american way is also raising concerns. %$* 307
the group's president says, quote, "replacing o'connor with someone who is not committed to upholding americans' rights, liberties, and legal protections would be a constitutional catastrophe." %$* 307
the organized effort to support john roberts is also up and running. %$* 307
the group progress for america plans to spend a million dollars over the next week airing this tv ad on cable news outlets nationwide. %$* 307
colleagues call him brilliant and praise his integrity and fair-mindedness. %$* 116
now president bush has nominated roberts for the supreme court. %$* 116
shouldn't a fair judge be treated fairly? %$* 116
urge the senate to give john roberts a fair up-or-down vote. %$* 116
now, with me now, representatives from two of the groups we just heard from. %$* 307
ralph neas is the president of the people for the american way and ben ginsberg is legal adviser to progress for america. %$* 307
already, in the commercial break, there was a little mud- slinging. %$* 307
i'm not going to allow too much of that here. %$* 307
but obviously, this is a very, very big battle ahead for everyone involved. %$* 307
ben, i will start with you. %$* 307
you've worked with roberts. %$* 307
what do you know about him that perhaps we have not read in the papers this morning, that we've seen on his exposes in the last 12 hours? %$* 307
well, he's the perfect choice for this job. %$* 583
and in a way, he's the left's worse nightmare. %$* 583
he has a distinguished career. %$* 583
he's practiced before the supreme court, argued 39 times before them. %$* 583
he really is the best and brightest of his generation. %$* 583
he has a mainstream philosophy and mainstream writings. %$* 583
and the truth of the matter is he is precisely the type of person who should be serving on the supreme court. %$* 583
all right, ralph, i take it that you disagree here. %$* 307
but i want to talk about the reaction here from the democrats, from the senators. %$* 307
some say really it was kind of almost molasses slow. %$* 307
did you not have that declarative statement of, "this is somebody that we cannot accept here. %$* 307
we don't see anything particularly in his record that we are going to basically bark about at this time." %$* 307
is this a democratic strategy here? %$* 307
"let's wait and see, let's dig up, see what we can get," or is just the fact is that you just don't have much? %$* 307
people for the american way has not yet taken a position on the roberts nomination. %$* 415
we've asked the senators, republicans and democrats, to withhold judgment, not to take a position until after the senate judiciary committee hearings. %$* 415
and the more we learn about john roberts, his likeability is apparent. %$* 415
he's got fine legal skills. %$* 415
it's his judicial philosophy that we want to find out about. %$* 415
the more we learn, i'm afraid he could be an antonin scalia in sheep's clothing. %$* 415
and we're afraid that, rather than being like a mainstream conservative like sandra o'connor, he could have the judicial philosophy of clarence thomas and antonin scalia. %$* 415
and if they get one or two more like-minded colleagues, more than 100 supreme court precedents would be overturned going back to 1937, affecting equal opportunity, affecting consumer issues, privacy issues, reproductive rights and the environment. %$* 415
so we have got to find out, what is his judicial philosophy? %$* 415
the burden is on him to prove to the american people and to the united states senate that he's a mainstream conservative. %$* 415
and i hope that he'll produce evidence to that. %$* 415
and of course, there's a loss of a paper trail. %$* 415
just like justice rehnquist, he should be able to give up his documents from his tenure at the white house and at the department of justice. %$* 415
ben, is he another scalia here? %$* 307
because, obviously, when it seems to me as if he is not really even inspiring those on the ultra-right side here, that you don't have that kind of like, you know, blood-thirsty, let's-go kind of battle that's ensuing. %$* 307
and a lot of people were thinking that that was what was going to happen here. %$* 307
there seems almost to be a certain consensus that's developing. %$* 307
at least we're seeing it on the hill. %$* 307
yes, i think that's absolutely true. %$* 583
and don't forget, just 20 months ago, john roberts was confirmed unanimously by the senate to the court of appeals, where they had a chance to look at his judicial philosophy, his writings, and his career. %$* 583
and that was a unanimous vote. %$* 583
now, unfortunately, where i think ralph is suggesting this process go is a series of litmus tests about a nominee. %$* 583
and that's unfortunate, because... %$* 583
is that what you're taking about? %$* 307
no, not at all. %$* 415
not at all. %$* 415
well, it can lead to a bunch of whole issues. %$* 583
and that was kind of you're either with us or not... %$* 583
that doesn't sound like a litmus test to me, ben. %$* 415
it sounds like a judicial philosophy. %$* 415
well, i think, ralph, that's not the case, because, on the judicial philosophy, you now have the members of the senate agreeing that extraordinary circumstances are the grounds for filibustering a nominee, if that's your next tactic. %$* 583
i don't think you can go there with john roberts. %$* 583
and that's why you're hearing... %$* 583
are there extraordinary circumstances in this case for a filibuster? %$* 307
very importantly, robert bork was unanimously approved for the circuit court of appeals, just like john roberts, and then was defeated 58-42 when he was up for the supreme court in 1987. %$* 415
with respect to extraordinary circumstances, only the 14 senators who signed that memorandum of understanding on may 23rd know what that means. %$* 415
we do know that 20 percent, more than 20 percent, of all supreme court nominees have been rejected, 60 percent of them without even a vote. %$* 415
there have been three filibusters against supreme court justices since 1968, the successful one against abe fortas, where he had 51 votes supporting him, and two unsuccessful filibusters against rehnquist in '72 and 1986. %$* 415
that's the history of the senate. %$* 415
so that, i would assume, would constitute the circumstances that the senators are talking about. %$* 415
but only they know for sure. %$* 415
it's really premature to start talking about a filibuster. %$* 415
let's have the senate judiciary hearings. %$* 415
they're always the most crucial part of the confirmation process. %$* 415
with all due respect to ben and myself, it's important to have this national dialogue and national debate to tell people what's at stake. %$* 415
there's been a lot of talk about his record. %$* 307
but of course, one thing is, he's an establishment candidate. %$* 307
and that can be taken in a good way. %$* 307
he is well-liked in washington by democrats and republicans. %$* 307
and so obviously, that is going to be a point, as well. %$* 307
i have to thank you both. %$* 307
we're running out of time. %$* 307
great to be here. %$* 415
thank you. %$* 583
thank you again, ralph neas, ben ginsberg. %$* 307
no surprise what is leading the discussions on the internet. %$* 307
up next, our blog reporters will tell us how the john roberts nomination is being received in the blogosphere. %$* 307
the john roberts' nomination is a hot topic in the blogosphere. %$* 307
we check in now with cnn political producer abbi tatton and jacki schechner, our blog reporter -- jacki? %$* 307
hey, suzanne. %$* 325
the sheer volume of information posted about john roberts in such a short period of time is absolutely astounding. %$* 325
we have that sentiment over at myopiczeal.blogsome.com. %$* 325
eric saying, "everyone has an opinion." %$* 325
he went to bed early last night, posted at 7 o'clock this morning, noting that the amount of commentary already written by that time was incredible. %$* 325
there were many roundups out there on the conservative side. %$* 384
what is the right saying? %$* 384
it's by-and-large very, very positive today. %$* 384
blogsforbush.com has a great long list of conservative bloggers weighing in. %$* 384
volokh.com, d.c. law professor calling this decision "inspired." %$* 384
iowavoice.com, for example, "i don't think the president could have made a better choice." %$* 384
when conservative columnist ann coulter earlier on today said that maybe this wasn't the best pick for a nominee -- she said, "a souter in roberts' clothing, perhaps" -- many of the right bloggers started thinking about this, weighing in, and seemed to disagree with her, powerline blog being one of them. %$* 384
you're seeing on the right a kind of collective sigh of relief. %$* 384
there's been a lot of concern with the conservative bloggers that bush's pick would be a moderate. %$* 384
a lot of worry about alberto gonzales. %$* 384
and today, it seems like a pleasant surprise, and that's summed up nicely at right wing news. %$* 384
what they say is, "i feel like a little kid who got a puppy, a b.b. %$* 384
gun, and a bike for christmas when he was just expecting another sweater." %$* 384
but what if it was a really nice sweater? %$* 325
i would have taken the sweater. %$* 325
something on the left that we're starting to see, this meme developing of a partisan hack. %$* 325
mydd.com -- this is a progressive blog -- chris bowers posting, "one partisan hack for another," and essentially saying that the bush administration was picked by the supreme court and now they're taking somebody who's part of the bush campaign team and putting him on the supreme court to take attention away from the head of the president bush campaign team, karl rove. %$* 325
but not all on the left saying that. %$* 325
a lot of people saying, "hold on. %$* 325
slow down. %$* 325
we don't really know that much about him just yet." %$* 325
jeralyn merritt at talkleft.com is one of those people, saying she "doesn't know much about roberts. %$* 325
it's not good to come out swinging this early on. %$* 325
it's going to make it seem like they would have countered anyone president bush up. %$* 325
wait and see what we know, then we'll post more about it. %$* 325
don't distract from other stories out there." %$* 325
and that's the sentiment that's echoed over the popular blog dailykos.com, the most heavily trafficked blog on the left out there, where kos himself was weighing in and saying, "take a breath. %$* 384
we don't know enough right now. %$* 384
we're willing to hear roberts out on this one," saying that, "for all we know, and for all the religious right knows at this point, roberts might be an o'connor-style moderate conservative." %$* 384
and one thing we'd be remiss that we didn't mention that is coming up right now is how attractive john roberts is. %$* 325
over at the moderate voice, greg piper posting, "john roberts, judicial heartthrob," pointing out, "what says america more than the name 'john roberts'? %$* 325
for god's sake, he could have been a pilgrim." %$* 325
and over at underneaththeirrobes.blogs.com, at one point they named him the number-five super hottie of the federal judiciary. %$* 325
not an official poll, but one that they took very seriously -- suzanne? %$* 325
very serious, indeed. %$* 307
abbi, jacki, thank you very much. %$* 307
now, up next here on inside politics, will the choice of a conservative judge for the supreme court lead to a bruising confirmation fight? %$* 307
we'll take a look in our "strategy session." %$* 307
welcome back to inside politics. %$* 307
the selection of john roberts as the nominee for the supreme court tops our "strategy session" today. %$* 307
democratic strategist donna brazile is here as well as former pentagon spokeswoman tori clarke. %$* 307
thank you very much, both for being here. %$* 307
today, of course, the president makes a conservative choice for the high court. %$* 307
senators on both sides of the aisle gear up for the confirmation fight. %$* 307
and interest groups want to make sure their voices are heard. %$* 307
president bush says he has chosen one of the best legal minds of his generation to fill an opening on the u.s. supreme court. %$* 307
the president shared his choice with the nation in a prime-time -- last night -- address introducing federal judge john roberts. %$* 307
if confirmed by the senate, roberts would replace retiring justice sandra day o'connor. %$* 307
the process that the president says he hopes will happen quickly. %$* 307
speaking in baltimore today, the president gave strong support for the man he believes is a good choice. %$* 307
he's somebody americans will be proud to have seated on that bench. %$* 161
he has the qualities that our country expects in a judge: experience, wisdom, fairness and civility. %$* 161
he has profound respect for the rule of law. %$* 161
he has respect for the liberties guaranteed to every single citizen. %$* 161
he will strictly apply the constitution and laws. %$* 161
he will not legislate from the bench. %$* 161
now sandra day o'connor today said, you know, a great choice. %$* 307
the only thing was wrong was he wasn't a man. %$* 307
are you ladies -- are you disappointed by that? %$* 307
i was. %$* 567
i'll tell you, she said in this statement, i guess she was out fishing in spokane, washington. %$* 567
not catching any fish. %$* 505
well, not catching any. %$* 567
but she said the president said he would cast a wide net clearly came up short when it came to the selection in terms of the gender. %$* 567
you know, she said that the court now is reduced by -- the number of women on the court reduced by 50 percent. %$* 567
and she said that she was disappointed, although she said that he was a good candidate. %$* 567
look, i was disappointed. %$* 567
i thought the president would, in fact, select a woman, a minority. %$* 567
after all, we've had 109 justices. %$* 567
only four have been nonwhite males. %$* 567
it would have been a great selection. %$* 567
we knew that the president would select a conservative. %$* 567
and the only thing that would distinguish between him and the other jurists is that he's a younger conservative in my judgment. %$* 567
tory, let me -- just kind of scenario here, because some people say look, if you were looking at a company, a ceo was essentially going to look for an opening, interviewed a whole bunch of candidates, black, hispanic, women and then turns around and says well, you know, the most qualified candidate is this white male over here. %$* 307
and that's who we're going with. %$* 307
people would cry foul. %$* 307
they'd say, wait a minute, this is an old boy establishment. %$* 307
the network promoting this kind of thing. %$* 307
why shouldn't people see it that way? %$* 307
or should they? %$* 307
well, i think some people are disappointed. %$* 505
i think some people look at it that cynically. %$* 505
i wonder if the president himself told mrs. bush he was not picking a woman, or did he get a staffer to do that. %$* 505
but i think, people may be disappointed it's not a woman or a minority, but they can't be disappointed in the process. %$* 505
he did look at a white range of people, all sizes and shapes and colors and genders, and came up with the choice that he thinks is the most qualified person, which at the end of the day, is what's important. %$* 505
i think it's also likely he's got another pick before his administration is over, president bush does, and it puts more pressure and more interest on that spot for who he might appoint for that. %$* 505
let's talk about the hot issue, of course, which is abortion. %$* 307
i want to actually show the viewers a couple of things, a statement that he made back in 1990. %$* 307
"he says we continue to believe that roe was wrongly decided and should be overruled." %$* 307
and then, of course, in his confirmation hearing in april of 2003, he makes the statement that roe v wade is the settled law of the land. %$* 307
we've learned a lot more about him in the last 12 hours. %$* 307
we know he's roman catholic. %$* 307
we know that his wife is a part of a group, a pro-life organization here. %$* 307
what does that say about the candidate? %$* 307
how important is that going to be in this confirmation? %$* 307
i think it's going to be one of many issues that gets scrutinized when members of the senate judiciary committee sit and talk to him about his views. %$* 567
i mean, will he come before the judiciary committee with his previous views on abortion, that abortion rights should be overturned? %$* 567
or will he come with his current views that it's settled law? %$* 567
we should find out during the confirmation process. %$* 567
malveaux:  tori, what does he have to say to satisfy the conservatives? %$* 567
oh, i think this will be the no. %$* 505
1 issue. %$* 505
and i think what's fascinating is the debate will be over what's appropriate in the debate. %$* 505
and you're already starting to see the forces line up. %$* 505
what is appropriate for him to discuss and comment on and what's not. %$* 505
and if he's smart, he's going to employ the ruth bader ginsberg strategy, which is to not speculate about these things, not talk about things in a way that might come before his review if he's a nominee. %$* 505
it worked for her. %$* 505
it should work for him. %$* 505
and much has been made about the fact that there's not much of a paper trail here. %$* 307
and people are saying it's going to work in the democrat's favor, because -- well, not work in the democrats favor, because rather, they're not going to be able to really pinpoint to anything specifically and say we object, here's where we draw the line. %$* 307
but there are some republicans who are also concerned that perhaps he's not the conservative that they think. %$* 307
perhaps he's a little bit more moderate. %$* 307
and they just don't know. %$* 307
they don't have anything to go on. %$* 307
will that hurt the conservatives, as well? %$* 307
nature abhors a vacuum. %$* 505
and a lot of people have a certain information vacuum right now. %$* 505
some on the far left, some on the far right are already starting to paint the picture. %$* 505
they're wrong to do it, because there should be a full and fair and complete review of him and his background, his qualifications, and ought to be done in a very civil way. %$* 505
then they can decide. %$* 505
but not start to speculate this early on. %$* 505
well, the president has done his job in nominated mr. roberts. %$* 567
now it's time for the senate to do their homework. %$* 567
i mean, that's their job to advise and consent. %$* 567
and to go and to deeply probe into all of his record, not just his record on the court, the d.c. court. %$* 567
that's a small record, but he also has the 39 cases that he tried. %$* 567
i mean, was he basically hired help, or did he agree with some of the views of his clients? %$* 567
we need to find out a little bit more about mr. roberts. %$* 567
and we'll talk about that on the other end of this commercial break. %$* 307
john roberts' nomination to the supreme court should be taken up by the senate judiciary committee in late august or early september. %$* 307
will, democrats on the committee split with republicans over roberts' conservative credentials? %$* 307
that's up next in our "strategy session." %$* 307
stay with us. %$* 307
the "strategy session" continues now on inside politics, with us donna brazile and tory clarke. %$* 307
judge john roberts was on capitol hill today giving the senators who will vote on his confirmation a closer look. %$* 307
there has already been strong support for the nominee from republican senators. %$* 307
democrats haven't been negative, but they are parsing their comments more carefully. %$* 307
we're getting brand new video here now. %$* 307
this of course, senator patrick leahy meeting with judge roberts here, one of the many meetings that he's had on capitol hill this morning and this afternoon. %$* 307
the two of them close there. %$* 307
we have been told by our producer that he is actually talking with leahy, telling him a little bit about how he thought -- the kids thought how cool it was to be at the white house. %$* 307
we've seen some of that video before, rather rambunctious son and the daughter by his wife's side. %$* 307
the two of them obviously sharing a moment there. %$* 307
i want to ask, you know, there seems to me as if democrats, we haven't heard the kind of language that we expected even from senator kennedy, people coming out very strongly with objections here. %$* 307
why is that? %$* 307
is that strategy? %$* 307
we're waiting, we're stepping back here, or we've just don't have what we need to put out a full force attack. %$* 307
now remember, some of these democrats like chuck schumer,  ted kennedy, they're on the judiciary committee, joe biden. %$* 567
they're going to raise these issues inside the judiciary committee. %$* 567
they're going to raise these questions not before the hearing process, but they're going to try to set, what i call the parameters of the debate. %$* 567
will he protect and defend individual rights and liberties and freedoms? %$* 567
and they will look at, again, some of his past cases to see if he falls within, what i call the judicial mainstream. %$* 567
but i looked at ted kennedy's remarks today and i thought they were pretty good. %$* 567
i think the senators so far are holding their fire. %$* 505
and i think it's smart strategically. %$* 505
i also think it's the right behavior. %$* 505
what's interesting is the two first sound bites i heard this morning were from democrats. %$* 505
jim moran, very liberal congressman from here in northern virginia, praising john roberts, and then bob bennett, former counselor for president clinton, praising john roberts, saying this would be an excellent choice. %$* 505
and one of the most interesting things about this fellow, about whom we're all learning, is the number of democratic friends he has who are coming out of the woodwork to say what a great guy he is. %$* 505
now let's talk about his role in the election 2000 florida recount. %$* 307
he was really pivotal behind that decision. %$* 307
we know, of course, bush got into office after that. %$* 307
how damaging is that, that played such a role? %$* 307
is that really going to be politically -- %$* 307
well, i raised it early on last night when i saw david boies who argued on the gore side, talk about him. %$* 567
david boies knew him and david boies talked about his approach to the law, and while david boies disagreed with him, david boies, i thought, gave an excellent, you know, it sounded like an excellent presentation on why we should wait to hear all his views. %$* 567
look, in addition to bush v gore, which of course i strongly disagreed with -- %$* 567
i'm shocked. %$* 505
brazile:  don't let the word go out. %$* 505
but we also have to look at his opinions on voting rights, a lot of voting rights cases come before the supreme court. %$* 505
his position on, i don't want to sound like a litmus test, but race has been an issue that's been before the court in the past, especially the supreme court, and we need to probe all of his views on race, on voting rights, in particular, and, of course, on protecting individual rights and freedoms. %$* 505
right. %$* 505
and as much as much as i think the number one issue will be abortion, every one of these other items, it's just been sort of in passing in the initial coverage, is going to get a lot of scrutiny, as it should. %$* 505
the key question is how the process is conducted. %$* 505
ok.  we'll get back in a moment. %$* 307
they don't have an official rule to advise or consent, but interest groups are very interested in the selection of john roberts for the supreme court, and they're going out of their way to make sure everyone knows it. %$* 307
that's next on the "strategy session." %$* 307
i'm wolf blitzer reporting from washington. %$* 142
coming up at the top of the hour, washington reacts to the president's choice for the u.s. supreme court. %$* 142
can john roberts be confirmed? %$* 142
thousands of children are starving to death in northern africa. %$* 142
why some say the west is at least partially to blame. %$* 142
and it's a nuclear power in one of the most unstable parts of the world. %$* 142
what does the future hold for india? %$* 142
my exclusive interview with prime minister manmohan singh. %$* 142
all those stories, much more only minutes away on "wolf blitzer reports." %$* 142
now back to inside politics. %$* 142
the strategy session continues on inside politics. %$* 307
donna brazile and tory clarke. %$* 307
the abortion rights group naral, came out against the roberts nomination even before president bush made his announcement last night. %$* 307
and as we reported earlier, progress for america says it's going to spend millions of dollars on tv ads and other efforts to support the choice of roberts. %$* 307
just how much impact will outside groups have on the confirmation process? %$* 307
what was very interesting here is that both sides really stand to gain if this person is -- well if you throw red meat and people go running, here. %$* 307
the fact that that has not happened, both sides tend to lose money. %$* 307
i mean, that is the bottom line, the honest truth. %$* 307
both of those groups tend to lose money here. %$* 307
is this a good thing? %$* 307
well, they have a war room set up i'm sure, on both sides of the political equation. %$* 567
the right will have their war rooms to support this candidate and to make sure that he gets through the senate and of course, the left will have their war room to deeply probe the record and to find out if there's anything in his background that would cause alarm or cause him to be "borked," so to speak. %$* 567
so, i think -- look, i think one of the sleeper issues that we didn't mention in the last segment is the environment. %$* 567
i mean, he has made some controversial statements on the environment, on the endangered species act, on allowing coal companies to strip mountaintops. %$* 567
that's going to be a sleeper issue. %$* 567
so -- and pretty soon you'll hear from all of these groups on both the left and the right. %$* 567
separation of church -- there's just so much that people will jump up and shout about. %$* 567
and tori, let's talk about strategy real quick, because these ads have come out and we have a poll here that shows that ad campaigns -- whether or not they influence the choice of the next supreme court justice:  helpful, 39 percent say "yes," but harmful, that's 54 percent. %$* 307
sure. %$* 505
all of this money being put out there in the last 24 hours. %$* 307
how effective is that as a strategy? %$* 307
well, i think it's to be determined. %$* 505
i think people are increasingly skeptical and cynical about the role of these advocacy groups on both sides. %$* 505
i think the good news is:  these advocacy groups are going to be under a lot of scrutiny. %$* 505
not as much as the nominee, but a lot of scrutiny, which is a good thing. %$* 505
so, how they behave, how they execute their strategies will come under a lot of intense scrutiny. %$* 505
i think that's a very, very good thing. %$* 505
they ought to be. %$* 505
i find it a little distressing -- tens-of- millions of dollars. %$* 505
i mean we'll never know the real figure, but there's going to be so much money spent on this for rhetoric that was written before the nominee was even named. %$* 505
it's all about the first amendment and these groups love to talk. %$* 567
they love to organize and they're in the business of agitating just about everybody. %$* 567
and they've managed to do that. %$* 307
i get it from both sides. %$* 567
i get the blogs. %$* 567
i get the material. %$* 567
i guess the press releases. %$* 567
they're ready. %$* 567
they're ready. %$* 567
they're locked and loaded and ready for battle. %$* 567
well, we'll see if it pays off. %$* 307
thank you very much, both of you, for joining us today. %$* 307
thank you. %$* 505
thank you. %$* 567
he is no longer the lead story, but he has not been forgotten. %$* 307
up next, bloggers are still debating karl rove and the cia leak story. %$* 307
we'll rejoin our blog reporters next. %$* 307
the john roberts' nomination was not the only topic on capitol hill today. %$* 307
senators heard testimony on a proposed federal shield law that would protect journalists who use confidential sources. %$* 307
cnn's kathleen koch has more. %$* 307
last week before the grand jury probing the valerie plame leak case, "time" magazine correspondent matt cooper was a reluctant witness. %$* 718
but wednesday, he was eager to tell senators, journalists need a federal shield law, so they can't be forced to break their promise of confidentiality. %$* 718
right now, if i pick up the phone and call a senator or his or her staff or a civil servant and they say "don't quote me on this, but..." or "don't identify me, but..."  i can't really know what i'm getting into. %$* 0
both the house and the senate are considering bills to create a federal law preventing reporters from being compelled to identify their sources. %$* 718
the justice department, in written testimony, opposed that warning quote, "the bill would create serious impediments to the department's ability to effectively enforce the law and fight terrorism." %$* 718
lawmakers sponsoring the measure made a last-minute change to address that concern. %$* 718
under our revised bill, a reporter could not be compelled to reveal a source unless the disclosure of the identity of a source is necessary to prevent imminent or actual harm to national security. %$* 125
some worry that would give the federal government too much leeway. %$* 718
the government for its own purposes, can brand it national security when it shouldn't be. %$* 21
thirty-one states now have shield laws guarding a reporter's right to keep a source confidential. %$* 718
witnesses insisted the nation will suffer if sources are increasingly afraid to come forward. %$* 718
serious journalism would virtually cease to exist, in my view. %$* 516
wrong-doing would not be uncovered. %$* 516
we would never have learned about the crimes known as watergate or the massive fraud called enron. %$* 516
one columnist said the jailing of his colleague "new york times" reporter judith miller was already having a chilling effect on his statements about federal prosecutors. %$* 718
because any harsh criticism of them from me might we'll be taken out on her, i am constrained to speak gently, as if concerned about the treatment of a hostage. %$* 719
some had hoped the high-profile leak case would put a federal shield law on the fast track, but most now admit its progress will be slowed as lawmakers focus on the new supreme court nominee. %$* 720
kathleen koch, cnn, capitol hill. %$* 720
karl rove is out of the spotlight, but he's still a big topic for left-leaning bloggers. %$* 307
let's rejoin cnn political producer abbi tatton and jacki schechner, our blog reporter -- jacki? %$* 307
suzanne, that's just what they're saying, "keep it in the spotlight." %$* 325
"let's not let the valarie plame affair and karl rove's role in it, slip out of the mainstream media's attention." %$* 325
over at "bringiton"  -- this is the unitedamerican.blogs.com , they're calling it the "political shell game," saying, "it's all going to move very, very fast. %$* 325
keep your eye on the ball. %$* 325
don't let this one slip away." %$* 325
someone else saying that, is "additurk" at risinghedgeman.blogspot.com . %$* 325
"keep our eye on the ball," that, "the bush administration is on the ropes because of karl rove and the policy of deceit and this is what they need to pay attention to." %$* 325
and pushing this story ahead for the liberal bloggers today, is an article published in the "american prospect." %$* 384
"that's an unlikely story." %$* 384
you can see here from memorandum.com , lots of people linking to it. %$* 384
in that article, it's suggested that karl rove in an initial meeting with the fbi, did not disclose discussions he'd had with "time" magazine's matt cooper. %$* 384
liberal bloggers jumping all over this. %$* 384
this is digbysblog.blogspot.com . %$* 384
in a post entitled "oops," what he's saying is, "well, this is the kind of thing that got martha stewart in trouble, " wondering if karl rove is going to be knitting any ponchos anytime soon." %$* 384
but as you mentioned before, something else you're seeing from the left is this walk-and-chew-gum for the mainstream media. %$* 384
they want to keep it in the spotlight. %$* 384
yes, the supreme court nomination is very, very important, but so is the karl rove story. %$* 384
we're seeing that over at "dailykos" as well, saying that progressive bloggers are able to do that, to keep more than one story alive at a time. %$* 325
they can walk and chew gum, they say. %$* 325
something else we wanted to show you -- a really cool visual over at "the whiskey bar." %$* 325
this is billmand.org . %$* 325
they put this together. %$* 325
it's a take-off on custard's last stand. %$* 325
they're calling it rove's last stand. %$* 325
i don't know if you can see it that clearly, but you've got karl rove in the middle and all of the big republican players scattered throughout the battlefield. %$* 325
suzanne, we will send it back to you. %$* 325
ok. %$* 307
thank you very much. %$* 307
and that is it for inside politics. %$* 307
i'm suzanne malveaux. %$* 307
"wolf blitzer reports" starts right now. %$* 307

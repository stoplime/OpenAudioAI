inside politics with john king starts right now. %$* 168
donald trump visits the u.s./mexico border. %$* 656
we have a tremendous danger on the border with the illegals coming in. %$* 5
our brand-new poll shows immigration is just one reason trump is a growing force in the republican race. %$* 53
i think i'll get the nomination. %$* 5
plus hillary clinton addresses race -- and justice. %$* 53
stand up and say, loudly, and clearly, "yes, black lives matter." %$* 149
while rival bernie sanders draws a contrast on the minimum wage. %$* 53
if you work 40 hours a week, you have a right not to be living in poverty. %$* 128
inside politics, the biggest stories sourced by the best reporters now. %$* 53
welcome to inside politics. %$* 53
i'm john king. %$* 53
thanks for sharing your %$* 53
sunday morning as we share with you some fascinating results from our brand-new cnn poll assessing the trump effect -- yes, the trump effect on the race for president. %$* 53
with us this morning to share their reporting and their insights, cnn's maeve reston, robert costa of the "washington post", cnn's nia- malika henderson, and lisa lerer of the associated press -- excuse me. %$* 53
if you thought donald trump was a passing fancy in the race for president, well think again. %$* 53
our brand new cnn/orc opinion research poll released just now finds a majority of republicans want mr. trump to stay in the gop race. %$* 53
this is interesting though -- one-third of republicans wish he would quit the race entirely. %$* 53
this one even more interesting -- 15 percent of republicans and gop-leaning independents prefer mr. trump not run as a republican, but as a third party candidate. %$* 53
figure that one out -- that despite strong evidence at least at the moment that an independent trump run would almost guarantee a democratic victory. %$* 53
our new data showed trump's best hope though is as a republican. %$* 53
and he seems to get that. %$* 53
a good slice of his support comes from his tough talk on immigration so it was off to the border this past week. %$* 53
then in iowa on saturday, trump launched at the man who throughout this summer has been leading the iowa polls, wisconsin governor scott walker. %$* 53
wisconsin's doing terribly. %$* 5
first of all, it's in turmoil. %$* 5
the schools are a disaster. %$* 5
and they're fighting like crazy because there's no money for the schools. %$* 5
the hospitals and education is a disaster. %$* 5
and he was totally in favor of common core. %$* 5
that against scott walker and after a midweek interview in which mr. trump threatened to mount a third party run if the gop establishment disrespected him, he seemed to correct course -- aware it seems his odds are best right where he is -- atop a crowded, messy, republican race. %$* 53
i'm a republican, i'm a conservative. %$* 5
i'm running, i'm in first place by a lot it seems according to all the polls. %$* 5
i want to run as a republican. %$* 5
i think i'll get the nomination. %$* 5
we'll see soon enough. %$* 5
but i think i'll get the nomination. %$* 5
all right. %$* 53
help me because we saw a different donald trump this week. %$* 53
he had the inflammatory language to start his campaign about mexican immigrants -- rapists and murders. %$* 53
he was at the border. %$* 53
if he wanted to amp up the rhetoric he could have. %$* 53
he didn't. %$* 53
he's talked about a wall in the past. %$* 53
he actually pulled back a little bit and said a wall in some places. %$* 53
then he starts the third party conversation, seems to realize it's getting out of hand, he says no, no, no. %$* 53
maybe down the road i'll change my mind but i have every intent of running as a republican. %$* 53
i think i can win. %$* 53
he sounded to me like a tactical, strategic politician. %$* 53
i think that's the question we are looking. %$* 143
can anyone actually whisper in the donald's ear and get him to course correct? %$* 143
but what's really interesting, particularly on the immigration rhetoric is that he has been in such a different place in the past on that issue. %$* 143
you saw a little bit of a softens this week where he talked about, you know, i saw some of the conservative blogs saying donald trump was open to amnesty which was a complete course correction from his announcement speech. %$* 143
so i think it will be really interesting to see what happens to his support. %$* 143
as people begin to discover and explore those positions that he's taken in the past, particularly on that issue. %$* 143
the key question for donald trump as with many things trump comes down to money, right? %$* 184
he's self-funding. %$* 184
he's paying for his bid. %$* 184
so the question is not even how much he's willing to spend -- right. %$* 184
he could kind of do this. %$* 184
he has very high name id. %$* 184
he doesn't really need to run ads. %$* 184
he could do it on the cheap for a presidential campaign which is still of course quite expensive. %$* 184
but it's how much he wants to lose. %$* 184
his money is coming, yes, in part from real estate deals. %$* 184
but it's coming from licensing his name. %$* 184
the value of his name is really, really important to his financial empire. %$* 184
so if these statements, if this presidential quest starts hurting the value of his brand, i think we're going to see him pull out of this race. %$* 184
so that's what you need to watch. %$* 184
it's already had some impact. %$* 184
that might be kind of why we've seen him moderate his tone -- right. %$* 173
right. %$* 184
because so far he's lost the macy's thing. %$* 173
he's had, you know, that restaurateur pull out. %$* 173
so certainly -- %$* 173
or is he moderating his tone because he's in first place? %$* 53
yes. %$* 173
i think it's -- right. %$* 173
forgive me. %$* 53
i know he cares about his brand. %$* 53
i know he cares about his name but let's give him some credit. %$* 53
he is leading the race right now, or is a factor in the race anyway. %$* 53
we're going to have brand new poll numbers, by the way, on "state of the union" coming up in just about half an hour to show you the horse race numbers but he's doing very well in the race. %$* 53
if you look at 17 candidates in the republican race, if he's getting in the high teens, around 20 percent, as long as that bunch stays in, you're winning states. %$* 53
i think one of the questions -- we're coming up on the first debate -- one of the questions is how long can he go without giving more detailed policy positions? %$* 53
because when you ask him specifics he often punts. %$* 53
listen to him here. %$* 53
in iowa yesterday when talking about how do you save social security in the long-term? %$* 53
and then at that border stop when he was asked specifically about the undocumented. %$* 53
bring back so much money, and make our country so rich and great again that i won't have to cut social security because i don't want to cut social security. %$* 5
and i'm the only one that can do that. %$* 5
what would you do with the 11 million undocumented immigrants who are already here? %$* 22
the first thing we have to do is strengthen our borders. %$* 5
and after that we're going to have plenty of time to talk about it. %$* 5
what should we do? %$* 22
how long can he get away with that? %$* 53
i get the idea if you create more jobs there's more tax revenue coming in to social security. %$* 53
but if you're looking 15, 20, 30 years down the line, social security is easier than medicare but you're still having to deal with questions do you raise the retirement age again or do you means-test benefits, of do you  some of them back? %$* 53
just creating jobs is not going to do it. %$* 53
for the undocumented, robert, i think even more importantly to a republican conservative base he needs an answer to that question. %$* 53
what do you do with the 11 million? %$* 53
he does. %$* 178
but it is still early in the race. %$* 178
and according to trump allies part of the reason they've had the certain tone this week is because they want to go into debate with the right standing. %$* 178
they want to make sure they're leading the polls and they want to give him an opportunity in the debate to unveil some specifics. %$* 178
i think you will see trump at that debate stage on august 6th come out with some specifics, but knowing trump as a tv mind he wants to do it with the biggest audience possible, not on the campaign trail. %$* 178
and so far all of the expectations we've had about trump, in some ways, have been wrong. %$* 797
i didn't think he'd ever run even though you were early out there saying that he would in the "post". %$* 797
people didn't think he'd release his financial statements. %$* 797
he did. %$* 797
people thought he'd take on some water with the john mccain thing. %$* 797
that didn't really happen at least according to some of these early polls. %$* 797
so he has, you know, defied a lot of the expectation so far. %$* 797
he's not going to quit. %$* 178
yes. %$* 173
i mean everyone thing he's going to quit. %$* 178
i've spoken with trump about this. %$* 178
he says "i'm 69 years old. %$* 178
i've waited my whole life to do this. %$* 178
i'm going to see it through." %$* 178
maybe it doesn't work out but i don't think he's going to quit because of brand-new reasons, because his kids are telling him to get out. %$* 178
those are factors and those may weigh on him. %$* 178
but i think he likes this. %$* 178
i just spoke the sentence "let's give him some credit". %$* 53
so a lot of our expectations have changed. %$* 53
let's look at the impact on the race because he is -- again in a crowded field like this when you have somebody come in and suck up all the oxygen it makes a huge impact. %$* 53
look at the polling when trump was just getting into the race and now and you could make the case that the people he's hurt the most at the moment. %$* 53
jeb bush is actually gone up a tiny little bit. %$* 53
but if you're marco rubio, scott walker or ted cruz your numbers this summer have gone down a little bit; other candidates as well. %$* 53
is there a potential that no matter what happens to trump, that he is dramatically, or is it or do we not know if it's dramatic or not affected the other guys? %$* 53
this is not good for the republican party. %$* 184
it's just not. %$* 184
he's sucking up all the oxygen in the room. %$* 184
when he was at the border marco rubio was fighting with john kerry on iran and jeb bush was in new hampshire and john kasich was meeting with mitt romney. %$* 184
you heard very little about any of that -- tight. %$* 184
this is an important period for those guys. %$* 184
they need to lay out an early message, right? %$* 184
they need to figure out who -- what or how they're presenting themselves to the american public. %$* 184
trump is just sucking up all the oxygen. %$* 184
and he's hurting the party. %$* 184
at the same time i think a lot of the strategists with rubio or jeb would say they don't want to be on top right now. %$* 143
they'd like to stay kind of in a strong position in the middle. %$* 143
you know, get their message out there to some extent, certainly talking to voters more. %$* 143
but it's very hard to maintain your position at the top of the poll. %$* 143
they're drafting right now, right. %$* 53
right. %$* 143
just getting -- %$* 53
and you see rand paul try to break through some of this like he got the chain saw and was taking it to the tax -- you've seen them try to get some ink here. %$* 173
but it's hard. %$* 173
because donald trump is so -- such a master of the media that all the oxygen has been taken up by him. %$* 173
it's interesting if you look at our poll -- this is just republican voters. %$* 53
republican voters, republican leaning independents -- who do you think is going to win the nomination? %$* 53
now people who vote -- this will change. %$* 53
who do you think is going to win today? %$* 53
31 percent think jeb bush is going to win; 22 percent though think donald trump is going to win; 14 percent scott walker; then you see marco rubio and ted cruz. %$* 53
the jeb bush calculation is a little different. %$* 53
what they say is go back to whether it's somebody running against bob dole or somebody running against john mccain or against mitt romney that there's always some chaos and the establishment guy wins. %$* 53
so their hope is to just stay there and deal with the chaos. %$* 53
but we'll see how it plays out. %$* 53
it's fascinating. %$* 53
again more poll numbers coming up at the top of the hour on "state of the union". %$* 53
next for us here, a new sign of hillary clinton's weakness? %$* 53
highlighting the path republicans think gets them back to the white house. %$* 53
first though politicians say the darnedest things. %$* 53
listen to president obama in kenya making light of those who argue he's not eligible to be our president. %$* 53
i suspect that some of my critics back home are suggesting that i'm back here to look for my birth certificate. %$* 40
that is not the case. %$* 40
welcome back. %$* 53
both parties, of course, locked in their presidential primary battles right now. %$* 53
but we did get a good reminder this past week about the terrain, at least potential terrain, for the 2016 general election. %$* 53
colorado, iowa and virginia -- 56 percent unfavorable in colorado; 56 percent unfavorable about hillary clinton in iowa; 50 percent unfavorable in virginia. %$* 798
again, three key swing states in presidential politics. %$* 798
in fact at the moment hillary clinton loses all three of those states to jeb bush, to marco rubio, and to scott walker. %$* 798
so if you're a republican and you're looking at the map in 2016, this is obama versus romney. %$* 798
that's a tough map to look at for republican. %$* 798
but play out what we just saw. %$* 798
what if republicans win colorado, win %$* 798
iowa, and win virginia? %$* 798
now, under this scenario hillary clinton would next -- still be the next president of the united states. %$* 798
but how do republicans if they can do that get to the white house? %$* 798
here's what they think. %$* 798
win the two big ones. %$* 798
you take florida, you take ohio, that's a republican presidential. %$* 798
and the democrats narrowly lose. %$* 798
that's a long way off but remember it's a tough map for republicans but they can do it with just five states, actually. %$* 798
just change five states and you can do it. %$* 798
lisa lerer at the core of the questions in colorado, virginia and iowa about hillary clinton -- her honesty and trustworthiness. %$* 798
with that as the back drop it cannot be a good thing to have the justice department now getting a referral to investigate whether sensitive classified information was somehow mishandled through her private e-mail server. %$* 798
right. %$* 184
this e-mail thing, there's little question that this e-mail thing is a problem for hillary clinton. %$* 184
now, you know, folks in the clinton campaign, the clinton camp say look we know there's a section of the country that will never vote for hillary clinton. %$* 184
this e-mail situation reaffirms what they already think. %$* 184
but the danger here is that it sets an early narrative about her campaign. %$* 184
we saw that with mitt romney, right. %$* 184
democrats were really effective, painting him as this heartless plutocrat. %$* 184
so if republicans are able to use these e-mails to make hillary look like this washington creature who will do anything to win, that's bad for her. %$* 184
we're seeing a drop in her numbers and it might well be attributed to those e-mails. %$* 184
and there's also because of the court case there's a monthly disclosure of these e-mails that's mandated by the court. %$* 184
so that means every month there's going to be another spate of stories. %$* 184
that's bad for her. %$* 184
bad for her. %$* 53
she addressed this yesterday in iowa. %$* 53
she would prefer to be talking about the economy, she would prefer to be talking the issues she thinks helps her first against the democratic rivals and then looking ahead to november. %$* 53
instead she had to say i'm confident i'll be fine. %$* 53
i am confident that i never sent nor received any information that was classified at the time it was sent and received. %$* 149
if we were not asking for it to be made public, there would not be a debate. %$* 149
this is all about my desire to have transparency and make the information public. %$* 149
that last part makes you roll your eyes a little bit. %$* 53
she was not exactly at the forefront of transparency in trying to make this public. %$* 53
and in fact if she had listened to the president of the united states, her boss on day one of the administration and done this on a government server we wouldn't have these issues. %$* 53
we wouldn't be asking these questions. %$* 53
but how potentially damaging is this just to have an investigation leaves you with lawyers and worry? %$* 53
and you know, every candidate at some point deals with some kind of investigation, you know, whether it's bogus or not. %$* 143
the problem for the clintons is that this has baked into to their image over so many years. %$* 143
you think of that clip right there, she sounds so lawyerly and, you know, you have to parse every word and people don't like that. %$* 143
it just gets a trust thing that's very hard for the clintons to overcome. %$* 143
because people do know all of that history, and revives all of that every time we have this conversation. %$* 143
yes, and they keep saying listen, the "times" is essentially out to get us. %$* 173
that's how they framed it, and the "times" did have to do some walk-backs on this story. %$* 173
it will be up to the public editor to sort all of that stuff out. %$* 173
they also say listen, it's still early, you haven't had the kind of full campaign and sort of attack ads that you'll see going against walker, going against bush, whoever -- trump -- whoever the nominee is. %$* 173
they also say listen, bill clinton, his trust numbers were under water when he ran again in '96. %$* 173
so listen, i think they're also just thinking that voters kind of don't trust politicians any way and that's kind of baked into -- %$* 173
voters don't trust politicians. %$* 53
but to your point about the lawyerly answers -- that's one of the reasons donald trump is doing well. %$* 53
that's one of the reasons bernie sanders is doing well. %$* 53
they seem like they're not filtered. %$* 53
bernie was an important one to mention. %$* 178
whenever a clinton issue emerges it seems like we always frame it in the context of the general election. %$* 178
republicans will use this e-mail issue or benghazi as fodder. %$* 178
but it really could be critical for her in the primary. %$* 178
iowa, new hampshire -- sanders keeps drawing crowds. %$* 178
secretary clinton seems to be bogged down by these e-mail questions. %$* 178
there's not the momentum she hoped coming out of that roosevelt island speech to appeal to the left, start getting a groundswell of progressives. %$* 178
sanders still has that. %$* 178
when you talk to sanders' people they believe he's strong in iowa, he can win there. %$* 178
he can maybe go into his neighboring state new hampshire and win there. %$* 178
he doesn't have a national infrastructure like clinton but he could be competitive. %$* 178
there are some advantages to her to having competitive primary. %$* 184
i think in the clinton -- in the clinton world they expect him to do better sanders to do relatively well in iowa. %$* 184
he's from the neighboring state of vermont. %$* 184
he'll do well in new hampshire. %$* 184
they think this could be a primary. %$* 184
and that frankly is good for them. %$* 184
it's much better for her to have a primary than a coronation. %$* 184
what you're going to have to watch for in the first democratic debate whenever that gets scheduled for is whether they actually take the tough shots. %$* 184
sanders in iowa last weekend was really interesting, he was given the bait to go after her on taking contributions from goldman and he didn't. %$* 184
yes. %$* 173
he's like well, "i'm not a negative campaigner". %$* 173
he takes tough shots on the e-mails, on the speeches -- that changes the thing, right. %$* 184
you are exactly right although we could go back to our notebooks in 2007 and find that she doesn't want a coronation she wants a primary. %$* 53
right. %$* 184
let's listen to one of the things she said this week. %$* 53
when the black lives matter movement first started she didn't get it right the first time. %$* 53
she said some things that angered and we've had african- american activists saying it doesn't matter at all, well she's the leader, we're -- listen she tried to redo this week. %$* 53
i think we first have to acknowledge and believe that black lives matter. %$* 149
this is not just a slogan. %$* 149
this should be a guiding principle. %$* 149
important for her, to your point, and to everyone's point, that she's a, this is a part of the democratic base; b, this is a driving force in the -- among african-american activists right now; and c she's looking left to make sure she doesn't leave an opening. %$* 53
that's right. %$* 173
and she did say black lives matter i believe it was in december 2014. %$* 173
and then she kind of came back and said all lives matter after that. %$* 173
it's a very different from what we saw bill clinton do in 1992 with the sister souljah moment where he was saying i'm not going to be beholden to the african-american community there she is doing something very different and banking on those voters. %$* 173
but the country has changed. %$* 184
yes. %$* 173
and that's what she's banking on. %$* 173
you're talking about virginia, you're talking about colorado -- %$* 184
the party's changed as well. %$* 53
the question is whether she can keep that altogether on time here. %$* 53
next our reporters give you a sneak peek of what they're working on, including an effort to lure for another big name democrat -- a big name democrat into the presidential race. %$* 53
let's head around the inside politics table. %$* 53
ask our great reporters to share a nugget or two from their notebooks. %$* 53
maeve reston. %$* 53
they've been sending a lot of handouts  in nevada. %$* 143
and that state really is getting more and more fascinating by the moment. %$* 143
as we've seen rand paul's support collapse to some extent, with so many candidates in the race. %$* 143
it's looking like a it could turn into a real gut fight between jeb bush and rubio out there. %$* 143
obviously you've got as few as 40,000 voters who will be coming out to caucus. %$* 143
that's a little like a needle in a haystack. %$* 143
it's going to take intensive groundwork and both of them are really getting started on that front. %$* 143
we'll have to see. %$* 143
and of course the most important thing is that will be right before the florida primaries. %$* 143
so it could be their last duel. %$* 143
organizing a caucus environment makes it more fun. %$* 53
robert. %$* 53
in the 2000 campaign senator john mccain came out of nowhere in new hampshire to win the primary. %$* 53
his adviser at the time was john weaver. %$* 53
now john weaver is advising ohio governor john kasich. %$* 53
and when he looks at kasich's play in new hampshire kasich's in a strong position. %$* 53
he drew a huge crowds this week and almost few if any questions about donald trump. %$* 53
kasich's people talked to him late saturday. %$* 53
they believe he's drawing a different kind of crowd -- people who were looking for someone besides bush but more center right establishment within the party. %$* 53
they think slow and steady just like mccain in 2000 could win the race. %$* 53
all right. %$* 53
well, let's cover the case %$* 53
nia? %$* 53
riding with biden 2016. %$* 173
this, of course, is the draft joe biden movement. %$* 173
he has said that he'll decide by early august whether or not he's in this thing. %$* 173
in the meantime, they are organizing an early state. %$* 173
they released a video touting joe biden as the best successor to carry on obama's legacy and the person who really has backed the younger generation. %$* 173
they've got some ground, something of a ground game and people in the early states. %$* 173
i think the question is, if biden doesn't run, and folks think it's pretty unlikely that he actually gets in this thing, where does this support go? %$* 173
hard to believe it's almost early august. %$* 799
july is gone -- %$* 799
lisa. %$* 799
so to flip-flop is human at least if you're a politician. %$* 184
but donald trump may be one of the biggest wafflers we've seen in a while. %$* 184
take what he said about president obama in 2009, he bestowed one of his highest compliments saying he would hire him. %$* 184
two years later he's asking for his birth certificate. %$* 184
in 2004 he said he was a democrat, now he's running on the republican ticket. %$* 184
and of course, there's the hundreds of thousands he's given to hillary clinton and her family foundation. %$* 184
now she's the worst secretary of state in the history of the world. %$* 184
so, you can bet that a lot of republican candidates are studying up on these reversals. %$* 184
the only question, what we're all going to be watching for, is when they use them and if that happens in two weeks, in the next debate. %$* 184
first debate. %$* 53
we look forward to see who pulls that one out of the quiver. %$* 53
i'll close with this. %$* 53
it's no secret ted cruz and mitch mcconnell don't like each other and don't trust each other. %$* 53
but the tea party senator and presidential candidate from texas dramatically escalated their feud this past week by going to the senate floor and publicly and repeatedly calling the majority leader a liar. %$* 53
it was a stunning speech in a chamber where the rules prohibit questioning the character of another senator. %$* 53
at issue was mcconnell's decision to allow a vote to restore funding for the export/import bank. %$* 53
the establishment chamber of commerce says that funding is critical to create jobs and keep jobs here in america. %$* 53
tea party groups including those funded by the deep-pocketed koch brothers they call it wasteful corporate welfare. %$* 53
why was cruz's language so harsh? %$* 53
he says it's all about senate business and what he insists is a broken mcconnell promise. %$* 53
but others say look at the calendar. %$* 53
they say a koch brothers retreat this coming weekend may have been a factor as cruz looks to stand out among the presidential candidates who would very much like the koch brothers backing. %$* 53
that's it for inside politics. %$* 53
again thanks for sharing your sunday morning. %$* 53
we'll see you soon. %$* 53
"state of the union" with jake tapper starts right now. %$* 53

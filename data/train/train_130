stained by the same air they breathe. %$* 1106
a dark shadow now hangs over their health, their future, because of yet another toxic legacy left behind by isis. %$* 1106
phil black, cnn, qayyara, northern iraq. %$* 1106
i know that is hard to watch. %$* 141
some images. %$* 29
yes. %$* 29
yes. %$* 141
it is something. %$* 141
we're going to see you back here at 10:00 eastern for cnn newsroom. %$* 141
"smerconish" starts right now. %$* 29
i'm michael smerconish coming to you from philadelphia where we welcome our viewers in the united states and around the world. %$* 1100
donald trump now making clear that his disruptive influence will extend far beyond america's borders. %$* 1100
the president-elect just broke with 40 years of american foreign policy by having a phone call with the leader of taiwan, which the u.s. doesn't officially recognize. %$* 1100
blunder or did he just expose a fiction? %$* 1100
christiane amanpour is here to analyze. %$* 1100
plus, will trump-slash-brexit style anti-globalism sweep europe? %$* 1100
two closely watched elections tomorrow in austria and italy will tell us a lot. %$* 1100
i'll speak to the first foreign politician to meet the president- elect, the brit behind brexit, nigel farage. %$* 1100
plus, ronald reagan won two presidential terms by huge landslides. %$* 1100
so why does jeff greenfield say trump is poised to have a bigger impact on american politics despite losing the popular vote? %$* 1100
also, right here in philly, an anti-trump graffiti incident turns out to have an unusual participant, an ascot-wearing city employee, an attorney. %$* 1100
should he be fired? %$* 1100
and espn's stephen a. smith said on this program that blacks were %$* 1100
being taken for granted by democrats and that was before donald trump said to african-americans, what do you have to lose? %$* 1100
stephen a. is also po'd that colin kaepernick didn't vote. %$* 1100
but first, it was just a phone call but it rang some alarm bells around the world yesterday. %$* 1100
the president-elect took a congratulatory call from taiwan president tsai ing-wen. %$* 1100
trump has vowed to redefine u.s. international relations, but does this kind of move endanger stability? %$* 1100
joining me now to discuss, christiane amanpour, cnn's chief international correspondent and of course the host of cnni's nightly interview, "amanpour." %$* 1100
former leader of the uk independent party, nigel farage, who helped spearhead the brexit revolt, and senator chris coons, a member of the foreign relations committee. %$* 1100
christiane, let me begin with you. %$* 1100
do you think that this was planned? %$* 1100
do you think that donald trump knew what he was doing, wanted to send a message to the chinese or was it a blunder? %$* 1100
well, the truth of the matter is i don't know whether it was planned. %$* 1107
i'm not sure that anybody outside the two principals know that. %$* 1107
but here's the real question, was it just a phone call? %$* 1107
and it certainly is an unusual precedent to set. %$* 1107
or does it signal something different? %$* 1107
and that would be a shift of u.s. relationship with the second most important country in the whole world which is china. %$* 1107
and i think what you have to look out for is the following, what will china do? %$* 1107
so far they've done what they have to do and that is lodge an official protest in a call to the white house and the white house has responded by saying, you know, business as usual, politics as usual, our bilateral relationship as usual. %$* 1107
and just to sum that up, the relationship is one in which china is the main china for the united states. %$* 1107
taiwan is not officially recognized by the united states, but as you know, the united states is committed to defending taiwan if ever it was to come under an invasion from china. %$* 1107
so that is the basic bottom line here. %$* 1107
so what will china do next, if anything? %$* 1107
what is donald trump's intention as president towards china and taiwan? %$* 1107
and does donald trump have business in taiwan that may or may not have been part of all of this? %$* 1107
those are the questions. %$* 1107
maybe donald trump is dumb like a fox? %$* 1100
maybe he is not well red in? %$* 1100
anderson cooper had an interesting exchange with kellyanne conway who managed his campaign. %$* 1100
listen to what she had to say on that issue last night. %$* 1100
president-elect trump is fully briefed and fully knowledgeable about these issues on an ongoing basis regardless of who is on the other end of the phone. %$* 4
he takes information that is given to him and provided to him. %$* 4
he veils himself of any number of different information sources and including those that come from the state department and including those that come from intelligence briefings. %$* 4
christiane, you have your fingers on the pulse all over the globe. %$* 1100
here is what i most want to ask you on this issue. %$* 1100
how do you think that this is being interpreted in capitals around the world? %$* 1100
well, look, you know, uncertainty is something that the foreign policy establishment doesn't really like. %$* 1107
uncertainty is something that can lead to, you know, a little bit of chaos, if i could put it in that sort of euphemism. %$* 1107
so people frankly around the world are simply not sure what to expect. %$* 1107
this is a completely unprecedented situation in the united states and no one is quite sure what to expect, beyond campaign rhetoric and beyond what we're seeing rolling out now in the initial days as president-elect. %$* 1107
so, yes, this phone call was a precedent buster. %$* 1107
it is the first time apparently that a u.s. president or president-elect has spoken officially to the president of taiwan and this is policy that dates back to nixon going to china in 1972 and then it was finalized by carter -- president carter in 1978, that china, beijing was the official relationship with the united states. %$* 1107
so, everyone around the world is watching to see what happens next. %$* 1107
and one other call that we haven't talked about is a call that was made between president-elect trump and president duterte of the philippines in which according to duterte's read-out and we haven't seen the trump read-out, according to duterte's read out, he says that donald trump spoke very kindly about some of the most controversial policies that duterte is carrying out. %$* 1107
and that is his anti-drug campaign which is basically leaving bodies stacked up in vigilante and extrajudicial killings all over the philippines. %$* 1107
and this has been roundly condemned by the united states, by the united nations, by human rights groups, by the asia pacific group, basically by everybody, and duterte has been very, very undiplomatically rude about the united states, threatening to break off with the united states, threatening to go into a whole new world order led by china and russia. %$* 1107
so all this to say that there are so-called strong men who are in power around the world now who have their own ideas about which way they want to see the world go. %$* 1107
and that may entail trying to up-end the alliances, the basic sort of foreign policy situations that we've been seeing over the last 40, 50 years and that is what and where the uncertainty lies right now. %$* 1107
thank you so much, christiane amanpour, for the big picture view on which we always come to you. %$* 1100
the surprise victory of donald trump seems less surprising if viewed as part of the global populist movement including last june's brexit vote for the uk to exit the european union. %$* 1100
joining me now, the first foreign politician to meet trump face to face after his election, uk independent party's nigel farage who helps spearhead the brexit revolt. %$* 1100
mr. farage, of course we're looking at election day tomorrow in two countries. %$* 1100
yes. %$* 1108
the question for you, what's the common denominator of this global movement? %$* 1100
you know, if you look at europe in particular, it's the feeling and the fact that people have lost the democratic right to control their own futures. %$* 1108
italy tomorrow is a eurozone member. %$* 1108
it finds itself unable to devalue competitively as it used to do one, you know, under the lira. %$* 1108
we've now seen 20 years of growth, 20 years with no growth at all in italy. %$* 1108
so whether it's the euro, whether it's mrs. merkel inviting unlimited numbers of migrants and then expecting other european states to share the numbers, this is about taking back control. %$* 1108
brexit was a vote for us to say, yes, we can be friendly with europe. %$* 1108
we can trade with europe, but we want to govern our own country, and i have to say that i think the momentum of this is now pretty much unstoppable. %$* 1108
is the special relationship that the united states enjoys with the uk in jeopardy as you well? %$* 1100
you paid a call, you were the first foreign leader to pay a call on president-elect trump. %$* 1100
he then sent out a tweet which i want to put up on the screen and remind everybody, he thought that you'd be a great pick to be the ambassador, the british ambassador to the united states. %$* 1100
theresa may, your prime minister, meanwhile, was apparently, call number 10? %$* 1100
what role can you play to positively influence the relationship between the united states and the united kingdom? %$* 1100
well, i do think the special relationship is very important. %$* 1108
it was significantly devalued during obama's time. %$* 1108
he looked to merkel. %$* 1108
he looked to the european union and you know, not to us as an independent country. %$* 1108
so post brexit we've got a chance to start all over again with a president in trump who is anglo file, he is pro british, you know, he knows the things that we've shared together over the years, the good and the bad, the tough times as well as the good. %$* 1108
and i think that i just happen to know a few people in his administration. %$* 1108
i've clearly got trump's confidence and i want us to move as quickly as we can towards a free trade deal between the uk and the usa. %$* 1108
that will be good for both of us and it will also send a signal to the european union that there's a bigger world outside of europe and that britain can manage just nicely. %$* 1108
no longer do we have a president who says -- %$* 1108
do you see -- %$* 1100
-- that we're at the back of the line. %$* 1108
do you see for yourself a formal role in the next four years? %$* 1100
you know, i honestly don't know the answer to that, but what i will say is i would like formally or informally to do whatever i can to bring our great nations a bit closer together. %$* 1108
how much of the worldwide movement that we're discussing is driven by the economy, the crash of '08 and the aftermath, and how much is being drawn by immigration and concerns over open borders? %$* 1100
well, in the north of europe it's being driven by immigration. %$* 1108
and in the south of europe it's being driven by people being stuck inside a currency which as i said earlier they cannot devalue and they've got no control over interest rates that increasingly they can't even set their own tax rate. %$* 1108
so it's both. %$* 1108
but the common denominator is that people have lost the democratic rights of self government. %$* 1108
they're not able to make their own decisions that affect their futures. %$* 1108
i mean, i promise you this european union is dying before your eyes. %$* 1108
i can't tell you how long it will take but basically it's finished. %$* 1108
how do you maintain the proper balance of protecting one's sovereignty while at the same time being exposed to all the positive influences of globalization? %$* 1100
well, if we very quickly move to a u.s./uk free trade deal, that shows that wanting nation state independence and democracy isn't turning your backs on the world, it's just being able to make your own decisions. %$* 1108
and i think that, you know, had hillary won this election, you know, she wanted the european union to be a prototype for a bigger model across the whole little world. %$* 1108
that is now gone. %$* 1108
because you want to govern your own country, does not make your insular, does not make your small minded. %$* 1108
nigel farage, thank you so much for being here. %$* 1100
thank you. %$* 1108
joining me now from the great state of delaware, united states senator chris coons, whose committee assignments include foreign relations. %$* 1100
senator, let me go back and talk about taiwan. %$* 1100
of what significance do you think the telephone call that is leading the news today? %$* 1100
well, michael, we'll have to see whether this is the beginning of a new chapter where the president- elect after he is inaugurated conducts a foreign policy that is shoot from the hip, twitter storm style where he gets into twitter fights or takes unscheduled calls from foreign leaders in ways that break with decades of precedent like this congratulatory call from the president of taiwan or whether he relies on the advice of career professors in the state department and makes moves in a sort of calculated and thoughtful way. %$* 1109
what we know from the campaign, michael, is that president-elect trump promised that he would shake things up and he made a number of concerning or even alarming proposals during the campaign about reconsidering our commitment to nato, rethinking our commitment to provide nuclear umbrella to south korea and japan and that set the foreign policy elites to twitter. %$* 1109
i do think the folks who voted for trump aren't concerned by whether he takes a call from this leader or that leader, but i do think this particular call, because it breaks with nearly four decades of precedent, and certainly will concern, even alarm one of the most powerful and important countries in the world with whom he will have to deal closely is concerning because it may show the direction he's going to go as president. %$* 1109
this may make for great reality tv, but it doesn't make for great leadership in a divided world where there's a lot of conflicts that we have to manage carefully. %$* 1109
you made reference to his twitter account. %$* 1100
let me put on the screen something that he tweeted and i want to ask senator coons in this instance, doesn't he have a point? %$* 1100
well, actually that's the first of two tweets. %$* 1100
first he said the president of taiwan called me. %$* 1100
i didn't call her. %$* 1100
but go to the second tweet and let me show senator coons what he said, "interesting how the u.s. sells taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but i should not accept a congratulatory call." %$* 1100
isn't he that in saying that? %$* 1100
well, what he is ignoring is that there is this carefully balanced situation with the chinese where we publicly accept the one china policy. %$* 1109
we do not have conversations or meetings between the president of the united states and the elected president of taiwan, yet we still under our law provide them with defense equipment, with military aid. %$* 1109
that is a very delicate balance. %$* 1109
and so while it seems to make common sense to the average person that, you know, he can just take a congratulatory call, this is the case with diplomacy and with world relations. %$* 1109
there are many different situations in the world where over decades we've settled into a sort of carefully calibrated situation. %$* 1109
and this is one where, you know, the civil war of china decades ago led to two countries, taiwan and china, and from 1979, the united states has recognized the people's republic of china and our policy has been to say it is one china. %$* 1109
so he has set that a little bit on its ear and we'll have to see what the consequences are in u.s.-china relations. %$* 1109
senator coons, thank you as always. %$* 1100
we really always appreciate your perspective. %$* 1100
thanks, michael. %$* 1109
what do you think? %$* 1100
tweet me @smerconish. %$* 1100
i'll read some during the course of the program. %$* 1100
as a matter of fact, here we go. %$* 1100
"smerconish, you are dealing with the ignorance of a privileged frat boy on diplomatic matters." %$* 1100
what, i'm the one who took the call from the taiwanese president? %$* 1100
i mean, come on. %$* 1100
give me a break. %$* 1100
put up another one. %$* 1100
i love the tweets. %$* 1100
"no one really gets to tell the president who he gets to talk to. %$* 1100
u.s. defends taiwan." %$* 1100
ok. %$* 1100
there is some hypocrisy among the criticism. %$* 1100
as i was just pointing out with senator coons, i mean, we do trade billions of dollars of weaponry and military intelligence, and yet we then say you can't take that telephone call. %$* 1100
still to come, what a story, a lawyer for the city of captured on surveillance video toting wine and watching another man spray "f trump" on the side of an upscale grocery store. %$* 1100
should he lose his job? %$* 1100
and espn's stephen a. smith on the role of the black vote in trump's election and his anger over nfl star colin kaepernick's choice not to vote at all. %$* 1100
since election day, pro and anti-trump graffiti has been reported throughout the nation and right here in my hometown of philadelphia. %$* 1100
spray painted swastika's racist graffiti, everywhere from bus shelters to the exterior of city hall where somebody sprayed "not my president." %$* 1100
and then the day after thanksgiving, an anti-trump graffiti incident turns out to have an unusual participant, city employee, an attorney no less. %$* 1100
here's surveillance footage of the crime at a newly opened fresh grocer on german town avenue. %$* 1100
you'll see the man doing the graffiti and then the other guy, presumably taking pictures, clad in a navy blue blazer and ascot which already has earned him the attention of "town and country" magazine, holding a glass of wine, looking on. %$* 1100
that's 32-year-old duncan lloyd, an assistant city solicitor who has worked for the city's law department since 2011. %$* 1100
the cost of removing the vandalism is estimated to be between $3,000 and $10,000, but that isn't the only issue here. %$* 1100
as of now, lloyd has not been charged with any crime and still has his job. %$* 1100
would that be the case if he graffitied anything else, like maybe "f hillary"? %$* 1100
joining me now, veteran criminal defense attorney william brennan who's representing duncan lloyd and joe defelice, the chair of the philadelphia republican party. %$* 1100
counselor brennan, i know you. %$* 1100
you're good at what you do, but how are you going to defend this? %$* 1100
i don't think and i hope i never have to defend this, michael. %$* 1110
i hate to lawyer up immediately, but you described my client as a participant and you said that if he graffitied anything, the only thing my client had in his hand in that video is a glass of red wine, and in our commonwealth, to be merely present when a crime occurs does not impute culpability. %$* 1110
and the video clearly shows --  smerconish:  well, it's hard -- it's hard for me to tell from the %$* 1110
video. %$* 1110
it's hard for me to tell from the video, but it seems as if he may be filming with a cell phone. %$* 1110
doesn't that make him an accessory? %$* 1110
isn't there a conspiracy going on here? %$* 1110
absolutely not. %$* 1110
it would be analogous to two guys leaving a bar and walking to their car and one guy deciding to urinate publicly against the wall of a home or business. %$* 1110
the other guy has no prior knowledge of that and in this case, the video simply shows my client with a glass of wine in his hand, his other hand is primarily in his pocket and then there appears to be a scenario where he may or may not take either a still shot or a video, but you can't impute his intention for taking that if it was posted somewhere -- if, in fact, the video or a cell phone photo exists and he posted it on social media, different story. %$* 1110
but that video clearly, clearly exculpates duncan lloyd. %$* 1110
he keeps his distance. %$* 1110
hey, joe -- %$* 1100
he doesn't participate and he is not guilty of anything. %$* 1110
hey, joe -- let's talk the politics here. %$* 1100
all right. %$* 1100
a little less law and a little more politics for you, joe defelice. %$* 1100
i think counselor brennan figures he's going to be just fine and his client will be fine because trump got trounced in the city of philadelphia. %$* 1100
what's the registration, like 7-1 against you these days? %$* 1100
if the spray paint had said "f hillary"-- %$* 1100
yes, unfortunately. %$* 1111
if the spray paint had said "f hillary," whoever did it would probably be in solitary confinement right now, don't you think? %$* 1100
we're not even having this discussion right now, michael, if that was the case. %$* 1111
mayor kenny is left of left. %$* 1111
he supports every liberal cause. %$* 1111
and in this situation we wouldn't be having this discussion. %$* 1111
he would have been out tweeting day one. %$* 1111
now he's taken a wait and see attitude. %$* 1111
so, i mean, this is your new democratic party, right? %$* 1111
the wine glass, the ascot, the blazer. %$* 1111
it's a coastal party. %$* 1111
you know, they just re-elected nancy pelosi, it's chestnut hill. %$* 1111
it's pine street to pine street in the city of philadelphia. %$* 1111
they lost their blue-collar base. %$* 1111
and this is what they do. %$* 1111
they block traffic when people are trying to get home from work. %$* 1111
it's the snowflakes, it's the millennial crowd that doesn't want, you know, people to get home from work. %$* 1111
and it's not my president. %$* 1111
and i can graffiti because nothing is going to happen to me. %$* 1111
look, that's the new democratic party. %$* 1111
and if you don't buy into well, then come over to us because we could sure use your help here in the city. %$* 1111
hey, brennan, you're not going to let him wear that ascot in court, are you? %$* 1100
brennan:  michael, i just heard the police go on some roll about pine %$* 1100
street to pine street. %$* 1100
i care about one guy, duncan lloyd. %$* 1100
he did absolutely nothing wrong here. %$* 1100
and i -- it is my hope -- he's been totally cooperative, but when i hear, joe -- well, joe and i are northeast philly guys. %$* 1100
we come from almost the same neighborhood. %$* 1100
when i was a kid, we all wore army jackets, we called them parkwood tuxedos. %$* 1100
apparently in chestnut hill you wear ascots. %$* 1100
and i -- mike, i know -- you may wear an ascot, michael, i don't know. %$* 1100
but i know that without the wine glass and the ascot -- %$* 1100
only on weekends. %$* 1100
it's not sensationalized. %$* 1110
but, bill -- bill listen. %$* 1100
but i have to focus on duncan lloyd. %$* 1110
he did nothing wrong. %$* 1110
i'm laughing -- all right. %$* 1100
listen, i'm laughing along with some of this, but vandalism was committed here. %$* 1100
shouldn't he -- even if i buy into him not breaking the law, and i'm not sure about that, but shouldn't he be held to a higher standard? %$* 1100
i am. %$* 1110
he's an officer of the court. %$* 1100
he's a city lawyer. %$* 1100
michael, what should he do? %$* 1110
should have tackled the guy and thereby committed assault? %$* 1110
and no one knows what he's done in the intervening days. %$* 1110
i can -- i'm not going to comment specifically on an ongoing investigation. %$* 1110
he's been totally cooperative. %$* 1110
and mike, if he's guilty of anything, which he's not, he had one too many glasses of wine on thanksgiving. %$* 1110
if that's a crime, i'd be doing life. %$* 1110
this gentleman did not participate in any criminal activity. %$* 1110
and i agree -- i disagree. %$* 1110
i mean, to say with joe, and frankly with you, michael, about whether it says blank trump or blank hillary. %$* 1110
if it said go phillies, it doesn't matter to me. %$* 1110
my guy had a glass of wine in his hand, not a can of krylon. %$* 1110
joe defelice, you get the final word. %$* 1100
do you think the message that was spray painted, the "f trump," is what has thus far governed the way this case has been handled, if there is a case? %$* 1100
well, it doesn't say go phillies. %$* 1111
it says "f trump." %$* 1111
and let's be honest, this wasn't a random building. %$* 1111
this building is owned by a republican donor. %$* 1111
this was clearly a message sent to that republican donor. %$* 1111
i don't agree with that. %$* 1110
we don't want you in our neighborhood. %$* 1111
go ahead, joe. %$* 1100
i missed your second point. %$* 1100
defelice:  yes. %$* 1100
no. %$* 1100
essentially, look, of course it's -- you know, %$* 1100
if it would have said go phillies or go eagles or go flyers. %$* 1100
it doesn't say that. %$* 1100
it deals with donald trump. %$* 1100
it's dealing specifically with this election in the city of philadelphia, of all places, ground zero for this past election. %$* 1100
it doesn't -- if it said go hillary, it doesn't -- we wouldn't be having -- "f hillary," we're not having this. %$* 1100
he's fired a week ago. %$* 1100
hey, joe -- %$* 1110
it doesn't say that. %$* 1111
is it any less graffiti if it says go phillies? %$* 1110
it's graffiti that we're talking about. %$* 1110
no, it's -- yes, because -- %$* 1111
graffiti. %$* 1110
it's graffiti that's targeted. %$* 1111
i mean, this was clearly targeted. %$* 1111
you know, richard snowden owns that building. %$* 1111
richard snowden -- %$* 1111
not by duncan lloyd. %$* 1110
he gave -- %$* 1111
gentlemen, i'm out of time. %$* 1100
four years ago in chestnut hill. %$* 1111
i wish we had more time. %$* 1100
brennan, i'd like to see you in a green ascot next time. %$* 1100
thank you, joe defelice. %$* 1100
appreciate you as well. %$* 1100
next time, michael. %$* 1110
thanks, michael. %$* 1111
i think he's out. %$* 1110
here is another of your tweets. %$* 1100
let's see what's rolling in. %$* 1100
"smerconish, this lloyd situation has taken me back to a bad law school exam question, but there's no evidence of support, no liability." %$* 1100
nader, you might be right except if they knew what they were doing in advance and if they were partners in this caper, and if they agreed that this guy was going to film it, and they were going to swap it among other folks. %$* 1100
i don't know the second half of that. %$* 1100
but it's an intriguing question. %$* 1100
you're right. %$* 1100
coming up when nfl star quarterback colin kaepernick refused to stand during the national anthem to protest racial injustice, he set off a national firestorm, but espn's stephen a. smith defended him. %$* 1100
then kaepernick didn't vote on election day and smith, he went ballistic. %$* 1100
he is here to discuss. %$* 1100
i would personally make a request to the media in this nation. %$* 121
do me a favor and make sure one thing. %$* 121
take the camera away from him. %$* 121
it means nothing. %$* 121
because for him not to vote, as far as i'm concerned, everything he said meant absolutely nothing. %$* 121
espn and sirius xm commentator stephen a. smith likes to stir things up. %$* 1100
he was in the news recently for calling 49ers quarterback colin kaepernick a flaming hypocrite for not bothering to vote in the election. %$* 1100
the last time he appeared on this program, he said that african-americans should consider voting republican because democrats take them for granted. %$* 1100
i definitely believe that the black vote has been taken for granted. %$* 121
i'm simply saying, let's not be so transparent in our support for one party over another when that does not appear to be working for us. %$* 121
force people to flatter us. %$* 121
white folks do it. %$* 121
jewish folks do it. %$* 121
hispanic folks are doing it. %$* 121
why can't black folks do it? %$* 121
that's all i'm saying. %$* 121
i want to ask you -- %$* 1100
and of course donald trump took a page out of stephen a. %$* 1100
's playbook when he famously said this about black voters. %$* 1100
look how much african-american communities have suffered under democratic control. %$* 5
you're living in poverty. %$* 5
your schools are no good. %$* 5
you have no jobs. %$* 5
58 percent of your youth is unemployed. %$* 5
what the hell do you have to lose? %$* 5
hey, stephen a., it's great to have you back. %$* 1100
when he made those statements, what were you thinking? %$* 1100
were you thinking, yes, that's exactly what i was talking about? %$* 1100
well, it was hard to decipher -- you know, to separate the two things, michael, from the standpoint that i certainly did not like nor did i approve of the rhetoric that he was spewing throughout the election, even though that was completely contradictory to everything that i had seen from donald trump in my years of covering him as a sports journalist, remember, he is a former owner for -- the generals for the usfl, he wanted to own the buffalo bills. %$* 121
so i communicated with him in the past in regards to sports matters, and i certainly never heard the rhetoric that he was spewing during the election. %$* 121
he did have points, but at the same time, to sit up there and your argument to be what the hell do you have to lose? %$* 121
i'm not sure that was the strongest argument to make and even though i certainly understand how you took my sound bite and then you pointed to what he said, forgive me if i'm not overly flattered by the fact that donald trump somewhat echoed anything that i had to say during the election because i didn't like a lot of what he said. %$* 121
he did run better with african-americans than did mitt romney four years ago, arguably, though, you know, he wasn't facing an african-american himself. %$* 1100
that is true. %$* 121
how do you assess the way in which trump ended up fairing among people of color? %$* 1100
well, i don't think it was about him. %$* 121
i thought he was lucky to get the 8 percent that he got. %$* 121
i thought that it was very, very telling that even though hillary clinton got 88 percent of the african-american vote, it was 5 percent less than what barack obama had ultimately captured. %$* 121
and you know, you can point to the fact that he was an african-american and obviously the black community was going to come out and support him. %$* 121
certainly i'm not going to apologize for it and nor should any black person. %$* 121
but in the same breath, let's also take into account why she didn't receive the support she should have received with two million less black votes came out to support her than did obama. %$* 121
you had a 74- year-old renowned socialist in bernie sanders going up against her and he had more of the young vote, he had more black people looking forward to the things that he had to say being exercised. %$* 121
you also have hillary clinton's history in terms of that crime bill. %$* 121
yes, it was her husband who pushed forth the crime bill that led to mass incarceration on the part of african-americans in this country. %$* 121
we know that. %$* 121
but she wasn't just the typical first lady. %$* 121
she was somebody that went out there and lobbied on his behalf, the word superpredator is something that is etched in all of our minds. %$* 121
yes. %$* 1100
that definitely played a role. %$* 121
and then of course you know the e-mail scandal and what have you. %$* 121
you hate to throw something like that out, but the reality of the situation is clear, the compilation of all of those things didn't lend itself towards being, you know, supportive of her with a degree of fervor. %$* 121
i appreciated what you said about colin kaepernick, as %$* 684
someone who is 54, registered to vote when i turned 18, i've never in my life missed voting in an election. %$* 684
neither have i. %$* 121
expand on what you had to say about him. %$* 1100
well, listen, the fact is he had every right to protest and when he was talking about racial injustices and things of that nature, you certainly can understand where he was coming from. %$* 121
it was a quiet protest. %$* 121
he didn't impede anybody's ability to watch the game, to come to the games or anything like that which is why i went on "good morning america," my show "first take" on espn 2 every weekday from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon, and other outlets to support him. %$* 121
however, the second that he decided that he was not going to vote and then to publicly reveal that he wasn't voting, i thought it was egregious to the highest order. %$* 121
i thought it compromised everything that he was standing for and more importantly i thought it was a disrespect to our ancestors, to people who have bled and fought and died for him to have the right to do that and then also take into account the fact that we have a president who is outgoing in barack obama who captured 93 percent of the black vote, who obviously black folks come out and support. %$* 121
he went before the congressional black caucus and went campaigning on behalf of hillary clinton, basically imploring our community to activate itself in this election if you had any respect whatsoever for his legacy. %$* 121
now colin kaepernick turns around and you decide not to vote, as far as i'm concerned, you just obliterated every argument that you were trying to make. %$* 121
and i'm not saying that his arguments have no credence whatsoever. %$* 121
i'm saying that he himself compromised his own message and because of that i don't want to listen to him anymore because the number one tool that we have in america to provoke change is our power to vote. %$* 121
it's something that we fought for. %$* 121
it's something that was exacted to us in 1964-1965. %$* 121
how in god's name could you sit up there and justify not voting? %$* 121
there's no excuse for it whatsoever. %$* 121
i understand there's a lack of understanding. %$* 121
there's youth that we're talking about here. %$* 121
the player's association, it would be nice to see them get themselves involved, speaking up on his behalf in some accord, but the bottom line is that it was a dereliction of duty on his part and it was flagrantly so, and i'm not letting him get a pass on that. %$* 121
i'm just not. %$* 121
final quick subject off the chart a little bit because it's not sports and it's not politics per se. %$* 1100
but it's an act of vandalism. %$* 1100
i still think of stephen a. as a philly guy. %$* 1100
what do you do with a city-employed lawyer who was not doing the spray painting but was in the company of a guy who spray paints a building "f trump"? %$* 1100
i think you definitely suspend him. %$* 121
there has to be some repercussions for such an irresponsible act. %$* 121
would i contemplate firing him? %$* 121
yes. %$* 121
i'm not sure that i would. %$* 121
i want to hear what his explanation would be in the matter. %$* 121
but perceptions sometimes usurp reality. %$* 121
and he definitely has to be made to be held accountable for that. %$* 121
anybody, any juvenile can go out there and vandalize or record somebody vandalizing, giving the ok for it. %$* 121
but it doesn't make it right. %$* 121
and when you're educated and when you're supposed to have some degree of not only intellect but a core decency that the government relies upon you to exercise, because again you said he was a government employee, to sit up there and record such actions are inexcusable and you need to be called out on it and punished for it. %$* 121
you certainly have the right to do what you want. %$* 121
and everybody wants to articulate their position in the united states of america. %$* 121
but you also have the right to suffer repercussions for your actions. %$* 121
we all know that. %$* 121
we accept it. %$* 121
those are big boy and big girl rules. %$* 121
we have to accept that. %$* 121
this man is a lawyer. %$* 121
he certainly knew better and he should be made to answer for it. %$* 121
there's no question about that. %$* 121
stephen a., next time you will tell us if there's an ascot in your closet. %$* 1100
thank you for being here. %$* 1100
appreciate it. %$* 1100
there isn't one. %$* 121
don't even worry about that. %$* 121
i leave that to my man rowland martin. %$* 121
you're telling me already. %$* 1100
that's not me. %$* 1100
see you, stephen. %$* 1100
thank you. %$* 1100
another of your tweets, what do we got here? %$* 1100
"smerconish, oh, please a man walks by and you want charges? %$* 1100
you are the snow flake in this," he wasn't just walking by, i don't think. %$* 1100
i think the whole thing was seemingly planned. %$* 1100
we're going to find out, though. %$* 1100
one more tweet if we've got time for it. %$* 1100
no more tweets? %$* 1100
there we go. %$* 1100
"smerconish, the guy looked around as the lookout for the spray painter. %$* 1100
he is guilty." %$* 1100
right, haily. %$* 1100
i mean, it looks like -- you know, there was nobody else in the camera image. %$* 1100
did you notice that? %$* 1100
it's midnight. %$* 1100
i should have explained. %$* 1100
they're the only two there. %$* 1100
coincidence, i think not. %$* 1100
ronald reagan, he won in two landslides. %$* 1100
donald trump lost the popular vote and a difference of 80,000 votes across just three states could have swung the electoral college to hillary clinton, but according to veteran journalist jeff greenfield, it's trump whose presidency could have a bigger, longer lasting impact on america. %$* 1100
why does he say that? %$* 1100
i'll ask him next. %$* 1100
so donald trump lost the popular vote by two million votes, and if he lost just 80,000 more votes across three swing states, he'd also have lost the electoral college. %$* 1100
whereas ronald reagan won his two terms in landslides, 44 states, 489 electoral votes in 1980 and then four years later 49 states and 525 electoral votes. %$* 1100
clear mandate, right? %$* 1100
and yet in this piece for politico, veteran journalist jeff greenfield says, "the long-term effect of the reagan presidency and the way it had such an impact on american politics was actually negligible." %$* 1100
while trump may well preside over, quote, "the most significant changes in public policy since the new deal." %$* 1100
here to explain is jeff greenfield. %$* 1100
so, jeff, you say that ronald reagan was elected with a mandate, twice as a matter of fact, and yet changed so little. %$* 1100
donald trump lost the popular vote and is about to change so much. %$* 1100
explain. %$* 1100
well, when reagan came in with 489 electoral vote, 10-point in the popular vote majority with a newly republican senate that would seem to qualify as a mandate under any circumstances. %$* 1112
but he leaves eight years later, the size of the federal government is no smaller, the federal debt and deficit is bigger, no departments had been eliminated. %$* 1112
two of his supreme court nominees underwrite the core of "roe v. wade," wanting and writes the gay marriage decision. %$* 1112
and the reasons why trump has so much more potential to change everything lies in a couple of things. %$* 1112
one is, reagan never had both houses of congress. %$* 1112
the house was always democratic. %$* 1112
and it's also important -- and i think this is key, the republican party was very different. %$* 1112
when reagan came in, the senate was filled with moderate and even liberal republicans. %$* 1112
packwood of oregon, hatfield of oregon, mathias of maryland, specter and hines in pennsylvania. %$* 1112
so between a democratic house and a very different republican party, he had to negotiate all kinds of compromises whether it was on taxes, on social spending, on how you reform social security. %$* 1112
conservatives don't like to acknowledge this, but you know, one of the things that reagan did was at one point brought the capital gains tax up to the same level as ordinary income. %$* 1112
trump has a wholly different terrain, not just both houses of congress but a republican party so much more homogenous, so much more solidly conservative, and so much committed to really fundamental changes in everything from tax structure to social policy that i think the potential is there for trump to oversee the kind of change we haven't seen in decades and decades. %$* 1112
to your point, there were so many republican moderates in the senate that they had their own gathering, they called it the wednesday lunch club. %$* 1100
all right, so in what areas do you think he's about to be a president of lasting consequence? %$* 1100
the most obvious is the supreme court. %$* 1112
david souter, george h.w. %$* 1112
bush's first pick, is i think will go down as the last apostate nominee. %$* 1112
that is, a nominee put forward by the president of one party who then disappoints his followers. %$* 1112
we haven't seen that since, not in clinton's, not in george w. bush's, not in obama's. %$* 1112
i think the fact that trump essentially outsourced the supreme court picks to the federalist society and the fact that the conservatives on his list are much more inclined to be judicial activists. %$* 1112
they don't like to say that, that is to reach into constitutional law to make some fundamental changes on areas involving privacy, perhaps even on areas involving the government's economic regulation that if he has more than one pick and the actuarially the odds are he'll have two or three, that's going to be changes for a generation. %$* 1112
i think you're also going to see rapidly in congress, an undoing of many of obama's signature policies, the affordable healthcare being one of them, though how much they can do and how quickly, we don't know. %$* 1112
and i think you're going to see big rollbacks in obama's approach to environmental regulations, an approach that was, to some extent, endorsed by republican presidents. %$* 1112
we're not just talking about trump undoing obama. %$* 1112
you know, you think about the epa, that was put into power by richard nixon. %$* 1112
so this is what i mean by the potential reach of trump, given how much the republican party has moved right. %$* 1112
and to the extent that they now control all the branches of government. %$* 1112
that's why i think the potential is there for huge change. %$* 1112
whether you like it or are appalled by it. %$* 1112
half the country is smiling, adhering, jeff greenfield, the other half is bristling. %$* 1100
thank you so much for your analysis. %$* 1100
a pleasure as always, michael. %$* 1112
keep tweeting me @smerconish where they're really rolling in. %$* 1100
let's see. %$* 1100
"if kaepernick didn't vote, then his protests against racial injustice mean nothing. %$* 1100
he didn't do everything he could." %$* 1100
i mean, that was pretty much steven a's point. %$* 1100
and i am in that category. %$* 1100
i'm one who says you've got to go vote if you really want to have your voice heard. %$* 1100
keep the tweets coming. %$* 1100
here's what you thought @smerconish. %$* 1100
"kaepernick? %$* 1100
although he didn't vote which is absolutely wrong, but smerconish didn't vote for any candidate, too." %$* 1100
you know, hyman, that's bs. %$* 1100
of course i voted in the presidential election. %$* 1100
this is the last i'm going to say it. %$* 1100
i didn't vote for him and i didn't vote for her. %$* 1100
but there were more candidates running. %$* 1100
and write-in opportunities. %$* 1100
think about it. %$* 1100
show me another one. %$* 1100
"give me a break, lawyer not guilty." %$* 1100
that's the spray painting incident. %$* 1100
ok, another. %$* 1100
"stephen a has more ascots that smerconish." %$* 1100
yes, i think he does. %$* 1100
don't you think? %$* 1100
ascot gate. %$* 1100
stephen a. smith. %$* 1100
thanks for watching, we'll see you next week. %$* 1100

unflagging support on the fourth of july. %$* 116
president bush pays holiday tribute to democracy and u.s. troops in iraq. %$* 116
as iraqis stand up, we will stand down. %$* 161
and then our troops can come home to a proud and grateful nation. %$* 161
the fireworks begin, even before the president names a high court nominee. %$* 116
we'll showcase the sparks on the left and the right and the public's view of supreme politics. %$* 116
searching for justice. %$* 116
conservatives don't want to be borked again, but they don't want to be soutered, either. %$* 116
we're not willing to buy a pig in a poke. %$* 21
now, live from washington, cnn's inside politics. %$* 116
thanks for joining us. %$* 360
i'm joe johns. %$* 360
we begin with a new development in the case of natalee holloway, the alabama teenager who disappeared in aruba more than a month ago. %$* 360
court officials say a judge has ordered the release of the two of the three suspects. %$* 360
let's go live to cnn's chris lawrence in aruba -- chris? %$* 360
joe, all of the suspects have left the courtroom now. %$* 779
one of them will remain in custody for up to two more months. %$* 779
prosecutors ruling that -- or the judge ruling that prosecutors had enough evidence to keep joran van der sloot in custody. %$* 779
the judge also ruled that two other suspects, deepak and satish kalpoe, should be let go. %$* 779
now, just to give you background on this case, deepak and satish kalpoe said they were in the car with joran van der sloot and natalee holloway on the night she disappeared. %$* 779
they say they drove around for a while and dropped off joran and natalee on a beach. %$* 779
joran van der sloot says that he spent some time with natalee holloway on the beach and then left her and walked home alone. %$* 779
now today, prosecutors argue that the suspects' statement that have changed several times were not sustained by e-mails, by telephone calls, and by text messages, basically saying the statements don't match the other evidence. %$* 779
the judge ruled that perhaps that was the case for joran van der sloot, but he said there was not enough evidence to keep the other two. %$* 779
nothing additional. %$* 780
on the contrary, the more we get, the more it shows that my client has nothing to do with any crime. %$* 780
yes, his client, deepak kalpoe, and his brother, satish, are let go, but this is not the end of it. %$* 779
the prosecutor, we have learned, is considering whether to appeal this decision to let the two brothers go. %$* 779
also, joran van der sloot has up to three days to appeal the judge's decision that he be made to stay. %$* 779
so this may not be the end of it. %$* 779
we'll have to keep our eye on the case over the next couple days -- joe? %$* 779
all right, chris, now, if they let them out, they can re- arrest him if there's new evidence, right? %$* 360
exactly. %$* 779
if new evidence comes to light down the road, much as it can in the united states legal system, people can be re-arrested and brought back into the investigation. %$* 779
great, thanks so much, chris lawrence in aruba. %$* 360
now, to politics. %$* 360
president bush is facing a supreme court vacancy, not to mention the upcoming g-8 summit. %$* 360
but on america's birthday, he stuck to more traditional, patriotic themes, freedom, security, and the nation's armed forces. %$* 360
after a quick fourth of july stop in west virginia, mr. bush is back at the white house, and cnn's bob franken is there. %$* 360
bob, happy fourth of july. %$* 360
happy fourth of july to you, joe. %$* 781
and as you pointed out, the president has a very full plate. %$* 781
he's going to be cramming in anticipation of making an announcement on his nominee to replace sandra day o'connor when he gets back next week, back from the g-8 conference. %$* 781
it's just a massive undertaking. %$* 781
he's traveling to europe tomorrow. %$* 781
but first, today, he wanted to indulge in his newfound independence day tradition, which is to go to west virginia. %$* 781
the last three of four years, he celebrated july 4th in west virginia. %$* 781
the white house only explains it's a nice place to go. %$* 781
and he had a friendly audience of about 3,000 in morgantown at west virginia university. %$* 781
his speech was really a repeat of last week's speech in which he was beginning to try and shore up support for the war in iraq, which has been suffering from a lack of -- a dwindling lack of support in the united states. %$* 781
americans have always held firm because we have always believed in certain truths. %$* 161
we know that the freedom we defend is meant for all men and women and for all times. %$* 161
and we know that when the work is hard, the proper response is not retreat. %$* 161
it is courage. %$* 161
but to reinforce the point that the war in iraq has become a very contentious issue in the united states, a group of about 50 demonstrators appeared outside the hall where the president spoke. %$* 781
now he's back in the white house and the friendly environs where tonight he will watch the fireworks, joe, and get ready for the fireworks in the days, and weeks, and perhaps months ahead -- joe? %$* 781
that's for sure, bob. %$* 360
now, realizing this is the fourth of july holiday, is there any sense there that -- at least a bit of a buzz today about the supreme court, what happens next, what they're doing behind the scenes? %$* 360
well, not a buzz, how about a roar? %$* 781
just about every special-interest group in the world on either side of the political spectrum has geared up for this. %$* 781
they've spent months raising millions to get ready for a battle royale, which is going to be taking place without a doubt once the president names his nominee. %$* 781
he says he wants somebody to be on the court, a replacement for justice o'connor, by october. %$* 781
there's an awful lot of battle ahead before that occurs. %$* 781
great, thanks so much, bob franken at the white house. %$* 360
appreciate it. %$* 360
you know, enjoy the rest of your holiday, bob. %$* 360
during this long holiday weekend, many politicians and activists on both sides of the political spectrum have been drawing lines in the sand over the yet-to-be-named supreme court nominee. %$* 360
one top target of speculation and criticism, attorney general alberto gonzales. %$* 360
he was busy making a surprise visit over the weekend to iraq. %$* 360
some conservatives were effectively declaring war against him. %$* 360
here's our senior political analyst, bill schneider. %$* 360
it wasn't so long ago -- january, in fact -- that democrats were sharply critical of alberto gonzales. %$* 317
that's when the former white house counsel faced senate confirmation hearings for attorney general. %$* 317
questions were raised about his role in the development of what they call the torture memoranda, which overrode the geneva conventions. %$* 324
now gonzales is reported to be on president bush's list of potential nominees to the supreme court. %$* 317
and the criticism is coming from the right. %$* 317
sometimes directly, like a "national review" editorial that said, "conservatives would be appalled and demoralized by a gonzales appointment." %$* 317
sometimes by insinuation, like this comment by the president of the family research council. %$* 317
our opinion or position on attorney general gonzales is that he holds great promise as an attorney general. %$* 418
different job, different issue. %$* 317
for attorney general, it was the rights of terrorist detainees. %$* 317
for supreme court justice, the issue is abortion. %$* 317
gonzales' anti-abortion credentials are suspect to conservatives. %$* 317
as a justice on the texas supreme court, he ruled that a pregnant teenager has the right to seek an abortion without notifying her parents. %$* 317
republican senate aides are reported to joke that gonzales is spanish for "souter." %$* 317
that's a reference to david souter, the justice nominated to the court by president bush's father in 1990. %$* 317
souter refused to answer questions about his views on abortion. %$* 317
conservatives were outraged when souter turned out to support abortion rights. %$* 317
the new vacancy gives conservatives a shot at turning the majority on the court against abortion. %$* 317
they don't want to risk it with another stealth nominee, like souter, so they've begin to rally against gonzales, even though there's no clear indication bush will nominate him. %$* 317
it's interesting to see how people are already posturing to try to characterize what a potential nominee might -- how they might be categorized. %$* 365
the public's view of attorney general gonzales? %$* 317
a new cnn-"usa today"-gallup poll taken before justice o'connor announced her resignation found mildly favorable, but most americans don't know enough about him to have an opinion. %$* 317
if bush were to nominate gonzales, a lot of conservatives would feel betrayed, but many democrats might be relieved. %$* 317
this time, it's all about abortion, different job, different issue. %$* 317
it shows how high the stakes are for this supreme court nomination. %$* 317
conservatives are rallying preemptively against someone the president has not even named -- joe? %$* 317
bill, it has been suggested that the attorney general will at least help out in the vetting process of the eventual nominee, whoever that is, so i take it he will still have some influence, even though he doesn't get the nod? %$* 360
yes, he'll have some influence, but don't forget that was dick cheney's job in 2000. %$* 317
he was vetting nominees for vice president to serve with george bush, and guess who ended up getting that job? %$* 317
that's for sure, dick cheney. %$* 360
all right, thank you very much, bill schneider in los angeles. %$* 360
many americans are watching the supreme court selection process begin to unfold with a sense of its importance, but with a dose of skepticism, too. %$* 360
our national correspondent bruce morton looks at our just-released poll numbers on the search for a justice. %$* 360
washington is in a major league tizzy over the supreme court vacancy, but most americans agree it's a big deal. %$* 321
in a cnn-"usa today"-gallup poll, half our sample said the new justice would matter a great deal to them. %$* 321
and another quarter said it would matter a moderate amount. %$* 321
what do americans expect? %$* 321
one third think it's very likely president bush would appoint someone who would let their religious beliefs inappropriately influence their legal decisions. %$* 321
another 30 percent think that's somewhat likely. %$* 321
would democrats try to block a nominee for inappropriate political reasons? %$* 321
fifty-eight percent think that's very likely, 28 percent somewhat likely, and just 12 percent said it was unlikely. %$* 321
which judges, liberal or conservative, would be more likely to let their personal views influence their legal decisions? %$* 321
that's a tie. %$* 321
forty percent said liberal judges, 39 percent said conservative ones, and the margin of error is plus or minus 3 percent. %$* 321
asked how would you want the new justice to vote on roe v. wade, the decision which legalized a woman's right to abortion, 65 percent wanted a justice who would vote to uphold roe, 29 percent, one would who vote to overturn it in. %$* 321
in a mid-june poll, 41 percent wanted a new justice who would make the court more conservative, 30 percent one who would make it more liberal, 25 percent, one who would keep the court as it is now. %$* 321
and if the president's first choice is unpopular with democrats in the senate, our sample split pretty evenly on whether mr. bush should stick with his nominee or pick somebody more acceptable to the dems. %$* 321
the likely fight over a new supreme comes at a time when public approval of the court is declining. %$* 321
in 2002, 60 percent approved of how the supreme court was handling its job, down to 51 percent in 2004, and just 42 percent now. %$* 321
the decline is true among both democrats and republicans. %$* 321
bruce morton, cnn, washington. %$* 321
a lot of people are already devoting lots of time and energy to the fight over the future of the high court. %$* 360
up next, will efforts to fill the void on the court suck the air out of president bush's legislative agenda? %$* 360
also ahead, a big if, in our "strategy session." %$* 360
is there a real chance the president would tap alberto gonzales to be the next justice? %$* 360
and when we go "inside the blogs," online pundits find new reason to pounce on the question, was there a connection between the leak of a cia operative's name and the white house? %$* 360
with me to talk more about sandra day o'connor's retirement and the looming battle over her replacement is political analyst ron brownstein of the "los angeles times." %$* 360
thanks for coming in on the fourth of july. %$* 360
happy fourth, joe. %$* 320
well, first question, sort of the global question, what happens now that justice o'connor has decided to step down? %$* 360
will that sort of suck the life out of everything else on capitol hill for the foreseeable future? %$* 360
yes, i think it's going to be the dominant issue for the next several weeks. %$* 320
but the one thing -- two points here. %$* 320
first of all, from the point of view of the white house, it's not necessarily a bad thing to change the subject on capitol hill. %$* 320
they've been having a rough spring with their social security proposal, the president's key domestic policy initiative, not getting off the ground. %$* 320
and i think some people in the white house think it won't hurt them to shift the subject for a while. %$* 320
secondly, there's a time limit on this. %$* 320
there's a very real time limit on it. %$* 320
the president has said and his congressional  they want this nominee, whoever it is, confirmed by the first monday in october when the court resumes. %$* 320
so yes, it will take the agenda -- hijack the agenda, in effect, in washington, but it has a limited shelf life. %$* 320
so social security in particular, that's something the administration might have wanted to get on another shelf anyway? %$* 360
well, yes. %$* 320
i think, look, i think both chambers, the house and the senate, republicans are trying to figure out where, if anywhere, they can go on social security. %$* 320
the house republicans have been a little more enthusiastic about voting for this idea of creating accounts out of the social security surplus, but there's really no movement in the senate, really no prospect at the moment of this becoming law. %$* 320
i saw your piece in this morning's newspaper. %$* 360
do you think that republicans and democrats, even a few among them, actually believe that the president will nominate someone who is generally acceptable to both parties? %$* 360
well, i don't think we know. %$* 320
i mean, certainly that's the main argument from democrats, so far. %$* 320
we're hearing the two "c" words, consensus and consultation. %$* 320
i mean, they're sort of making that case. %$* 320
republicans are arguing the president should have a lot of freedom to choose who he picks. %$* 320
there's a lot that has happened over the last few days, in terms of senators and interest groups setting out some of the parameters of the terms of battle, even before we have a nominee. %$* 320
and one point on this i think is really crucial above all, which is that several of the republicans involved in the gang of 14 judicial deal earlier this year, that, as you recall, stopped the effort to ban filibusters, have indicated they don't believe that opposing a nominee because they're too conservative would justify a filibuster by the democrats. %$* 320
lindsey graham on television yesterday, john mccain on cnn friday, both sent a clear shot across the bow of the democrats, warning that if they filibuster a nominee simply because they think he's too conservative, they might come back and join with republicans to ban the filibuster. %$* 320
so that's a pretty important development. %$* 320
there's also a question emerging about the kinds that ought to be asked at a confirmation hearing. %$* 360
are some questions actually going to be off-limits? %$* 360
well, this is really another one of the big debates that have emerged within in the first 72 hours. %$* 320
you've had republicans starting with an op-ed piece by senator john cornyn on saturday in the "washington post" continuing with comments on the sunday shows arguing that it'll be inappropriate to press the eventual nominee too closely for their views on specific issues. %$* 320
democrats have been a little more divided, but the dominant note from people like chuck schumer has been no, that's exactly what they intend to do, that this is a supreme court position that can change daily life, affect daily life for millions of americans, and it is their job to get the nominee on record as much as they can. %$* 320
i think this is going to be one of the real tension points when we get to the hearings down the road. %$* 320
and it will be a very interesting battle to watch. %$* 360
thank you very much, ron brownstein of "l.a. %$* 360
times." %$* 360
turning to our "political bytes" on this fourth of july, support appears to have slipped in recent years for a constitutional amendment that would permit laws against the burning of the american flag. %$* 360
fifty-five percent of those questioned in a recent cnn-"usa today"- gallup poll said they would support an amendment, 42 percent said they would not. %$* 360
back in 1999, 63 percent said they supported the proposed amendment. %$* 360
also in our poll, americans were asked if they are family with the anti-terrorism law known as the patriot act. %$* 360
twelve percent said they very familiar, and 52 percent said somewhat familiar. %$* 360
more than a third said they were not familiar with the law at all. %$* 360
when asked about criticism that the patriot act restricts civil liberties, 30 percent said the law goes too far, while a combined 62 percent said it's either about right or doesn't go far enough. %$* 360
in atlanta today, representatives of the traditionally liberal united church of christ overwhelmingly approved a resolution that endorses same-sex marriage. %$* 360
the vote is non-binding, but is expected to cause some churches to leave the denomination. %$* 360
the united church of christ, with 1.3 million members, is the largest u.s. denomination to back same-sex marriage. %$* 360
and in california, republican congressman duke cunningham canceled a scheduled appearance today at a pancake breakfast in his home district. %$* 360
cunningham is under investigation for selling this san diego-area home to a defense contractor who later sold the house for a loss. %$* 360
a spokesman said cunningham did not want to be a distraction at this morning's event. %$* 360
a new development in the cia leak story is the talk of the internet. %$* 360
coming up next, we'll go "inside the blogs" to see what's being said. %$* 360
now the latest developments in the investigation of the leak of a cia operative's name. %$* 360
"newsweek" is reporting that e-mails between "time" magazine reporter matt cooper and his editors show that karl rove spoke to cooper in the days before valerie plame's identity was revealed in the media. %$* 360
but according to "newsweek," it is not clear what cooper and president bush's top political adviser discussed. %$* 360
karl rove's attorney confirms cooper called his client in july 2003, but he says rove did not disclose any confidential information. %$* 360
and he says the prosecutor has repeatedly confirmed that rove is not a target of the leak. %$* 360
some democrats say rove should publicly deny he was the source of the leak. %$* 360
here's what rove told cnn last august about valerie plame and the investigation. %$* 360
well, i'll repeat what i said to abc news when this whole thing broke some number of months ago. %$* 312
i didn't know her name and didn't leak her name. %$* 312
this is at the justice department. %$* 312
i'm confident that the u.s. attorney, the prosecutor who's involved in looking at this, is going to do a very thorough job of doing a very substantial and conclusive investigation. %$* 312
karl rove and the cia leak story are hot topics in the blogosphere. %$* 360
we check in now with cnn political producer abbi tatton and jackie schechner, our blog reporter -- jacki? %$* 360
hi, joe. %$* 325
well, we thought, after friday's announcement that justice o'connor was retiring, that the upcoming supreme court nomination would be the top story on all the political blogs for some time to come. %$* 325
not so. %$* 325
this news about the "time" magazine disclosure becoming fodder for many of the blogs all across the spectrum throughout the entire weekend. %$* 325
it started when political analyst lawrence o'donnell went on a television program friday night saying that he knew that karl rove was matt cooper's leak. %$* 325
he then went on to the huffingtonpost.com and blogged about it on saturday morning. %$* 325
this made the rounds. %$* 325
we go over today to nastyboys.blogspot.com with a mockup photo -- we should mention that this is not a true photo, a mockup photo -- but this is the sentiment that is resonating, especially on the left-hand side of the blogs, with the title "we can only hope!" %$* 325
please let it be karl rove. %$* 325
lots of bloggers having fun with photoshop there, really having fun with this story. %$* 384
john aravosis over at americablog.org was quick to jump on this, spent most of his saturday rove-blogging. %$* 384
in fact, they've already got t-shirts and mouse pads that say, "karl rove, bye-bye," on them. %$* 384
but as the "newsweek" story came out with michael isikoff reporting, some on the left were not so quick to jump on this one. %$* 384
looking at the details of that case, the fact that the "newsweek" story does say it's unclear what passed between cooper and rove, and saying, "not so fast." %$* 384
at the washingtonmonthly.com, this is kevin drum. %$* 384
he says, "i've looked at the 'newsweek' piece, and there's not a lot there. %$* 384
yes, rove spoke to cooper, but that doesn't mean that he was the source. %$* 384
it doesn't say what he was a source for." %$* 384
more calls for information from lawrence o'donnell again. %$* 325
at the huffington post, he continues to blog. %$* 325
one of the updates he's posted, he wants karl rove to tell us what he told the grand jury. %$* 325
he thinks that's going to be very telling. %$* 325
right. %$* 384
and that offer there, what they were trying to do over at the -- mcdonnell  was saying over there caused this conservative blog, wizbangblog.com, to say, "why is it rove's job to prove that he didn't leak it?" %$* 384
suggesting that the people over there don't have the information they're claiming. %$* 384
so that's the information that's coming out on the right. %$* 325
they're saying they think rove has nothing to worry about at this point. %$* 325
we'll see how this evolves over the days and weeks to come -- joe? %$* 325
abbi and jacki, thank you. %$* 360
as president bush searches for a nominee for the u.s. supreme court, some advocates know who they want and others know what they don't want. %$* 360
coming up, we'll look at justice souter as the anti-role model for some conservatives, and we'll put his name and others up for discussion in our "strategy session." %$* 360
now that president bush is working toward naming his first supreme court nominee, some are urging him not to follow in his father's footsteps. %$* 360
many conservatives have been disappointed with justice david souter's moderate to liberal voting record on the high court, and some still hold a grudge against george herbert walker bush for nominating the paper trail-less souter 15 years ago. %$* 360
our senior political correspondent candy crowley has more on souter, the bushes, and the high court legacies. %$* 360
they are lifetime appointments, which can make history and shape legacies. %$* 164
i tell you how i look at this, not in terms of some specific imprint, but i want it said when i'm about 90, 24 years from now, that i made a superb choice, and i think it will be so writ. %$* 161
he's not 90 yet, but history so far, as written by conservatives, is not so writ. %$* 164
it's turned out to be quite a disappointment, because mr. souter is clearly squarely in the middle of the liberal camp, that -- the liberal majority, actually, on the supreme court. %$* 782
conservative groups know what they want in a supreme court nominee -- someone who will protect the unborn -- and they know what they don't want, another justice souter. %$* 164
i don't think this president bush wants to be embarrassed by his court nominee. %$* 114
souter is not the first supreme court nominee to backfire on supporters. %$* 164
president eisenhower called chief justice earl warren "my biggest mistake." %$* 164
one of the most active courts in history, the warren court overturned the notion of separate but equal public education and ordered school desegregation. %$* 164
conservative president nixon was "soutered" by justice harry blackmun, author of the majority opinion in the roe v. wade decision, which legalized abortion. %$* 164
conservatives say souter got by them because he didn't have much of a paper trail on their issues, and they took his conservative judicial bent on the faith of republicans who vouched for him. %$* 164
this time around, no blind dates. %$* 164
this court is very narrowly divided on many issues of great interest to us -- on the sanctity of life, the sanctity of marriage. %$* 782
and with a court that's divided 5-4 on so many of those cases, we're not willing to buy a pig in a poke. %$* 782
and so we want someone whose judicial philosophy and whose jurisprudence is well- known and established. %$* 782
paper trails may reduce the high court's surprise rate, but they won't eliminate it. %$* 164
there is something about the view at the supreme court that can change a jurist. %$* 164
candy crowley, cnn, washington. %$* 164
people were taking sides on the next supreme court justice long before justice o'connor said she would retire. %$* 360
what kind of strategies will be employed in the fight for that seat on the bench? %$* 360
our "strategy session" is the perfect place for that discussion. %$* 360
here today, democratic strategist vic kamber and bay buchanan, president of american cause. %$* 360
thanks for being here. %$* 360
sure. %$* 422
sure. %$* 783
a supreme court showdown ahead, as the senate awaits the president's choice for the next justice for the u.s. supreme court. %$* 360
from the justice department to the high court, is attorney general alberto gonzales on the short list? %$* 360
and the connection between a key white house insider, a "time" magazine correspondent uncovering an undercover cia agent. %$* 360
now, let's get to the top of this, of course, and the first thing is supreme court nominations. %$* 360
the central question and the one people are asking right now is whether because there was an agreement between 14 senators several week ago, a filibuster's precluded. %$* 360
what's your view? %$* 360
do you think -- vic, i should start with you, because you're a democrat -- that a filibuster is almost off the table, barring extraordinary circumstances, whatever that is? %$* 360
simple answer is yes. %$* 783
but we don't know -- no one's defined extraordinary circumstances. %$* 783
we don't know what the issues may be. %$* 783
and we don't know the nominee. %$* 783
my guts tell me that the president -- if i were advising the president, that's unlikely to happen, as we all know. %$* 783
i would advise that we try to pick a consensus candidate. %$* 783
he's going to be or she's going to be a conservative. %$* 783
there's no doubt about that. %$* 783
but someone that can pass. %$* 783
he's not running for reelection again. %$* 783
he doesn't need to please a certain element of his own party. %$* 783
he needs to please the country. %$* 783
and he please the country when he picks somebody that he's told the country he would pick. %$* 422
when he ran as a candidate, he said somebody in the mold of a scalia. %$* 422
and that is what -- his supporters are totally energized over this right now. %$* 422
they're very exciting times, that we are actually going to get somebody that we really believe should be a supreme court justice. %$* 422
and i think that's why the president will commit. %$* 422
he has a commitment. %$* 422
he will make that commitment. %$* 422
he will say here you go, this is a scalia-like fellow i'm putting forward, i know this is in the best interest of country, because that's what he believes. %$* 422
somebody who shares his philosophy. %$* 422
and i think it's good politics, it's smart politics for him to do exactly that and let's see what the democrats do. %$* 422
perhaps not just a fella. %$* 360
there's there's been a lot of talk about janice rodgers brown in this town right now. %$* 360
and some democrats have actually been suggesting that she's the type of candidate who could trigger a filibuster. %$* 360
what happens if democrats open this pandora's box? %$* 360
see, i think that's why he's in a win-win situation. %$* 422
he comes up with exactly who thinks should be in there. %$* 422
and he puts that person forward and lets the democrats decide if they want to risk a filibuster, we have a supreme court justice. %$* 422
every supreme court nominee has had an up-or-down vote in this country. %$* 422
and the american people think that's fair, to have a fair hearing and a fair up-or-down vote. %$* 422
and so i think the democrats would make a real mistake to go filibuster. %$* 422
if they did that, i think the president one-ups them and says fine, we're taking out your opportunity to filibuster judges. %$* 422
before we get to the vote, we also have the issue of a confirmation hearing. %$* 360
and there's a lot of talk, as well, about the types of questions that might be asked of a nominee. %$* 360
do you think that certain questions ought to be off-limits, victor? %$* 360
not at all. %$* 783
there's nothing that should be off the table. %$* 783
this is a lifetime appointment. %$* 783
these are appointments that can affect your life, my life, every life in this country. %$* 783
i think there's nothing that should be off the table and not asked. %$* 783
obviously, if they're a sitting judge or a sitting justice, we're going to have their records and we have to analyze what they said and why they said it and what it means, whether it's pro-life, pro-choice, pro-guns, anti-guns. %$* 783
whatever the issue may be, i think any issue is on the table. %$* 783
and we know which -- i'm sorry to say we come into -- their personal lives are on the table. %$* 783
all the background of who you are, what you are, what made you up, is on the table and is open to the scrutiny. %$* 783
you know, i think the key here is i think the republicans are playing very smart ball. %$* 422
i agree with vic. %$* 422
you shouldn't tell a u.s. senator you can or can't ask certain questions. %$* 422
and so any question can be asked. %$* 422
but what the republicans are saying is that they're going to strongly stress that the candidate does not answer personal questions, questions about their personal beliefs. %$* 422
because it's not relevant as a judge. %$* 422
and that's where i think the democrats are going to look like they're looking for a problem, looking for trouble. %$* 422
character, of course, is an issue. %$* 422
ethics is an issue. %$* 422
but your personal philosophy should not be an issue that's before the senate. %$* 422
if i may, the interesting thing is you can set the scenario today of what should be the case, how you should answer. %$* 783
i can brief you all i want how you should answer. %$* 783
the bottom line is you're sitting there with 20 or 21 senators from both parties, nine and 11, they're going to ask their questions. %$* 783
and a joe biden or a chris dodd or a ted kennedy, are not going to sit there and take a shaking head, gee, i can't answer that, because that goes too far. %$* 783
they're just not going to take that. %$* 783
these are smart guys who can handle that. %$* 422
they can handle it easily. %$* 422
stay right there. %$* 360
we'll be right back to talk to some more of this. %$* 360
how much history will be attached to the president's choice for the supreme court? %$* 360
could attorney general alberto gonzales be the court's first hispanic justice? %$* 360
we'll talk about that when inside politics continues. %$* 360
the "strategy session" continues on inside politics. %$* 360
with us today, vic kamber and bay buchanan. %$* 360
president bush could make history by naming his attorney general and long-time friend to the supreme court. %$* 360
alberto gonzales made a quick trip to iraq this weekend, consulting with justice department staff there to help with the prosecution of saddam hussein and other former iraqi leaders. %$* 360
the mention of gonzales as a possible court choice has some questioning his conservative credentials, and that's even though most americans still don't know him. %$* 360
only 32 percent have a favorable opinion of gonzales in the latest cnn/"usa today"/gallup poll, with more than one half unsure of what they think of him. %$* 360
so bottom line question, is alberto gonzales that bad, bay buchanan? %$* 360
yes. %$* 422
he would be a terrible, terrible choice for the president. %$* 422
you know, you got to remember that the backbone of this republican majority is their social conservatives in the country. %$* 422
and they have said, listen, we want somebody socially conservative, and -- but specifically we do not want gonzales. %$* 422
they are coming -- they have unified and said gonzales is unacceptable to us. %$* 422
and so why would the president go right in their face and upset these millions and millions of people who are really the backbone and are going to be energized for next year's election or deflated? %$* 422
and the question, i guess, for you is, on the democratic side, a lot of people have said he is the best choice democrats think they could get. %$* 360
well, i think the president should -- will think twice about two things. %$* 783
one, can he get a confirmation without a major fight? %$* 783
and two, what's his legislative agenda while he's still president? %$* 783
he doesn't have to stand for election again, so while he is a social conservative himself, while he will please the conservatives -- and, as i said earlier, he will name a conservative. %$* 783
he's got to name somebody that he thinks can get confirmed. %$* 783
the attorney general happens to be somebody he likes personally, he knows personally, he trusts. %$* 783
it makes eminent sense to pick the attorney general. %$* 783
we don't know -- what bay is talking about is primarily on pro-life. %$* 783
we don't know where he is on the pro-life issue question, frankly. %$* 783
and no senator yet, republican, has said they will not vote for gonzales. %$* 783
we know he's hesitant. %$* 422
his record shows that he has at times been hesitant on the pro-life issue. %$* 422
which may make for a great justice. %$* 783
it may for somebody that you think is good. %$* 422
but then, if i don't, why would president bush please you versus those who share my philosophy? %$* 422
also figure into the equation, the next election up is the mid-term. %$* 360
exactly. %$* 422
that's an election of 30-some odd united states senators. %$* 422
if we have a meltdown on capitol hill on the issue of this judicial nomination, doesn't that create some real room for volatility in the next election? %$* 422
but you've got to understand where he's coming from. %$* 422
what does the president -- what does the republican party need next year? %$* 422
they need a base that's very spirited and excited and understands why they should vote republican. %$* 422
what better reason than the judges? %$* 422
that has always been a primary reason for social conservatives. %$* 422
the president gives them their guy, they think, my gosh, we could have won one or two more. %$* 422
we've got to make certain that he keeps them in power. %$* 422
it is all win-win for the president. %$* 422
joe, it depends on how it melts down. %$* 783
that's the problem in the senate. %$* 783
depends on -- and bay said earlier, if they take away the filibuster and the republicans play it a certain way, maybe democrats get hurt. %$* 783
i don't think so. %$* 783
i think it's just the opposite. %$* 783
if they take away the filibuster to get their supreme court nomination, i think democrats will gain in the next session. %$* 783
bay, do you think it's no gonzales ever? %$* 360
or is it no gonzales for this seat? %$* 360
that's an excellent point. %$* 422
having watched this president for some time, i can see him saying, ok, give the social conservatives this one, they're going to be really excited. %$* 422
and my friend, who i may have had made a commitment to here -- we don't know -- we'll move him. %$* 422
because we're going to have a second one here pretty quickly. %$* 422
we might move him a little bit later. %$* 422
i see that as a possibility. %$* 422
but i'll tell you quite honestly, the social conservatives are going to be wanting every one. %$* 422
they're not going to back off and say, ok, we got one. %$* 422
they're going to say, oh, no, mr. president, we want the next one. %$* 422
this is his legacy. %$* 422
joe, that's the thing to remember. %$* 422
and the president being a social conservative wants to create that legacy. %$* 422
it's there for years to come. %$* 422
and i agree with bay. %$* 783
he could have nine appointments and they're never going to back off. %$* 783
they're going to want every one... %$* 783
why should we? %$* 422
we've got the white house. %$* 422
i didn't say you should. %$* 783
but he, he, is the president looking at his legacy and he's going to want to make his statement. %$* 783
and i think putting the first latino hispanic-american on the bench will be one of his legacies. %$* 783
sure. %$* 422
estrada. %$* 422
works well for me. %$* 422
of course, who knows, though, when supreme court chief justice william rehnquist will retire. %$* 360
when we return, is there a connection between the president's top political adviser and a reporter at "time" magazine? %$* 360
karl rove and the investigation into a cia operative's identity was revealed when the "strategy session" resumes. %$* 360
i'm john king reporting from washington. %$* 53
coming up at the top of the hour, an aruba judge releases two of the suspects in the disappearance of natalee holloway. %$* 53
we'll have the latest. %$* 53
president bush mulls a supreme court nomination. %$* 53
will he pick an opponent of roe v. wade? %$* 53
and two days after the rescue of shasta groene, the search continues for her 9-year-old brother dylan. %$* 53
we'll have a live report from idaho. %$* 53
all those stories and much more, just minutes away on "wolf blitzer reports." %$* 53
now back to inside politics. %$* 53
the "strategy session" continues on inside politics. %$* 360
bay buchanan and vic kamber are here now with their take on the investigation of a leak that revealed a cia operative's identity. %$* 360
"newsweek" says bush adviser karl rove talked with a "time" magazine reporter days before valerie plame's name was revealed in the media. %$* 360
rove's attorney says rove did not disclose plame's identity and he says the prosecutor has repeatedly confirmed that rove is not a target of the leak investigation. %$* 360
but at least one senator, new york democrat chuck schumer, is calling on rove to speak for himself on the issue. %$* 360
so is this going to stick to karl rove or does it really matter? %$* 360
let me say, i have enormous respect for bob luskin , who is karl rove's attorney. %$* 783
and if luskin got up and said he didn't do it, i'm going to take luskin at his word at this point in time. %$* 783
we know that karl rove likes to talk to the press. %$* 783
in spite of a white house that claims nobody should be talking to the press, he usually does it on background. %$* 783
so there's no great surprise that he talked to this reporter. %$* 783
but i will accept at this point, unless we know something different, that he probably wasn't the source of the leak. %$* 783
i agree. %$* 422
and there's no reason whatsoever that karl rove should respond to chuck schumer. %$* 422
i mean, he's just, you know, an angry partisan out there who was trying to tie this thing together. %$* 422
but, you know, in fairness to karl rove, he made the statement a year ago that he did not know this name and he did not leak this name. %$* 422
and his attorney says that he's not involved and he didn't do anything. %$* 422
i think that's where it stands. %$* 422
the shame of the problem is that a year ago or six months ago, the office -- the white house or rove should have let it be known that he spoke to the reporter. %$* 783
and we shouldn't had to find it out by leaks in terms of the reporter about to announce or "time" about to give the name away rather than go to jail. %$* 783
that's the suspicion here. %$* 783
is this an inside the beltway thing? %$* 360
is this something that people, once you get in the real country, don't care about at all? %$* 360
i agree with you, joe, i don't think anyone cares one way or the other. %$* 422
i think, if indeed, there were evidence that were to surface that somebody in the white house, for instance, was tied to this investigation, then you've got a story. %$* 422
but there's no evidence. %$* 422
and the people who were there saying, no, there's no evidence whatsoever and i didn't do it. %$* 422
i think it stays there. %$* 422
it's no story until something more comes... %$* 422
it's inside the beltway unless he did it. %$* 783
exactly. %$* 422
and if he did it, then we'll all know about it. %$* 422
right. %$* 783
but there's also potential for real repercussions for reporters. %$* 422
this administration, for him. %$* 783
well, the reporter, i understand... %$* 783
that's a very good point. %$* 422
but i understand the reporter has said he's releasing the information. %$* 783
or "time" has asked the reporter now to release the information to the judge. %$* 783
so i think we're going to know, or at least the judge will know, very shortly who, in fact, was the source. %$* 783
but then you have to ask about lawrence o'donnell . %$* 422
why would somebody of his caliber go on national television and say it was rove if he doesn't have the evidence? %$* 422
johns:  that's quite clear. %$* 422
the other interesting thing that's very interesting about this is some journalists actually apparently got some agreement or dispensation from the source, got released from the source to go ahead and at least give some partial testimony. %$* 422
and this is a far cry, is it not, from the days of deep throat? %$* 422
well, i mean, the times are changing, our way of collecting information in the journalism circles have changed. %$* 783
and many people, frankly, want their stories out -- or whistleblowers, whatever you want to call them - and they're willing to give some kind of freedom to the journalists to do it, in order to get that story out. %$* 783
the other thing, though. %$* 360
before we go away from you, i do have to sort of asking the bottom-line question, going back to judicial nominees. %$* 360
and that is a question of who, at the end of the day, do you think is president bush's best choice from the conservative point of view, bay? %$* 360
i don't know. %$* 422
there's five or six names out there that make us very, very happy. %$* 422
and so i think the president has to look at it and make his own call. %$* 422
but it has to be somebody who's a social conservative or that we have reason to believe shares his philosophy on these issues. %$* 422
fire-breathing or more moderate in tone? %$* 360
well, you know, your judicial individuals generally are more moderate in tone. %$* 422
there's occasionally we find a scalia out there and we all cheer. %$* 422
but generally speaking, they could be -- it doesn't matter in their tone. %$* 422
it's their vote that matters. %$* 422
if i was advising the president, i would go with the senator from texas that was on the... %$* 783
john cornyn? %$* 360
that's correct. %$* 783
why? %$* 360
because he has judicial temperament, he knows the president, i think he could get confirmed in the senate. %$* 783
and while i would totally disagree with his positions and do, the issue for him, as i said earlier, is confirmation. %$* 783
thanks so much, vic kamber, bay buchanan. %$* 360
appreciate your coming in, and happy fourth of july. %$* 360
same to you. %$* 783
same to you. %$* 422
you bet. %$* 360
just ahead, military bloggers assist families whose loved ones are deployed in war zones. %$* 360
we will check in once again with our blog reporters to see how blogs are being used as a critical resource for sharing information. %$* 360
military bloggers are emerging as a critical resource for friends and families of those on active duty. %$* 360
for more, once again we check in with cnn political producer abbi tatton and jacki schechner, our blog reporter -- jacki. %$* 360
hi, joe. %$* 325
we've talked about military bloggers here before several times. %$* 325
we thought that the fourth of july was a good opportunity to go back and find someone abroad who was blogging to his friends back home. %$* 325
over at the nationalguardexperience.blogspot.com, he's a guardsman who's deployed in afghanistan. %$* 325
and he actually posted a poem, written by a friend of his, in order to celebrate the fourth of july. %$* 325
but here at home, most people are concerned about the news coming out of afghanistan, and that specifically being the helicopter that went down last week and then the four navy seals who have gone missing. %$* 325
and there seems to be the go-to site on this story in the blogging community and that is froggyruminations.blogspot.com, run by two former navy seals, matthew hyde  and scott king  who, since this post last wednesday, a day of mourning for the seal/night stalker community, have really been devoting their site to new stories, updates. %$* 384
but it's really the comments section which is so interesting on this story. %$* 384
members of the navy seal community, friends, family, are weighing in, talking to each other, helping each other through this very difficult time. %$* 384
one of them, a sister of a navy seal saying, we are just sick to the stomach waiting to hear names, describing how some of the wives are scared to call other wives just in case they have had bad news. %$* 384
at froggyruminations, there are also links to various associations connected with the navy seals, where you can, in his words, support your protectors. %$* 384
so what are the political bloggers doing? %$* 325
many of them are very simply putting the declaration of independence on their site or linking to it, saying now is very important time and good time to think about freedom and what it means. %$* 325
joe, we'll send it back to you. %$* 325
happy fourth. %$* 325
thanks, abbi and jacki. %$* 360
that's it for inside politics. %$* 360

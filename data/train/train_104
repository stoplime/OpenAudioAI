welcome back to "inside politics." %$* 53
a live picture there, cincinnati, ohio. %$* 53
the 107th annual convention of the naacp. %$* 53
hillary clinton, the democratic nominee, soon-to-be democratic nominee for president, expected to address that group. %$* 53
she's running a little late. %$* 53
when she speaks, cnn will take you there live. %$* 53
proves the point that this is donald trump's big week, but that doesn't mean that hillary will completely yield the stage. %$* 53
you'll see her there courting african-american voters. %$* 53
she also has some important outreach to labor unions this week. %$* 53
and guess what, by the time the week is over, she needs to do what donald trump did last week. %$* 53
donald trump put mike pence on the republican ticket. %$* 53
hillary clinton has to make her choice to fill the democratic ticket. %$* 53
so, it used to be tradition that the other party kind of was quiet, but now that the conventions are back to back, because the stakes are so high and because the election is so close, hillary clinton will be big in the news this week. %$* 53
number one, let's start with, she's going to respond to baton rouge, she's going to talk about this crisis in america. %$* 53
a trust crisis and a violence crisis in our communities. %$* 53
inside the clinton campaign, what do they think the best contrast to donald trump is? %$* 53
i think that you're going to see her pick up on some of the comments that republicans broadly have been making. %$* 170
another president has been making about police, and about the need to show more respect for police, and obviously, not turn this anger against law enforcement. %$* 170
but i also think you're going to see her look at this through a racial lens in a way that republicans are still a bit uncomfortable with. %$* 170
and i think you're going to hear her talking about broader issues that inflict communities and how these divisions that we're seeing so publicly this summer, how they are really so built in right now. %$* 170
and these are tensions that have built up over a decade, so look for a broader message from her than simply law enforcement. %$* 170
and i mentioned criminal justice reform earlier. %$* 146
this has now become a big part of her campaign, particularly in the primary campaign as she tried to sort of distance herself from 19 -- from the bill clinton's crime bill in the early '90s that a lot of folks in the african-american community believe have led to this approach, this tension within inner city communities. %$* 146
so, watch her make that case, that there needs to be some reform to the criminal justice system. %$* 146
and some of that probably maybe not mentioned a whole lot tonight here ... %$* 146
and that's one of the remarkable -- i called it "parallel universe" the two parties live in, is if you're hillary clinton, you're looking at two obama victories and you're trying to appeal to that coalition. %$* 53
if you're donald trump and you're trying to, number one, assert yourself as a conservative, it's very different tone under very the same issue. %$* 53
let's stick on secretary clinton, though. %$* 53
she -- if you look at battleground state polling, she's in pretty good shape. %$* 53
most national polls have her with a narrow lead in this race, with a very narrow lead. %$* 53
this is a very competitive race. %$* 53
and like donald trump, she has some issues. %$* 53
here's one of them. %$* 53
our new cnn/orc poll among bernie sanders voters, people who supported bernie sanders in the primaries, clinton now gets 57 percent of their votes, donald trump gets 5 percent. %$* 53
gary johnson, the libertarian candidate, gets 23 percent of the votes and jill stein, the green party candidate, 12 percent of the votes. %$* 53
now, bernie sanders just endorsed her last week. %$* 53
she had the fbi director dump on her pretty hard just a little more than a week ago. %$* 53
so maybe some of this is a reaction, and maybe these numbers are a little higher than some other polls. %$* 53
but if 40 percent of bernie sanders' voters are shopping elsewhere, that's a problem. %$* 53
it's a huge problem for her because we talk about the obama coalition, young people were a major part of the obama coalition. %$* 170
they were active supporters for bernie sanders. %$* 170
and i actually talked to a lot of young voters last week, was calling around. %$* 170
and gary johnson and jill stein are in the mix for young voters. %$* 170
they do not see this as a two-way race between hillary clinton and donald trump. %$* 170
that's scary if you're hillary clinton. %$* 170
but i also think that's why you're seeing the re-emergence of elizabeth warren a little bit. %$* 189
she met with hillary, i believe it was earlier this week. %$* 189
i feel like everything is blending together at this point. %$* 189
but she also was in a tweet storm against donald trump again and is very much putting herself out there again. %$* 189
so, keeping her in contention cannot hold hillary clinton . %$* 189
a number like that, if you keep thinking at this point, ok, where are the pressures on hillary clinton? %$* 53
what does she need to fill the ticket, balance the ticket, get deal with a weakness, fortify a strength? %$* 53
that's the calculation you go through. %$* 53
you made the point, we had elizabeth warren, well, let's look at some of the people in the contention. %$* 53
that's governor hickenlooper of colorado came to see hillary clinton last week. %$* 53
tim kaine, the virginia senator she was with on the campaign trail. %$* 53
tom vilsack, not the agriculture secretary, former iowa governor. %$* 53
you see elizabeth warren right there in the middle. %$* 53
no accident, i guess, that she's there. %$* 53
the housing and urban development -- excuse me secretary julian castro. %$* 53
and the labor secretary, tom perez. %$* 53
now, people were saying, if she want to make outreach to latinos, you look at castro or perez. %$* 53
but if your number one issue is blue-collar, working voters, i think two speeches to labor unions this weekend as well. %$* 53
if that's your issue, and if you talk to michigan democrats, they tell you they are freaked. %$* 53
autoworker, people like that, that the polling might say one thing. %$* 53
they say you sit down in a bar with these guys and they are not voting for hillary clinton. %$* 53
there could be one issue with going with tim kaine, because he was a supporter of free trade agreements, supporter of the trade proportion authority that passed, you know, in this congress. %$* 146
so, that's one of the risk and that's one of reasons why she may be looking at some more popular democrats, people like sherrod brown of ohio, who is not on that list. %$* 146
but he also has a problem because john kasich is the governor of his state who is named his internal replacement. %$* 146
and any of these people are going to be problematic in one way or another because if you pick someone, you're giving something else up. %$* 196
so if you're going after this white sort of reagan, you know, so-called reagan democrats, then you're going to aim for a different pick than if you're looking at sort of uniting a minority coalition of barack obama coalition behind you. %$* 196
but, you know, i remain skeptical of how much of a demographic group or how much of a state any v.p. %$* 196
picks feel, you know, will really bring you on a ticket. %$* 196
i think elizabeth warren is sort of the "x" factor in all of that. %$* 196
she's proven herself to be a very capable attack dog against donald trump. %$* 196
and she speaks to the bernie sanders voters in a way that i don't think anyone else on that list we would looking at, well he does. %$* 196
but the question has always been, would hillary clinton do that? %$* 53
would she pick somebody who in some ways might overshadow her? %$* 53
it's very hard to see elizabeth warren, in particular because she needs also a governing partner. %$* 146
how does she work with someone who's -- has a lot of different issues in her, someone who's clearly not a dealmaker? %$* 146
and when you're a governor -- when you're governing and you're an executive, you have to be a dealmaker. %$* 146
i agree because -- i mean it's less likely that she picks warren than any of the other candidates on that list. %$* 170
but one thing to keep in mind, in clinton headquarters, there is nothing that has energized that group of people more than elizabeth warren and seeing how she gets under donald trump's skin. %$* 170
they think she is incredibly effective, more effective than anyone else, really. %$* 170
one other interesting thing that we're going to see this week is the president of the united states. %$* 53
and the white house said today, this is just a coincidence. %$* 53
it's a part of the calendar, the president's having an vent to mark a key date on the muslim religious calendar this week. %$* 53
but then on friday, the day after the republican convention ends, the president of mexico is coming to the white house. %$* 53
now, the white house says this is just a coincidence, that after donald trump's convention. %$* 53
and i think we're going to hear at least once or twice that he would like to build a wall and he wants mexico to pay for it. %$* 53
is this mischief by the president? %$* 53
you can only look at that way, because if you remember, these two leaders just met a few weeks ago in canada at a north american leader's summit. %$* 170
it's not as though they haven't seen each other in a while. %$* 170
so, the timing of this is curious. %$* 170
and, you know, that goes back to the v.p. %$* 146
picks. %$* 146
they're either few hispanic potential candidates on that list. %$* 146
she may not even need to go that route to get the latino vote, you don't need to go that ralph because trump is doing very, very poorly way worse than mitt romney did who only got, what 27 percent of the vote in 2012? %$* 146
and we saw what happened to him, especially in those key battleground states. %$* 146
if you could look behind me in the floor, you could see it's starting to fill in. %$* 53
the republican convention will be gaveled to order in about 23 minutes, if my math is right. %$* 53
you see the delegates starting to fill in to the halls. %$* 53
it's an exciting time here in cleveland. %$* 53
up next, our reporter share from their notebooks, including a series of surprises that top convention planners, well, let's just say, they have no choice but to smile and embrace. %$* 53
we'll still waiting for secretary of state, former secretary of state hillary clinton to speak to the naacp in cincinnati, ohio. %$* 53
we are told she is just moments away. %$* 53
we'll take you there live once she starts to speak. %$* 53
as always on "inside politics," let's go around the table here, ask our reporters to share little something from their notebooks, get you out ahead of the big political news just around the corner. %$* 53
manu? %$* 53
we talked about john kasich earlier in the show and the trump campaign not happy with him. %$* 146
but also a number of ohio delegates are not happy with him either. %$* 146
i talked to some of them, including the republican congressman from the cleveland area jim renacci, who told me, "i think republicans too many times are happy with the laws to prove a point versus coming together to win." %$* 146
you're hearing a message of unity and some frustration from republicans here in ohio about their governor. %$* 146
king: about their governor. %$* 146
ok, we'll see if john kasich changes his plans, but doesn't look like it. %$* 146
he's a pretty stubborn guy. %$* 146
i've known him for a while. %$* 146
julie? %$* 146
donald trump advisers say, one of the reasons that he's excited about having mike pence on the ticket is because pence likes to fundraise. %$* 170
trump is getting more comfortable with the idea of asking people for money but still loathes the process in general. %$* 170
and one adviser told me that when trump learned of pence's fundraising skills, he turned to pence and said "do i have a job for you?" %$* 170
so this can come both ways. %$* 170
there are some donors who might like to hear from pence more than trump. %$* 170
but donors also like to know that the top of the ticket is invested. %$* 170
so he risks turning this completely over to pence. %$* 170
what we do know, the republicans are behind his money, so that matters. %$* 53
sara? %$* 53
well, all eyes of course are here on that convention, but while this is happening, the trump campaign is preparing for this august push in battleground states. %$* 196
now, they've of course gotten a lot of flack about their ground game and not having as much of a presence as clinton. %$* 196
they say they're never going to have as big of a footprint as hillary clinton and barack obama, but they don't need it. %$* 196
but they are going to release today a list of state directors, advisers in more than dozen battleground states that include places like michigan and maine. %$* 196
they feel like they're laying the groundwork. %$* 196
and you're going to see much more of the traditional blocking and tackling starting in august. %$* 196
and they are pushing back hard against this narrative that they are anywhere behind in the ground game. %$* 196
jackie? %$* 53
donald trump has promised a convention full of surprises, but usually you don't have the rnc also being surprised. %$* 189
this time, they're having to kind of go with the flow because they're dealing with a nominee who is extending invitations and deciding, he's going to show up whenever he wants. %$* 189
look at scott baio, working on the program until very recently and that's because donald trump just invited him. %$* 189
so, we're all just kind of waiting with bated breath and the includes the rnc. %$* 189
when it comes to scott baio, a lot expecting and the answer but a "why". %$* 53
why not? %$* 189
i guess we'll find out right there. %$* 53
now, who's not here in cleveland, this is is as big of a part of conversation as who is attending. %$* 53
many republican luminaries, you probably heard, are skipping, including the two living former republican presidents, george h.w. %$* 53
bush and george w. bush, or as called in family lingo, 41 and 43. %$* 53
they will not be here in cleveland, but they were also not in tampa for mitt romney four years ago. %$* 53
as you see things happen there. %$* 53
for 41, george w. bush, that ended his streak of appearing at eight consecutive gop conventions. %$* 53
another bush family streak ends this week here in cleveland. %$* 53
the two presidents' bush did not speak in capitol four years ago, but jeb bush did. %$* 53
jeb bush also isn't coming to donald trump's coronation. %$* 53
you might remember, they don't like each other, and so this streak will end right here. %$* 53
at least one bush has spoken at every republican convention since 1980. %$* 53
we're still waiting to hear hillary clinton speaking in cincinnati. %$* 53
she is speaking now at the naacp convention. %$* 53
let's listen. %$* 53
more black men killed in police incidents, this time in louisiana and minnesota. %$* 149
and then in dallas, five police officers killed while serving and protecting peaceful protesters, targeted because they were police. %$* 149
and then, of course, yesterday, three police officers murdered in an apparent premeditated ambush in baton rouge. %$* 149
this madness has to stop. %$* 149
watching the news from baton rouge yesterday, my heart broke. %$* 149
not just for those officers and their grieving families, but for all of us. %$* 149
we have difficult, painful, essential work ahead of us to repair the bonds between our police and our communities and between and among each other. %$* 149
we need one another to do this work. %$* 149
and we need leaders like the naacp. %$* 149
we need police officers to help us make progress. %$* 149
these murders threaten all of that. %$* 149
killing police officers is a terrible crime. %$* 149
that's why our laws treat the murders of police so seriously, because they represent the rule of law itself. %$* 149
if you take aim at that and at them, you take aim at all of us. %$* 149
anyone who kills a police officer and anyone who helps must be held accountable. %$* 149
and as president, i will bring the fool weight of the law to there and making sure those who kill police officers are brought to justice. %$* 149
there can be no justification, no looking the other way. %$* 149
we all have to make sure and pray it ends. %$* 149
the officers killed yesterday in baton rouge were named montrell jackson, matthew gerald, brad garafola. %$* 149
when they died, they were responding to a call about a man with a gun. %$* 149
how many families, how many more families would be paying the price if we did not have brave men and women answering those calls? %$* 149
that's why i'm haunted by the image of what the officers in dallas were doing when they died, protecting a peaceful march, talking with the protesters. %$* 149
where would our democracy be without courageous people willing to do that? %$* 149
so we all need to be partners in making law enforcement as secure and effective as it needs to be. %$* 149
that means investing in our police, in training on the proper use of force, especially lethal force, how to avoid using force to resolve incidents. %$* 149
officer safety and wellness, everything they need to do their jobs right and rebuild trust with their communities. %$* 149
i've said from the beginning of my campaign, that will be my priority as president. %$* 149
and perhaps the best way to honor our police is to follow the lead of police departments across the country who are striving to do better. %$* 149
the deaths of alton and philando drove home how urgently we need to make reforms to policing and criminal justice. %$* 149
how we cannot rest until we root out implicit bias and stop the killings of african- americans. %$* 149
because there is, as you know so well, another hard truth at the heart of this complex matter. %$* 149
many african-americans fear the police. %$* 149
i can hear you. %$* 149
some of you in this room. %$* 149
and today there are people all across america sick over what happened in baton rouge and in dallas but also fearful that the murders of police officers means that vital questions about police-community relations will go unanswered. %$* 149
now, that is a reasonable fear, isn't it? %$* 149
and all of this tells us very powerfully that we have to change. %$* 149
many police officers across the country agree with that. %$* 149
but it can only happen if we build trust and accountability. %$* 149
and let's admit it that gets harder every time someone else is killed. %$* 149
and let's admit it, there is clear evidence that african-americans are disproportionately killed in police incidents, compared to any other group. %$* 736
and african-american men are far more likely to be stopped and searched by police, charged with crimes and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men convicted of the same offenses. %$* 736
these facts tell us something is profoundly wrong. %$* 736
we can't ignore that. %$* 736
we can't wish it away. %$* 736
we have to make it right. %$* 736
that means end- to-end reform in our criminal justice system, not half measures, but a full commitment with real follow-through. %$* 736
that's why the very first speech i gave in this campaign back in april of 2015 was about criminal justice reform. %$* 736
and the next president should make a commitment to fight for the reforms we so desperately need. %$* 736
holding police departments like ferguson accountable. %$* 736
requiring accurate data on in-custody deaths, like sandra bland. %$* 736
creating clear national guidelines on the use of force, especially lethal force. %$* 736
supporting independent investigations of fatal encounters with the police. %$* 736
so, i pledge to you, i will start taking action on day one and every day after that until we get this done. %$* 736
and you know what? %$* 736
when the 24-hour news cycle moves on, i won't. %$* 736
this is too important. %$* 736
this goes to the heart of who we are. %$* 736
this is about our character as americans. %$* 736
that's why we also need to fix the crisis of mass incarceration, eliminate the disparity in sentencing between crack and powder cocaine %$* 736
dismantle the school to prison pipeline that starts in school and diverts too many african-american kids out of school and into the criminal justice system, instead of giving them the education they deserve to have. %$* 736
and we need to do, all of us need to do, and i look forward to working with the naacp. %$* 736
we need to do a much better job helping people who have paid their debt to society find jobs and support when they get out. %$* 736
you know, america is well known, and we want to be a land of second chances. %$* 736
but so many americans never had a first chance to begin with. %$* 736
so, let's give everyone a fair chance at rebuilding their lives. %$* 736
as abraham lincoln said, give everyone a fair chance in the race of life. %$* 736
my plan would make significant investments in re-entry programs for those formally incarcerated. %$* 736
and i will ban the box in the federal government. %$* 736
people deserve a real shot at an interview, instead of being told no right out of the gate. %$* 736
and then beyond criminal justice, we must, we must fight for common-sense reforms to stop gun violence. %$* 736
you've been listening to hillary clinton speaking at the naacp convention in cincinnati, ohio, not far from where we are. %$* 142
we're just a little while away in cleveland. %$* 142
we're here inside the convention hall. %$* 142
we want to welcome our viewers in the united states and around the world. %$* 142
i'm wolf blitzer reporting. %$* 142
as this republican national convention kicks off today, the gavel will drop in just a few minutes to get all the action officially started. %$* 142
the theme for this first day of the convention is "make america safe again" and that includes the national security and immigration. %$* 142
several top republicans will speak on those issues throughout the day and into the evening. %$* 142
former texas governor rick perry among them, along with senators jeff sessions, tom cotton and joni ernst. %$* 142
also, former new york city mayor rudy giuliani, he will be speaking tonight. %$* 142
retired lieutenant general michael flynn, the former head of the defense intelligence agency, had been under consideration for the vice presidential slot. %$* 142
also speaking tonight is pat smith. %$* 142
she is the mother of shawn smith, one of four americans who were killed during that attack in benghazi, libya. %$* 142
two u.s. marine corps veterans who fought in the benghazi battle will also speak. %$* 142
but the headliner tonight will be melania trump, donald trump's wife and prospective first lady of the united states, if in fact, he is elected. %$* 142
donald trump certainly has pinned a lot of his hopes on her. %$* 142
and you see what's going on the floor. %$* 142
pretty soon we'll be seeing all of this unfold. %$* 142
it's an important moment right now. %$* 142
the gavel will be called to order. %$* 142
reince priebus, the chairman of the republican national committee, he will introduce that call to order. %$* 142
there will be a presentation of colors by the cuyahoga county veterans. %$* 142
that is the county here in cleveland. %$* 142
presentation of colors by the cuyahoga county veterans and then there will be the national anthem. %$* 142
there will be an invocation by rabbi ari wolf of cleveland. %$* 142
he's a police chaplain. %$* 142
colors will be retired. %$* 142
there'll be musical. %$* 142
people have gathered here. %$* 142
there will be a business session that will take place here on the floor of the republican national convention in cleveland. %$* 142
we have an extensive panel of guests, analysts, reporters who are with us here. %$* 142
we'll be covering all of this as we watch it unfold. %$* 142
david gregory, you're among the panel. %$* 142
this is an important moment, because it's officially going to be not only the republican national convention, but the trump national convention. %$* 142
his fingerprints are all over this agenda. %$* 142
all over this, because this is now donald trump's republican party. %$* 737
and if there are republicans around the country, official capacity or otherwise, they have to get right with that. %$* 737
and this is an opportunity for trump to do something he has not done up until now, which is really unify the party. %$* 737
that's a lot of witness convention is about. %$* 737

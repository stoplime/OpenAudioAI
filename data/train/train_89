thanks for joining us. %$* 308
i'm ed henry. %$* 308
president bush is getting ready to leave washington for his texas ranch, but first he's putting together an essay of sorts: "what i did before my summer vacation." %$* 308
the administration is eager to tout its year-to-date accomplishments, including the central american free trade agreement mr. bush signed today at the white house. %$* 308
and that's where we begin with our correspondent suzanne malveaux -- suzanne. %$* 308
well, ed, there's already a sense of excitement here at the white house that the president is going to be leaving for his crawford ranch in about 30 minutes or so. %$* 307
this is for his month-long recess, but of course, his calendar already filling up with activities. %$* 307
what we expect tomorrow in a speech is essentially what you said, an essay which is reflecting some of his legislative victories. %$* 307
he'll be talking about the energy bill, the highway bill. %$* 307
and of course, he'll also be talking about the central american free trade agreement or cafta. %$* 307
that is what he signed today. %$* 307
it was a particularly sweet victory for the president, really; the house passing it by just two votes. %$* 307
and he put a lot of political capital behind this. %$* 307
he had to convince republicans from states like north carolina, ohio, as well as pennsylvania -- those are the places where they felt they had the most to lose when it came to american jobs -- to sign on to this legislation. %$* 307
president bush making the case today, as he had for months. %$* 307
and, of course, a result of a lot of the deal-making that was going on on capitol hill, that this was more than a trade bill. %$* 307
all of us in this room understand that to keep our economy growing and creating jobs, we need to open markets for americans' products overseas. %$* 161
all of us understand that strengthening our economic ties with our democratic neighbors is vital to america's economic and national security interests. %$* 161
and all of us understand that by strengthening ties with democracies in our hemisphere, we are advancing the stability that comes from freedom. %$* 161
now, ed, his focus on national security has been much more successful when it comes to the focus on social security. %$* 307
that is one of the tasks that he's going to have when he's at crawford, to come up with a way to re-engage members of congress, when they come back from their recess, to focus on what he wants. %$* 307
and that is his social security reform agenda -- ed. %$* 307
suzanne, another thing the president has been doing on his way out of town is doing some interviews with small groups of reporters. %$* 308
and yesterday, he addressed the question of creationism versus evolution. %$* 308
and that is causing a little bit of controversy among some. %$* 308
others are saying there's nothing new here. %$* 308
what's the white house saying about that? %$* 308
well, ed, really, there is nothing new here. %$* 307
this is a point that the president has actually reiterated. %$* 307
and he talked about it back in the days when he was governor. %$* 307
it's very interesting. %$* 307
there's a statement that he made about it, saying, essentially, yesterday -- he says, i think part of education is to expose people to different schools of thought. %$* 307
essentially, to have those two schools of thought being taught side-by-side in this public school system. %$* 307
you take it back to the days when he was running for president the first term, he said something very similar. %$* 307
he said he believes that schools should be taught different forms of how the world was formed. %$* 307
essentially, white house officials, as well as education officials, saying, look, this is no indication of a new policy or even a federal position here. %$* 307
this is a local, this is a state issue, this is a curriculum issue. %$* 307
suzanne, also, the white house has been taking a lot of heat as you know, in recent weeks over the cia leak case. %$* 308
but in this interview yesterday, the president also seemed to give another vote of confidence to karl rove. %$* 308
does the white house think that they are kind of out of the woods on that? %$* 308
they're feeling a little better as he heads out of town for vacation? %$* 308
well, they're not completely confident they're out of the woods on this at all. %$* 307
as a matter of fact, the whole thinking behind this is that, yes, put a straight face forward here -- the president saying, karl's got my complete confidence. %$* 307
he's a valuable member of my team. %$* 307
make it very clear that that is the case. %$* 307
at the same time, there is some concern here of just how much this is going to overshadow the agenda going into the fall. %$* 307
they know they want to push forward on social security. %$* 307
they know that this, of course, is going to be somewhat of a distraction. %$* 307
they are hoping that in those months to come, the federal grand jury will wrap that up and hopefully this will go away. %$* 307
but they -- make no illusions. %$* 307
they have no kind of thinking that this is going to go away any time soon. %$* 307
ok. suzanne malveaux from the white house. %$* 308
thank you very much. %$* 308
the president and members of congress may need all the rest and relaxation they can get this month, because this fall, they're likely to be embroiled in one brawl after another. %$* 308
our congressional correspondent joe johns previews the fights ahead. %$* 308
barring any last minute surprises in the vetting process, the fight, if there is one, over john roberts' nomination to the supreme court, is expected to end before the court reconvenes october 3. %$* 360
after that, a minefield of sticky issues remain for the party controlling the congress. %$* 360
the republicans need to find some policy proposals that unite the party, rather than divide them. %$* 318
republicans can't agree among themselves on some of the toughest issues, including embryonic stem cell research. %$* 360
the senate majority leader gave it a push right before the august recess, but the white house and many congressional conservatives say it's a moral issue, and for them, bad politics. %$* 360
i think a candidate that believes in the destruction of life would have a very hard time appealing to the vast majority of the republicans in this party. %$* 510
democrats are instigating. %$* 360
it is my belief that we have set the stage to return in september and take up this important life- saving issue. %$* 561
another hot button topic, the president's social security plan. %$* 360
mr. bush is trying to keep it on life support, but some in his party fear a voter backlash on this issue, too. %$* 360
now's the time to act on this. %$* 161
now, i understand some in washington don't want to deal with the issue. %$* 161
it's too politically sensitive. %$* 161
and it doesn't stop there. %$* 360
on immigration reform and border security, on tax reform, getting agreements from here-on-out is not expected to be easy. %$* 360
the devil is always in the details, when have you a deficit, when you're talking about more tax cuts or permanent tax cuts. %$* 318
the republicans are going to have to figure out a way to do that without giving the democrats more ammunition. %$* 318
also, early in september, the senate is likely to take up something akin to permanent repeal of the estate tax, also known as the death tax. %$* 360
senate majority leader bill frist has said he would like to take that up pretty soon after getting back. %$* 360
ed, back to you. %$* 360
joe, we know republican leaders have been pushing to end the death tax for a long time now. %$* 308
also, at the beginning of the year, the president talked about structural tax reform. %$* 308
they seem to be having a hard time getting that done. %$* 308
what's been the roadblock there? %$* 308
well, differences of opinions, just like everything else. %$* 360
as you know, there are some members of congress who have said they want to see it done away with completely. %$* 360
there are others who say they think they ought to just scale it back a bit, rather than getting rid of the whole thing. %$* 360
and in the backdrop to all of this, as you know, this has also been used as a political issue. %$* 360
before it was used against tom daschle in his last senate race. %$* 360
he lost. %$* 360
some democrats apparently getting antsy, seeing ads about all of this from time to time. %$* 360
there's a little bit of worry here in the senate that this is an issue that needs to be addressed -- ed. %$* 360
ok. joe johns at the capitol. %$* 308
thank you, joe. %$* 308
another major league baseball player has been suspended for steroid use a day after the rafael palmeiro bombshell. %$* 308
up next, do members of congress who sat and listened to palmeiro's denials feel betrayed? %$* 308
i'll talk with two lawmakers with different takes on the steroid scandal. %$* 308
also ahead, a campaign for congress and against the president's iraq policy. %$* 308
will ohio voters send a message to the white house today? %$* 308
and later, summer snapshots of the president's agenda and what he can hope to accomplish in the long, cold months ahead. %$* 308
a day after slugger rafael palmeiro was suspended for testing positive for banned substances, another player has been suspended 10 days under baseball's new steroids policy. %$* 308
this time, it's seattle mariners pitcher ryan franklin. %$* 308
that news comes as lawmakers are questioning whether palmeiro was telling the truth when he testified before congress. %$* 308
palmeiro was adamant in his opposition to steroid use during his testimony last spring when he spoke in favor of a tough drug-testing policy for baseball. %$* 308
i'll be brief in my remarks today. %$* 494
let me start by telling you this: i have never used steroids. %$* 494
period. %$* 494
i do not know how to say it any more clearly than that: never. %$* 494
the reference to me in mr. canseco's book is absolutely false. %$* 494
yesterday palmeiro struck a much different tone. %$* 308
he acknowledged that he failed his own test, but he insisted he never intentionally took an illegal substance. %$* 308
why would i do this in a year where i went in front of congress? %$* 494
you know, why would i do this during a season where i was going to get the 3,000 hits. %$* 494
and i would not put my career on the line. %$* 494
i would not put my reputation on the line. %$* 494
i'm not a crazy person. %$* 494
i'm not stupid. %$* 494
earlier today, congressman jim moran of virginia, offered a tough assessment of palmeiro and questioned whether he misled congress. %$* 308
baseball is kind of an american institution and now its heroes, not only do they use steroids to enhance their abilities so it's an artificial skill they're really being paid to show us on the field, but more importantly, they lie under oath to a congressional committee. %$* 821
mr. palmeiro particularly, pointing his finger and so on and this guy's making millions and millions of dollars. %$* 821
and it's phony. %$* 821
it's not real. %$* 821
a short while ago, i spoke with a member of the house committee that hosted those baseball hearings back in march. %$* 308
democratic congressman elijah cummings of maryland was among those who questioned palmeiro, mark mcguire and others under oath. %$* 308
i started by asking congressman cummings if he thinks the committee should have pressed palmeiro and the others witness harder during their appearance on the hill. %$* 308
no, i think it would have been very -- as a lawyer, who practiced trial law, case law and for some 20 years, i can tell you it's kind of hard when somebody looks you in the eye and shakes his finger at you and says: no, i've never done this. %$* 680
i mean, what can you ask him? %$* 680
i mean, so -- think about it. %$* 680
right. %$* 308
but now that we have this test for major league baseball, saying that rafael palmeiro failed it, do you think now congress should refer this to a prosecutor and really press this and say he lied to congress under oath? %$* 308
to be frank with you, i think that would be very difficult to prove, because certainly mr. palmeiro would say that, you know, even if he did use steroids recently, that at the time of the hearing and before that he didn't. %$* 680
so, i think that's going to be hard. %$* 680
but congressman, do you think that maybe that would lead some skeptics to say, well, look, this congressional committee got all these headlines back in march, but it turns out they didn't really press the witnesses that hard and now, when one of them, it appears that he lied under oath to congress, you're probably not going to do anything about it? %$* 308
well, i can tell you, there will probably be some people on the committee that will press hard for it. %$* 680
i'm not going to be one. %$* 680
i think palmeiro has probably already suffered enough. %$* 680
here's a man that was at the mountaintop just a few weeks ago with having reached that major milestone. %$* 680
and now, he's at the bottom. %$* 680
and every time gets up to bat, he has got to wonder about his own self. %$* 680
he's got to wonder what his fellow players are thinking of him; what the fans are thinking of him; what those little children that have palmeiro written on the backs of their baseball shirts are thinking of him. %$* 680
and i think he's going to suffer enough. %$* 680
now, let me say this, though, as you know, the -- our committee passed out legislation where -- which said that if you are caught with using steroids the first time, you would have a two-year ban and then after that if you get caught again, it's lifetime. %$* 680
i still believe in that. %$* 680
so does congress then need to step in here? %$* 308
does there need -- %$* 308
no doubt about it. %$* 680
no doubt about it. %$* 680
i think that this case -- i think that what mr. palmeiro has done, is he has caused the congress, even if we weren't thinking about pressing real hard on this, to press very, very hard, because here we were, we had the poster-player of the league, one of our major players to come before us, look us in the eye, shake his finger at us and say, i didn't -- i have never used steroids. %$* 680
and then come to find out that he did. %$* 680
and keep in mind, this is not so much about palmeiro. %$* 680
this is not just about baseball. %$* 680
this is about our children. %$* 680
one in 45, 10 years ago, were using steroids. %$* 680
today one in 16 are using steroids and those numbers are going up. %$* 680
but what do you say to skeptics who say, well, wait a second. %$* 308
if baseball players are role models, then congress should all of a sudden step into a private enterprise and tell private enterprise what it should do? %$* 308
hollywood stars are role models. %$* 308
recording artists are role models. %$* 308
is congress now going to muck around and tell hollywood -- pass a law that says hollywood stars have to admit, you know and submit to a drug-testing policy? %$* 308
where do you draw the line, congressman? %$* 308
well, i think, clearly, we have to draw the line somewhere. %$* 680
but one thing is for sure. %$* 680
the line is not drawn at major league baseball. %$* 680
you've got a situation here where fans are paying big bucks to come and see these folks perform and they have a right, after scraping up the dollars that it cost -- i don't know whether you've recently been to a baseball game, but they are very expensive to get -- to bring your family to a baseball game. %$* 680
and you have the right to sit there and think and believe and know that your -- these people are playing on a level playing field. %$* 680
but let me tell you another thing. %$* 680
it basically creates as self- perpetuating fiasco. %$* 680
if one player is using steroids and making millions upon millions of dollars and there's another player who's making $300,000 not using steroids, then at some point, that player making that $300,000 is going to say, wait a minute, hold on here. %$* 680
maybe i need to be using steroids too. %$* 680
and the next thing you know, we'll have a whole league of folk who are injecting themselves with this illegal performance-enhancing substance. %$* 680
congressman, last question. %$* 308
i have 10 seconds. %$* 308
i know you're a big baltimore orioles fan, but do you think this means rafael palmeiro should be kept out of the hall of fame. %$* 308
yes or no? %$* 308
no -- i don't know. %$* 680
i think they should put an asterisk beside his name and say that he was caught using steroids, that's for sure. %$* 680
more on baseball, steroids and the role on congress next. %$* 308
should house members be concerned with the problems of professional athletes? %$* 308
not every member of congress thinks so. %$* 308
now, another take on the steroids and baseball scandal and whether congress should be involved in the crackdown. %$* 308
democratic congressman paul kanjorski suggests lawmakers have more important things to do. %$* 308
he joins us from his home state of pennsylvania. %$* 308
welcome, congressman. %$* 308
nice seeing you, ed. %$* 822
i wonder whether, now whether rafael palmeiro has failed this test and it appears that he could have lied to congress, whether you have any second thoughts about back in march, when you said you felt it was a waste of the committee's time; they should not have issued these subpoenas for palmeiro and mcgwire and others to testify. %$* 308
well, i think we're taking a very limited view of the use of steroids and other supplements in our society. %$* 822
that probably warrants a national debate. %$* 822
but i thought that we misused our subpoena power in congress in trying to set up some superstars and meddle in the standards set by the league. %$* 822
quite frankly, the fact that the league testing device picked up this abuse shows that it can be done in the private sector without congress and without us getting involved at a federal regulatory level. %$* 822
but do you think that at least congress should now refer this to a prosecutor and find out whether or not rafael palmeiro committed perjury? %$* 308
you now, as a lawyer, i think that would be very difficult. %$* 822
this occurred much after the fact when he testified. %$* 822
to my knowledge, there's no evidence of the existence of the steroid use at the time he was testifying. %$* 822
i don't know one way or another. %$* 822
but that's not -- we don't want to play a game of "got you," whether they're on baseball stars, hollywood celebrities, or just average people. %$* 822
what we want to do is get some ability to regulate things that have to be regulated and not regulate everything in life. %$* 822
and there's some choices and probably a national debate is necessary on the subject. %$* 822
but to run full ahead because we have one individual now, months after his testimony, that has been found to be positive, and we don't know why he's positive. %$* 822
but in baseball, it's strict. %$* 822
it's strict liability. %$* 822
if the test comes back positive, that's it. %$* 822
you don't get -- you don't test how you got it, where you got it from, what circumstances, did you have knowledge. %$* 822
that's un -- invaluable in terms of deciding. %$* 822
it's strict liability. %$* 822
you get caught with a positive test, you're out. %$* 822
that's what happened here. %$* 822
but now that this can of worms has been opened by the committee, do you think it should -- the committee should pursue this investigation further? %$* 308
not just on the perjury question, but also the committee, it appears, was almost a dupe in this. %$* 308
i mean, rafael palmeiro, at the end of that denial at that hearing was then made part of a task force created by the committee, some zero tolerance roundtable. %$* 308
and now it appears that he actually ended up using steroids. %$* 308
and the committee now might look a bit silly. %$* 308
what should the committee do to deal with it now? %$* 308
i really think the congress and the committee has huge issues that affect everyday lives of american people, far greater than the use of steroids. %$* 822
the use of steroids should be considered bad if it's detrimental to your health or the larger population health, but that can be handled and regulated most often in the private sector and not offered there at the state level. %$* 822
but i think, you know, it's time we start finding out why we're in iraq, where are the weapons of mass destruction, why do we have a $600 billion deficit every year, why is medicare going broke. %$* 822
we've got issues that impact on every american's lives, every day they live. %$* 822
and most americans aren't taking steroids. %$* 822
and if baseball players are taking very few, that can be handled within the league. %$* 822
and they're developing those standards. %$* 822
if they want to increase those standards to the olympic standards, i'm perfectly happy. %$* 822
whatever they decide on the outside. %$* 822
i would prefer congress not to meddle as much in private lives, in the private sector, as much as we are and attend to the business that are clearly defined for the congress to do. %$* 822
ok, congressman paul kanjorski, democrat of pennsylvania, thanks for joining us. %$* 308
thank you. %$* 822
it's election day in one ohio congressional district, and the iraq war is a big part of that political showdown. %$* 308
still ahead, the veteran fighting to go to the hill and the opposition he faces. %$* 308
and evolution, or intelligent design? %$* 308
do americans agree with president bush when it comes to creation and education? %$* 308
as the markets get set to close on wall street, i'm joined now by kitty pilgrim in new york with "the dobbs report" -- kitty. %$* 308
hi, ed. %$* 315
thanks a lot. %$* 315
very good day on wall street. %$* 315
let's start with the dow industrials. %$* 315
they're up about 59 points. %$* 315
nasdaq about 1 percent higher. %$* 315
and the auto sales are showing up in the economy. %$* 315
new figures show that personal incomes are up half a percent, spending up more, and much of that on cars. %$* 315
now, here's a great twist to that story. %$* 315
gm has changed its mind. %$* 315
today, it announced it's extending the employee discount program through labor day. %$* 315
this was supposed to end yesterday. %$* 315
ford and chrysler said they would keep their programs going. %$* 315
all three companies did great in july. %$* 315
ford had a 35 percent spike in sales. %$* 315
in other news, the battle over unocal has a new chapter. %$* 315
china's biggest oil company, cnooc, is dropping its bid, and that's because of political opposition here in the united states. %$* 315
now, critics of the deal said it would be a threat to national security to have china own a u.s. oil company. %$* 315
so now chevron can go through with its deal. %$* 315
00 eastern on lou dobbs tonight, taking on china's unfair trade practices. %$* 823
now some american executives and their employees are fighting back to save u.s. jobs. %$* 823
the old saying is, you don't go up to a gunfight with a knife, ok? %$* 824
well, right now, they've got more than a gun; they've got a house that's bearing down on us. %$* 824
also tonight, cnooc may have abandoned its attempt to take over unocal, but communist china is not giving up in its quest to acquire western assets. %$* 315
we'll have a special report on china's strategy. %$* 315
plus, should profiling be used to hunt terrorists in the united states? %$* 315
now, a noted scholar, author and investigative journalist, paul sperry tells us why he supports that tactic. %$* 315
00 eastern. %$* 750
be there -- lou dobbs tonight. %$* 750
but, for now, back to ed in washington -- ed. %$* 750
thanks, kitty. %$* 308
now back to inside politics and a final fight for a former marine. %$* 308
democrat paul hackett is vying to become the first iraq war veteran to serve in congress, a distinction that has put the national spotlight on ohio's 2nd district. %$* 308
voters there are casting ballots in a special election to replace congressman-turned-us trade representative rob portman. %$* 308
our bruce morton has more on the race and how it figures into the bigger political battlefield. %$* 308
hi, ma'am. %$* 496
how are you? %$* 496
paul hackett. %$* 496
paul hackett, ex-marine, democrat, running for congress in ohio's 2nd district, which has elected republicans to congress for more than 30 years and gave george bush 74 percent of its vote last november. %$* 321
if hackett wins, he would be the first iraq war veteran elected. %$* 321
three lost house elections in 2004. %$* 321
and iraq is what he talks about. %$* 321
he served seven months there in 2003, saw duty in fallujah, and thinks the united states isn't winning the peace. %$* 321
whoa, whoa, whoa, you told us a year-and-a-half ago mission accomplished. %$* 496
it's a hell of a lot worse there today. %$* 496
hackett opposed the invasion, but says the problem now is training iraqi forces to replace the americans. %$* 321
defeating the insurgency is a component of training the iraqi security forces. %$* 496
we are doing a miserable job as an administration, as a political administration, of supporting the troops on the ground and giving them the -- the leeway and the nuts and bolts to do that job. %$* 496
vietnam vet max cleland is among the democrats to campaign for hackett, an outspoken man who angered republicans by saying, i don't like the sob who lives in the white house, but i'd put my life on the line for him. %$* 321
still, this vietnam vet who voted for bush is having second thoughts. %$* 321
i think the plan, it's -- it's appearing to me that it's kind of make-it-up-as-we-go. %$* 825
and i don't know that that's a good plan for a military action. %$* 825
you know, i'm not a strategist. %$* 825
but jean schmidt, the republican candidate, thinks that's a minority view. %$* 321
the voters continue to believe in the president, believe in his message, and stand with him, as i do. %$* 502
i think the question that the american people want answered is, can we win this? %$* 496
and is our government being honest with us and being realistic on what it's going to take to win this? %$* 496
morton: hackett thinks the administration isn't doing what needs to be done in iraq. %$* 496
and, nationally, many americans agree. %$* 496
a recent cnn/"usa today"/gallup poll shows 53 percent think america won't win the war. %$* 496
but in ohio's very republican 2nd district, ex-marine paul hackett faces a steep uphill climb. %$* 496
bruce morton, cnn reporting. %$* 496
voters in detroit are also at the polls today to narrow a crowded field of candidates for mayor. %$* 308
incumbent kwame kilpatrick and former mayoral deputy freman hendrix are expected to lead the 12- person field and win the right to face off in november. %$* 308
kilpatrick's political fortunes have fallen in the past four years, driven down by a budget deficit and population decline. %$* 308
he has trailed hendrix in pre-election polls. %$* 308
from local politics to the big picture for both president bush and congress. %$* 308
let's talk about both with amy walter of the "cook political report" and ron brownstein of the "los angeles times." %$* 308
welcome to you both. %$* 308
ed. %$* 320
thanks, ed. %$* 162
president bush out to head out of town for a vacation, congress already gone, but not before they passed a slew of legislation, energy bill, the central american free trade agreement. %$* 308
good for the president? %$* 308
yes, overall, i think what we're seeing in the republican congress this year is, by historical standards, a remarkable ability to come together and pass tough bills. %$* 320
now, whether those bills are ultimately going to benefit them politically is another question. %$* 320
but if you look at this republican congress, unified control, and compare it to, say, the first two years of democrats holding both houses of congress with bill clinton, it is extraordinarily different. %$* 320
these republicans have been willing to cast votes that may be tough for them in their own districts in the interest of having the entire enterprise move forward by giving it a kind of a sense of accomplishment. %$* 320
as i said, the -- the risk for them is that the way they're doing that, the way they're holding their caucus together, is by passing bills that are very strong on the right. %$* 320
and that has had some, i think, contribution to the polarization of the electorate that we're seeing in polls about congress and president bush. %$* 320
amy, republican unity on the hill with the president. %$* 308
that's right. %$* 162
henry: but does that open the door for democrats to make the case that they're marching in lockstep -- they're going to be -- house and senate republicans will be on the ballot next year. %$* 162
the president will not be. %$* 162
absolutely. %$* 162
and, look, it's the case they've tried to make for the last couple of years, too, that this is a president whose popularity, especially right now, is at its lowest point. %$* 162
so, this may be a better time to use this argument than it was two years ago. %$* 162
i think ron is exactly right. %$* 162
what's -- what is pretty amazing is that, you know, for the last four years, this republican congress has been incredibly loyal to the president, really because they were trying to get this president reelected. %$* 162
we really thought, coming into these next four years, the focus was going to be on midterm elections, their own political safety, no longer the safety of this president. %$* 162
and they have given him some defeats, obviously, stem cell research being one of those. %$* 162
social security, they're not moving forward on the president's signature issue. %$* 162
but on some of these other bills, yes, they've shown a willingness to go forward. %$* 162
remember -- and this is important -- two- thirds of the members of congress have never been in the minority, republicans, have never been in the minority. %$* 162
so, they don't remember what it was like when democrats were back there in 1994. %$* 162
so, they haven't seen this kind of environment. %$* 162
on stem cells, the white house would say that the battle is not over yet. %$* 308
bill frist... %$* 308
very true. %$* 162
... may have come out against them. %$* 308
very true. %$* 162
but they still have to fight that out in september. %$* 308
no, look, there are inevitability going to be disagreements. %$* 320
but if you think about -- think about the last time we had unified control in washington, under bill clinton, '93, '94. %$* 320
conservative democrats would not vote for the crime bill. %$* 320
liberal democrats would not vote for nafta. %$* 320
what have we seen under republicans? %$* 320
we've seen conservatives vote to expand medicare prescription drugs in 2003, which they didn't really want to do. %$* 320
we've seen republicans really of all stripes give the votes they needed to pass the central american free trade agreement last week, which many of them didn't want to do. %$* 320
they are making votes that are tough in their own district, in the interest of creating a perception of success for the congress overall. %$* 320
but now, the -- the other side of this, i think, ed, is that, when you look at your last poll on president bush, his approval rating among republicans was still among 87 percent. %$* 320
they like the fact that republicans are sticking together. %$* 320
they are energizing the base with what they're doing. %$* 320
but some of these initiatives, whether it's terri schiavo or perhaps even the recess appointment of john bolton may be contributing to a 36 percent approval rating among independents, 17 among democrats. %$* 320
it is inherently polarizing, the strategy that they -- they have chosen to accept polarization as the price of accomplishment. %$* 320
polarization. %$* 308
tom delay, let me bring him up in this fight, because, on the schiavo case, he was out front, maybe too out front, some suggested. %$* 308
he pulled back for a while with ethics troubles, perhaps overshadowing the agenda for a while. %$* 308
but he was back strong on the central american free trade agreement, the energy bill. %$* 308
he was the one pushing it through. %$* 308
is he back? %$* 308
is this democratic idea that they would make ethics the big mantra in the next election over? %$* 308
i don't think it's over yet, because, certainly, we have not seen the continuing saga of jack abramoff, which i believe will still continue to be in the press, and the idea about one-party control, control of special interests in washington and their influence. %$* 162
but i think, in going back to what ron is saying, yes, it is a much more polarized congress, partly because of the way districts are drawn and the kind of people who are in these seats. %$* 162
it is very different from 1992, 1994, when you actually did have moderates. %$* 162
remember those people? %$* 162
they're not really around anymore. %$* 162
right. %$* 320
because those seats don't exist anymore. %$* 162
so, there are very -- it's a little bit in some ways easier even to keep a 15-seat majority than it was to keep a 40-something-seat majority, like it was in -- in the 1990s. %$* 162
what about this special -- special election race in ohio, where paul hackett has basically made not just the president, but his iraq war policy, the issue and, as a democrat, is doing better than expected in this race? %$* 308
right. %$* 320
what should we divine from that? %$* 308
well, it's a very republican district. %$* 320
i think it's going to be hard for him to do too well. %$* 320
i mean, democrats are saying, if he gets to 45, that's a sign of trouble. %$* 320
i think there's no question, when you look at what -- where the parties stand on public opinion, where the president stands on public opinion, that iraq is having a down -- is pushing downward pressure on the president's standing. %$* 320
now the question is, what does that translate into by the fall of 2006? %$* 320
do democrats need to have an alternative? %$* 320
there are some democrats who believe that, if the democrats are more forthright with an alternative, the debate would become their idea versus the president's. %$* 320
right now, it's a referendum up and down on how the president's policy is going. %$* 320
that's a big fundamental choice they face, strategic choice they face, before 2006. %$* 320
what about that? %$* 308
in the last cycle, democrats making a big deal about picking up seats in places like south dakota in house races, in red states? %$* 308
right. %$* 162
what about now, ohio? %$* 308
well, the ohio case, i think it's much more about -- going back to your point about tom delay and ethics, it's much more about that issue than it is almost anything else, even more so than iraq. %$* 162
and here's why. %$* 162
ohio is a state completely controlled by republicans, from the governor on down to the state legislature. %$* 162
there is a big scandal going on in the state involving the governor. %$* 162
the governor has approval ratings now down in 19, 17 percent. %$* 162
the real question is, will this drag down republicans on the rest of the ticket, even in a district as republican as this one? %$* 162
what democrats can hope is that, like ohio, washington is run by one party, and to make that an argument in the national elections next year, that you get one-party control, you get problems, absolute power, etcetera. %$* 162
and that's clearly the direction they're going. %$* 320
the narrative -- you asked about the ethics before. %$* 320
the narrative that republican -- the democrats are trying to spin for 2006 election, or pull together, is that republicans are delivering for their special interests in washington and not dealing with the problems of ordinary families, whether it's religious conservatives on terri schiavo or energy companies on the energy bill. %$* 320
there's a consistent argument they're trying to make that goes beyond individual ethics allegations to create a larger case. %$* 320
now, we're going to see if there are enough districts to make that -- to have much impact with that. %$* 320
but the fact is, republicans are looking at very low approval ratings for congress. %$* 320
they're putting a lot of hope in their belief that passing these kind of bread-and-butter bills, like the transportation bill and the energy bill, will begin to get those numbers up. %$* 320
but if those numbers don't begin to rise, if they're really being pulled down by anxiety about the economy and iraq, they will face some very difficult decisions next year, because no one wants to go into a midterm election with a 30 percent approval rating. %$* 320
sure. %$* 308
and are these that big of victories? %$* 308
i mean, the highway bill not actually that big to the average voter. %$* 308
that's right. %$* 162
but, also, the energy bill was watered down from where it started. %$* 308
what happened to social security and some... %$* 308
or -- or cafta. %$* 162
exactly. %$* 162
i mean, cafta is not an issue i think is going to move very much voters. %$* 162
we talked a little bit earlier about nafta. %$* 162
i think that was much volatile, much more in the public eye than this bill was. %$* 162
the highway bill certainly important because it has pork, which every member of congress loves to talk about come election time. %$* 162
but again, i think ron is right. %$* 162
if we're going into 2006 still talking about trouble in iraq, an economy that's struggling and high gas prices, passing this kind of legislation isn't going to make voters feel that much better. %$* 162
and, in some ways, cafta may be more of a sign of the trouble, the turbulent water, than of the success. %$* 320
it only squeaked through by two votes, really twisting arms. %$* 320
and it got over the top more by republicans making a case that we need to govern than arguing on the merits. %$* 320
and, in fact, you can look at cafta and the resistance to the cnooc acquisition of unocal, that was abandoned today, both as signs of resurfacing american concern about our ability to protect good jobs against foreign competition. %$* 320
that's a new element to our politics. %$* 320
let me just jump in. %$* 308
we have some live pictures of the president now at andrews air force base. %$* 308
he's about to head to texas for his summer break at his ranch in crawford, texas. %$* 308
we see him now there live heading towards air force one. %$* 308
and we want to come back. %$* 308
ron brownstein, amy walter, thank you so much to talk about. %$* 308
thank you. %$* 162
we appreciate you both coming in. %$* 308
there's an evolution under way in the schools. %$* 308
up next, president bush thinks students should get a scientific take on the origins of life, and a divine one. %$* 308
we'll look at the politics of intelligent design and public opinion about it. %$* 308
also ahead, judge john roberts and the latest document dump. %$* 308
are we learning any more about the man who would be a supreme court justice, or do americans know enough? %$* 308
and, when we go "inside the blogs," what do bloggers find so special about today's election in ohio? %$* 308
some political battles seem destined to be replayed over and over again. %$* 308
take the question of whether evolution or creation should be taught in the schools. %$* 308
president bush has weighed in on that subject once again, giving new life to the age-old debate. %$* 308
here's our senior political analyst bill schneider. %$* 308
the scopes trial took place 80 years ago, but the debate over evolution continues to rage. %$* 317
this week, president bush repeated a view he expressed in the 2000 presidential campaign. %$* 317
speaking to a group of reporters, the president said, i think that part of education is to expose people to different schools of thought. %$* 317
you're asking me whether or not people ought to be exposed to different ideas. %$* 317
the answer is yes. %$* 317
most americans don't have a problem with that. %$* 317
a "newsweek" poll taken last december asked people whether they favored teaching creation science in addition to evolution in the public schools. %$* 317
the answer, by better than 2-1, was yes. %$* 317
results like that drive many scientists crazy. %$* 317
they say efforts to dress up the biblical story of creation as a science -- it's now called intelligent design -- are really attempts to inject religion or politics into education. %$* 317
there are well established ways of making your argument, and these people are not using those methods. %$* 198
in march, the cnn/"usa today"/gallup poll asked americans if they would be upset if the theory of evolution was taught in the public schools. %$* 317
no problem, 63 percent said. %$* 317
what about the theory of creationism, defined as the idea that human beings were created by god in their present form and did not evolve from other species of animals? %$* 317
no problem, 76 percent said. %$* 317
most democrats, self-described liberals and people with postgraduate degrees don't object to the teaching of creationism. %$* 317
most americans want to be open-minded, teach different theories. %$* 317
scientists insist you refute a scientific theory with a better scientific theory, one that can be tested. %$* 317
let's not pretend that this has anything to do with science. %$* 198
but it has a lot to do with politics. %$* 317
many scientists feel that giving legitimacy to what they regard as a nonscientific theory has a cost. %$* 317
american students are tremendously disadvantaged if they don't understand the basic methods of scientific debate and research. %$* 198
calling it the theory of evolution creates a problem. %$* 317
it's just a theory, many people say. %$* 317
but everything in science is a theory. %$* 317
most scientists say intelligent design does not fit the definition of a scientific theory. %$* 317
and, bill, there's been an update from the midwest today. %$* 308
what's happening in kansas? %$* 308
well, in kansas, as you may recall, the state board of education adopted, or at least tentatively adopted, a set of standards that require a skeptical view of evolution being taught in the schools. %$* 317
well, today, their panel of educators that they appointed voted 16-3 that those standards have no scientific credibility. %$* 317
the state board will make a final decision before the end of this year. %$* 317
ok, bill schneider, our senior political analyst, thank you. %$* 308
sure. %$* 317
it's election day in ohio's 2nd district. %$* 308
up next, bloggers are weighing in on the upstart candidate who served in iraq and now wants to serve in congress. %$* 308
we'll check in with our blog reporters next. %$* 308
news about potential candidates for the white house leads off our tuesday "political bytes." %$* 308
indiana senator evan bayh is in iowa for the next several days. %$* 308
the democrat is making appearances around the state through thursday. %$* 308
also today, politicalmoneyline reports that, in the first half of this year, bayh's political action committee was the top fund-raiser among democrats believed to be considering a run for the white house. %$* 308
colorado congressman tom tancredo has raised his profile in the gop by focusing on the illegal immigration issue. %$* 308
tancredo is in south carolina, where he's scheduled to speak a few hours from now to the state fraternal order of police. %$* 308
he also has a new hampshire trip scheduled for september. %$* 308
democratic party chairman howard dean is also in the deep south. %$* 308
he's speaking to the annual convention of the southern christian leadership conference today in birmingham, alabama. %$* 308
and in arizona, another goldwater plans to try his hand at politics. %$* 308
don goldwater, the 50-year-old nephew of the late senator barry goldwater, announced today he's joining the field of republicans hoping to challenge incumbent democratic governor janet napolitano next year. %$* 308
and members of the blogosphere are weighing in on today's special election in ohio. %$* 308
let's check in with cnn political producer abbi tatton and jacki schechner, our blog reporter -- jacki. %$* 308
hi, ed. %$* 325
it is democrat paul hackett against republican jean schmidt in ohio's 2nd district today. %$* 325
and, if paul hackett wins, as we heard earlier on the show, he will be the first iraqi war veteran in congress. %$* 325
but what's even extraordinary about this in regard to the blogs is the role that they have played in getting hackett's name out there and especially in online fund-raising for hackett. %$* 325
we spoke to the hackett campaign in ohio. %$* 325
and they said -- this is a quote -- "the blogs have been crucial in the last few weeks." %$* 325
now, there have been a lot of blogs that have been on top of this specifically, swingstateproject.com being one of them. %$* 325
bob brigham and tim tagaris are actually in ohio at hackett headquarters right now. %$* 325
their blog is actually down at this moment, we're assuming from heavy traffic. %$* 325
another blog that has been on top of it has been blog.oh02.com. %$* 325
they say they were down for a little while. %$* 325
they are hoping that the chewing gums holds at this point, because big sites are linking to them and it keeps dropping them down. %$* 325
and hackett's powerful online fund-raising is being acknowledged, both sides of the aisle. %$* 384
over at redstate.org -- this is a conservative group site -- the founder, mike krempasky, he is blogging today and saying that this is a far-left candidate. %$* 384
but he is acknowledging that online donations for hackett have been extraordinary. %$* 384
and just to show you how that's been working, there's a site called actblue.com, a democratic grassroots site, which is trying to let people organize and get donations for the candidates of their choice, creating a page there. %$* 384
they have raised over $500,000 for this candidate. %$* 384
to put that in perspective, they had 150 candidates last year when they started up in june and, over the course of the elections last year, raised $850,000 for all 150. %$* 384
so, they're doing pretty well on this one. %$* 384
and to show you how it works, look at a blog yesterday. %$* 384
duncan black at atrios.blogspot.com put out this rallying cry, along with other bloggers, trying to raise $30,000 in get-out-the-vote funds yesterday. %$* 384
they put out the rallying cry. %$* 384
and you can click through here to the page to donate over at actblue. %$* 384
in eight hours, actblue tell us, they raised over $60,000 just through those blogs doing those kind of efforts. %$* 384
what is just as impressive as the money that is being raised online is the online activity, the grassroots, or netroots, activity, as it's called, that really is just getting hackett's name swirling around. %$* 325
hackett posted on dailykos.com, the top progressive blog, yesterday. %$* 325
and, essentially, what he was proposing is, if you send out two million e-mails, statistical, then 5,000 people in his district would get an e-mail from somebody they knew asking them to vote for paul hackett, sort of a six degrees of paul hackett viral e- mail campaign. %$* 325
another way that they've been using the blogs online is sites that were doing opposition research. %$* 325
the hackett campaign heard something on friday night that jean schmidt said that they didn't think was true. %$* 325
they got together with the blogs. %$* 325
they did a whole lot of digging on the internet and they found exactly what they were looking for. %$* 325
specifically, sterling newberry at bopnews.com found some documentation that proved their point. %$* 325
so, we will send it back to you, ed, but really extraordinary, what they're doing for the specific candidate in ohio. %$* 325
that's right, seeing it up close right in that race. %$* 308
thank you, jacki and abbi. %$* 308
the "strategy session" is straight ahead on inside politics. %$* 308
today, christian conservatives are all for it. %$* 308
many scientists are against it. %$* 308
we'll focus on the theory of intelligent design and tell you why president bush thinks it should be discussed in american schools -- that issue and some other big political topics when we return. %$* 308

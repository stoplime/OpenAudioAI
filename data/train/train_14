bill frist's big break: the senate majority leader parts with the president on stem cell research. %$* 116
i believe the president's policy should be modified. %$* 507
we'll put frist's about face and possible fall-out under the microscope. %$* 116
the president's choice for u.n. ambassador under fire again. %$* 116
it turns out john bolton was interviewed in the cia leak probe. %$* 116
so why didn't he tell senators? %$* 116
congress packs a massive transportation bill with goodies galore. %$* 508
a lot of boys dream about jessica simpson. %$* 509
congressmen dream about highway pork projects. %$* 509
and the race to '08 goes hollywood: but who should get top billing -- hillary clinton or john mccain? %$* 116
now live from washington, cnn's inside politics. %$* 116
thanks for joining us. %$* 360
i'm joe johns. %$* 360
senate majority leader bill frist may feel like he's in an alternate political universe today. %$* 360
the usually loyal white house ally put himself at odds with president bush over stem cell research. %$* 360
the surprise move is being praised by many democrats and blasted by some conservative republicans who could make or break frist's presidential prospects. %$* 360
our congressional correspondent ed henry has more on dr. frist's change of heart. %$* 360
following a white house signing ceremony, president bush sought out bill frist, after the majority leader's stunning decision to break with the white house on stem cell research. %$* 308
i believe the president's policy should be modified. %$* 507
we should expand federal funding. %$* 507
the republican leader threw his weight behind increased taxpayer financing of embryonic stem cell research, defying the president's veto threat. %$* 308
frist said as a physician, he believes loosening the president's restrictions could help cure diseases like alzheimer's and parkinson's. %$* 308
how we answer these questions today, and whether in the end we get them right, impacts the promise not only of current research, but of future research as well. %$* 507
it will define us as a civilized and ethical society forever in the eyes of history. %$* 507
leading conservatives blasted the move on moral grounds. %$* 308
i think a candidate that believes in the destruction of life would have a very hard time appealing to the vast majority of the republicans in this party. %$* 510
but it could play well with swing voters, especially after nancy reagan put out a statement saying frist's decision has -- quote -- "the potential to alleviate so much suffering." %$* 308
a moderate group known as stempac was just about to start running tv ads in the critical state of new hampshire, chiding frist for blocking the legislation. %$* 308
so why is senator bill frist holding up a bipartisan stem cell research bill? %$* 116
why is he preventing us from being the world's leader in stem cell research? %$* 116
frist aides insist that science, not politics, sparked the senator's decision. %$* 308
and he quickly won emotional praise from the bill's republican sponsor, arlen specter, who is battling cancer. %$* 308
the change is profound, because the majority leader, if you want to characterize it in terms of giving cover, has given cover to -- to the entire senate, given cover to the entire house of representatives. %$* 309
here is a man who really knows science and who really knows government. %$* 309
so it is a very, very profound change. %$* 309
it's an earthquake. %$* 309
but it's unclear whether frist's support will get specter to the magic number of 67 votes needed to override a presidential veto. %$* 308
what specter is hoping is that frist's intervention will cause the president to drop the veto threat and come up with a compromise -- joe. %$* 308
ed, shifting gears on you a little bit. %$* 360
there's some news on the timing of the supreme court hearing? %$* 360
almost. %$* 308
we actually were expecting a press conference last hour from senate judiciary chairman specter, who we were expecting was going to announce that in fact the hearings for judge roberts will start on september 6, right after labor day. %$* 308
that press conference was abruptly canceled. %$* 308
we now understand that some democrats, including chuck schumer, were objecting to other parts of the deal that would have demanded that in fact a committee vote would happen by september 15. %$* 308
democrats do not want to be boxed in on that just yet. %$* 308
but we're hearing that this is overall just a blip. %$* 308
they are going to work out the details they hope by the end of today before congress goes out of town for the recess. %$* 308
and the bottom line is, i ran into ed gillespie in the hallway a few minutes ago, one of the president's salesmen on the nomination. %$* 308
he said that regardless of what date it starts, they are ready to go -- joe. %$* 308
good enough, ed. %$* 360
i know you will be watching. %$* 360
thanks so much, ed henry. %$* 360
some democrats are taking fresh aim at another bush nominee for failing to fess up about a link to the cia leak saga. %$* 360
the state department acknowledged today that john bolton incorrectly told the senate foreign relations committee that he had not been interviewed as part of any investigation within the last five years. %$* 360
a spokesman says back in march, bolton did not recall his interview with the state department inspector general looking into alleged attempts by iraq to obtain uranium. %$* 360
one senate democrat, barbara boxer, is calling on mr. bush to pull bolton's stalled nomination. %$* 360
she wrote to the president, quote, "mr. bolton's feeble admission that he was in fact interviewed by the inspector general's office is simply too little too late, and does not recognize the gravity of giving false information to a senate committee which he swore was the truth." %$* 360
the white house doesn't seem likely to be swayed. %$* 360
two senior administration officials tell cnn the president may use a recess appointment to put bolton into the u.n. post early next week. %$* 360
that would likely enrage democrats who have blocked bolton's confirmation, arguing he does not have the temperament for the job. %$* 360
senate democrat chris dodd will weigh in on the bolton nomination and the problems later in the program. %$* 360
a wide-ranging energy bill. %$* 511
the senate gave final approval to the measure a day after the house gave its ok. now, senators are moving on to the next priority in the last minute rush before recess: a final vote on a $286 billion highway bill that cleared the house earlier today jam-packed with extras. %$* 511
it's supposed to be about highways, bridges and other transportation improvements, but the first highway bill expected to make it to the president's desk in years is loaded up with goodies for the folks back home -- goodies that make members of congress look like they are doing something on capitol hill. %$* 370
it's packed with pork for every congressional district in the nation. %$* 509
it's too expensive. %$* 509
and it really doesn't deal with the nation's transportation problems like congestion. %$* 509
the numbers are staggering. %$* 360
more than 6,300 projects, worth an estimated $24 billion, according to the watchdog group taxpayers for common sense. %$* 360
a $200 million bridge in alaska named for don young, the chairman of the house transportation committee. %$* 360
more than $16 million just for bike paths in the minnesota congressional district of the committee's top democrat jim oberstar. %$* 360
all told, oberstar's district will get more than $120 million for transportation projects, almost 10 times more than the average congressman. %$* 360
why? %$* 360
because i put in the most time, put in 31 years in the congress. %$* 512
the bill also funds horse trails, traffic lights and transit systems, even a day care center in illinois. %$* 360
many members of congress defend the bill as a creator of jobs. %$* 360
this legislation is a real shining example of using our transportation funds to make society better. %$* 512
experts say there may be other unexpected giveaways that won't be noticed until the bill becomes law. %$* 360
some conservative republicans on the hill are feeling betrayed today by the senate majority leader. %$* 360
up next, a staunch opponent of embryonic stem cell research responds to senator bill frist's latest speech on this controversial issue. %$* 360
i'll talk with senator sam brownback. %$* 360
plus, how does all this figure into the 2008 race for the white house? %$* 360
we're following the field and the latest plays. %$* 360
and later, house majority leader tom delay takes aim at frist's decision and the ethics question still dogging him. %$* 360
senate majority leader bill frist is certainly not alone in supporting an expansion of federal dollars for embryonic stem cell research. %$* 360
a cnn/"usa today"/gallup poll conducted in may found that a majority of americans supported easing restrictions on federal funding, or lifting them altogether. %$* 360
forty-three percent wanted to keep the restrictions in place or totally eliminate federal funding. %$* 360
the surprise move by senator frist is reigniting debate on the matter. %$* 360
democratic senator chris dodd, a supporter of stem cell research, will join me later. %$* 360
but with me right now is republican senator sam brownback. %$* 360
he's opposed -- and so opposed, in fact, to embryonic stem cell research, he once compared it to nazi experiments on prisoners. %$* 360
senator brownback, thanks for joining us. %$* 360
thanks. %$* 513
senator frist made it sound like this is consistent with his previous positions. %$* 360
do you agree with that? %$* 360
there is some consistency with it from four years ago. %$* 513
he articulated a similar position opposed to human cloning, but saying that we should be able to move forward with some embryonic stem cell research, which we have done. %$* 513
it is federally funded. %$* 513
it is moving forward today. %$* 513
now you have said before that you will do everything in your power to stop a bill on embryonic stem cell research like this. %$* 360
won't this certainly make it a lot harder for you? %$* 360
well, what we've articulated, and what we've negotiated, is a package of six votes, individual bills, back to back. %$* 513
and let's vote on the whole range of bioethical issues. %$* 513
and the reason that i said that is, i've been trying for four years to get a vote on human cloning, to ban human cloning and have been blocked. %$* 513
i said, so if we're going to vote on the embryonic stem cell, let's vote on human cloning as well. %$* 513
and with that package, i'm happy to move forward, have the debate. %$* 513
let's get a good vote and let's discuss how we're going to treat the human embryo, the young human in this society. %$* 513
we're going to treat it like property? %$* 513
or will we treat it like a person? %$* 513
are you upset with senator frist? %$* 360
and do you think this will affect his presidential aspirations if he moves forward on that? %$* 360
well, i'm disappointed. %$* 513
but he had articulated a similar position in the past. %$* 513
i don't know how it impacts any sort of presidential ambitions he might have. %$* 513
i do think it is important that we have this debate and vote on what do you think the young human embryo is. %$* 513
and that's why we put forward this package of votes that i think would be important to have and discuss with the american public. %$* 513
and speaking of presidential ambitions, it's been said that you might consider running for the white house yourself. %$* 360
what is the status of that? %$* 360
well, i'm looking at it. %$* 513
i'm traveling to some of the early primary states. %$* 513
no final decisions have been made. %$* 513
that is something that is yet to be seen. %$* 513
now, you met with judge roberts -- judge john roberts, who's been nominated now for the supreme court. %$* 360
tell me a little bit about that conversation. %$* 360
you've been quoted as saying -- you spoke to him a bit about the "book of wisdom" and the bible. %$* 360
and what was his response? %$* 360
well, we talked about a lot of things. %$* 513
we talked about our children. %$* 513
we both have young children. %$* 513
we talked about our view of the law and our view of the courts, which i found comforting. %$* 513
his discussion about the court as the umpire. %$* 513
and it's troubling when the umpire is the most watched person on the field, which is what's taking place today. %$* 513
people watch the court more than anybody else, and it should really be the one that says whether things are in bounds or out of bounds. %$* 513
but we had a good discussion. %$* 513
he's a brilliant man. %$* 513
i want to still see how he answers questions in committee before i decide how i'm going to vote on the nomination. %$* 513
now, that's what i also wanted to ask you about. %$* 360
you've said that you wanted to trust but verify on the judge. %$* 360
what is it that suggests you might not vote for him for the supreme court? %$* 360
i don't know that there's anything that would suggest that, other than that the paper trail behind him, the number of decisions that he has articulated, is thin. %$* 513
we don't know where he is on a number of various issues, and we're not going to know through this process, because that would call on him to pre-judge the case. %$* 513
but what i think we can know and should know is his view of the role of the courts in america today and the view of the constitution. %$* 513
is it a living document that kind of moves with the changing times? %$* 513
or is it a set text document that has to be amended to change? %$* 513
and i think those are things he can answer, should answer, and will help me in my decision-making. %$* 513
and i've got to ask you, is that a litmus test, the issue of how he views the constitution, in your view? %$* 360
well, i think it's an appropriate question for anybody to ask somebody that seeks to go on the supreme court and interpret the basic law document of the country, how do you view this document? %$* 513
i wouldn't consider it a litmus test, i'd consider it a very basic discussion about are we a rule of law, a nation that believes in the written text? %$* 513
or are we a rule of man, that, if any five people agree on it that sit on the supreme court, it changes? %$* 513
that's a very basic issue for us in this society. %$* 513
senator sam brownback, thanks so much. %$* 360
have a good break, and we'll see you in the fall. %$* 360
thanks, joe. %$* 513
you bet. %$* 360
could senator frist's presidential aspirations be the reason for his sudden switch on stem cell research? %$* 360
just ahead, "hotline" editor chuck todd will tell us all the rumblings on capitol hill and who else may be looking to run in '08. %$* 360
the current president and several wannabes in today's "political bytes." %$* 360
president bush's job approval rating has sunk to an all-time low in the gallup poll. %$* 360
it stands at 44 percent, down five points in the past week. %$* 360
senator joe biden is following the lead of some other potential presidential candidates by becoming an author. %$* 360
random house says the delaware democrat is writing a book that will tell the story of his, quote, "remarkable 30-year career in the united states senate." %$* 360
two authors/senators/presidential hopefuls have been mingling with the stars. %$* 360
democrat hillary clinton and republican john mccain attended last night's premier of the word war ii movie, "the great raid" before they took to the podium to speak. %$* 360
miramax chief harvey weinstein gave them a politically savvy introduction. %$* 360
ladies and gentlemen, i'd also like to introduce you to the first great 2008 bipartisan presidential ticket -- i'll let them figure out the order of that -- senator hillary clinton and senator john mccain. %$* 514
what a ticket that would be. %$* 360
maybe weinstein is hoping for the movie rights. %$* 360
senator frist's position on stem cell research could have a significant impact on the fate of the bill as well as frist's political future. %$* 360
joining me with some insight is chuck todd, the editor of the "hotline." %$* 360
chuck, thanks so much for coming in on another rainy friday. %$* 360
so, what does frist's announcement today mean for his potential political aspirations? %$* 360
actually, i think it helps position him a little bit better. %$* 381
you know, during the whole terri schiavo mess, it looked like he was getting the reputation as somebody that was going to pander and do whatever it took with social conservatives to be their candidate, be the main social conservative candidate in the republican primaries. %$* 381
now, in fact some of the rhetoric saying on stem cell research made it seem like -- this physician aspect is very important to bill frist. %$* 381
and if he had gone against the stem cell when basically every other major physicians' group was coming out for this thing, it would have put him at odds with his own biography. %$* 381
and his biography is more important to him than being a u.s. senator if he's going to be successful as a presidential candidate. %$* 381
so, i think it puts him in a better position to sell himself as physician, private citizen bill frist, rather than senator -- maybe panderer -- bill frist. %$* 381
and i think that may be a more comfortable place for him to run from. %$* 381
so, he wants to run as a doctor. %$* 360
he wants to run as a doctor, as a surgeon, as somebody who is unafraid -- who has to make tough decisions in life threatening -- you know, he wants to run as a surgeon, he doesn't want to run as a pandering republican politician. %$* 381
and i think that today he took a step back into the physician direction. %$* 381
now, he's out in 2006. %$* 360
and a bunch of other people who have been talking about running for the white house are also out in 2006. %$* 360
what's the strategy? %$* 360
well, it's interesting. %$* 381
and in fact bill frist was the first one, he announced very early that he wasn't going to run in '06. %$* 381
and everybody said, well, because he wants to run full time for president in '08. %$* 381
everybody saw howard dean was the only full time presidential candidate for a long time -- didn't have a day job, one of those pesky u.s. senate jobs to worry about. %$* 381
and he was able to make a lot more inroads because he was full time. %$* 381
the successful candidates -- ronald reagan was unemployed when he ran. %$* 381
and so now george pataki is following that route. %$* 381
mitt romney, the governor of massachusetts is expected to go that route. %$* 381
we're supposed to hear something from him in the next month or some. %$* 381
tom vilsack of iowa has taken that route. %$* 381
and then you have got mark warner who some people would like him to run in 2006 against george allen. %$* 381
and he's worried about being distracted and worried about not having a full time -- and wanting to be unemployed while running for president. %$* 381
and they'd also have a problem if they ran for reelection and lost. %$* 360
then, it would really shoot them down. %$* 360
well, that's what is interesting about all these guys is they're all -- other frist, frist would have been a shoo-in. %$* 381
every other guy is pulling out of a race that they may have had a better chance of losing than winning. %$* 381
pataki was already double digits behind in the polls in new york. %$* 381
romney is behind -- has never been ahead in a match-up against his likely democratic candidate in '06. %$* 381
vilsack would have been up against a very tough reelection fight winning a third term there. %$* 381
so and, of course, warner versus george allen in virginia would be no cakewalk for either one of them. %$* 381
so, it is -- it's the path of least resistance, that's for sure. %$* 381
one person we haven't talked about much is sam brownback, because we just had him on. %$* 360
does it look good for him, at least primary-wise? %$* 360
this is a big boon in this way -- first of all, geographically he's ideally situated just south of iowa. %$* 381
and the iowa caucuses are very -- the republican electorate is -- very much leans to the social conservative side of the party, not the economic conservative side, a la new hampshire. %$* 381
without -- now with less people coming on stem cell, it will be interesting to see, for instance, george allen's vote on this bill when it comes to the u.s. senate. %$* 381
but suddenly brownback's the lone, sort of true blue social conservative. %$* 381
he could be in great shape in iowa. %$* 381
this could be a big -- this could be a big thing him in iowa now that frist is sort of out of this camp. %$* 381
all right. %$* 360
thanks so much, chuck todd. %$* 360
we're looking forward to it. %$* 360
the "hotline," an insider's political briefing is produced daily by "the national journal." %$* 360
go online to nationaljournal.com for subscription information. %$* 360
while some republicans are chaffing about the bill frist stem cell reversal. %$* 360
is president bush angry that his man in the senate has broken ranks? %$* 360
we'll get a live report form the white house. %$* 360
plus, after weeks in limbo, john bolton's nomination to the u.n. is back in the news. %$* 360
and he is back under fire. %$* 360
a top democrat vents about bolton ahead. %$* 360
as the markets get set to close on wall street, i'm joined by christine romans in new york with "the dobbs report." %$* 360
-- christine. %$* 360
coming up on cnn at 6:00 pm eastern on lou dobbs tonight, china is seeking trading relationships with some of the world's most dangerous countries in its quest for oil to fuel its booming economy. %$* 369
and those alliances could threaten u.s. security. %$* 369
the chinese are able to go to these countries and essentially say, look, you know, we're not going hassle you about human rights, we're not going to hassle you about democracy or about your religion. %$* 515
all we want to do is buy your products and be friends. %$* 515
also tonight, the government is considering tightening restrictions on technology exports to china, technology that could be used to beef up its military. %$* 369
but big business doesn't like it. %$* 369
we'll have a special report. %$* 369
00 eastern for lou dobbs tonight. %$* 316
joe, back to you. %$* 316
thanks, christine. %$* 360
now, an update on cnn's top story today. %$* 360
sources close to the london terror investigation say all four men suspected of planting failed bombs on the city's transit system last week are now in custody. %$* 360
three were arrested in london, one in rome. %$* 360
images captured on closed circuit tv cameras helped lead investigators to the suspects. %$* 360
nabbed during dramatic raids in both the british and italian capitals, police with assault rifles and gas masks stormed apartment buildings the west london area, hunting for the suspected bombers. %$* 360
now, back to inside politics and today's stunning announcement by senate majority leader bill frist. %$* 360
the surgeon-turned-senator says he now plans to support legislation that would expand federal funding for embryonic stem cell research -- legislation president bush has threatened to veto. %$* 360
frist's reversal could have a significant effect on the fate of the bill which has passed the house but stalled in the senate. %$* 360
if we can answer the moral and ethical questions about stem cell research, i believe we will have the opportunity to save many lives and make countless others' lives more fulfilling. %$* 507
that's why we must get our stem cell policy right, scientifically and ethically. %$* 507
now let's get the white house reaction to frist's break with mr. bush from cnn's suzanne malveaux -- suzanne. %$* 360
well joe, actually the white house is trying its best to put on its best face over senator frist's about-face on the stem cell issue. %$* 307
we saw the two here at the white house earlier at a bill-signing ceremony. %$* 307
it was quite clear that the two of them walking together, that this happened just after frist made his announcement that he opposed mr. bush's limits on federal funding for embryonic stem cell research. %$* 307
now, an aide said that frist called the president last night not to blindside him with the news. %$* 307
at the white house, mr. bush making a point to call the senator over for a quick chat. %$* 307
aides are telling us the discussions between these two over the matter have been without hostility or irritation, the president telling frist last night, you have to vote your conscience. %$* 307
but frist's reversal, of course, could have a huge impact on the stem cell debate. %$* 307
the white house today tried to downplay that impact and they also, of course, reiterated the president's point of view. %$* 307
the decision that the president made was addressing taxpayer dollars. %$* 314
the president does not believe we should be using taxpayer dollars for -- or to support the further destruction of human life. %$* 314
that's where he set the line. %$* 314
now, there's no prohibition on the private sector research that goes on. %$* 314
now, political analysts say that because of frist's position here, the reversal, it could undermine the president, making this perhaps a veto-proof bill if it passes in the senate. %$* 307
also, of course, we saw, joe, quite a bit of frustration at the press office. %$* 307
it was in the press office today they were trying to emphasize, to focus on the string of legislative successes that the president has had just over the last 24 hours. %$* 307
they were not able to get the kind of traction they had hoped on those issues. %$* 307
instead, the focus very much being about this debate -- joe. %$* 307
so suzanne, i do expect there would be a little bit of concern there about the potential for the republican president of the united states in a veto showdown with the republican-controlled congress over an issue such as this. %$* 360
well, absolutely, because with frist's position, you could have perhaps six or seven or even more republican senators deciding they are going to go on his side. %$* 307
if you have a veto-proof bill, then the president, no matter how much he jumps up and down and threatens to veto this, you do have a showdown and perhaps it makes the president look somewhat weaker in his position. %$* 307
all right. %$* 360
great. %$* 360
thanks so much, suzanne malveaux. %$* 360
have a good weekend. %$* 360
thanks. %$* 307
you too, joe. %$* 307
two top republicans now are on opposite sides of the stem cell research debate. %$* 360
coming up, house majority leader tom delay offers harsh criticism of bill frist's break with the white house policy and conservatives. %$* 360
and, when we go "inside the blogs", online outrage as the london terror investigation presses on. %$* 360
now, a new twist on an old fight. %$* 360
some democrats are urging president bush to pull his nomination of john bolton to be ambassador to the united nations. %$* 360
as we told you earlier, the state department now says bolton was interviewed by a department inspector looking into allegations that iraq was trying to buy nuclear materials. %$* 360
in a questionnaire, bolton told the senate foreign relations committee had he not been interviewed in any investigation during the past five years. %$* 360
joining us now, a top democrat on the senate foreign relations committee, senator christopher dodd. %$* 360
thank you so much for coming in, senator dodd. %$* 360
thank you, joe, very much. %$* 516
the question i was asking you on the break, what do you make of this? %$* 360
do you think he just messed up? %$* 360
that's a possibility. %$* 516
but it's a little -- it stretches, you know, one's belief here. %$* 516
i mean, this was not an interview that occurred years ago, it happened just a few months before the application was filled out. %$* 516
and to just forget about an interview conducted by the inspector general on an issue that was so much in the news and that is, of course, as you point out the issue of weapons of mass destruction coming out of niger, the fact that he said no, this never occurred is very, very troublesome. %$* 516
and it ought to be a warning to the white house here for those who are thinking about a recess appointment, what other problems are hanging out there that we haven't determined yet with mr. bolton? %$* 516
the white house has too big an agenda at the united nations to put that agenda at risk by sending someone up who just can't be candid even in the application for a nomination as important as the united nations. %$* 516
now, is there anything democrats could do, of course, if the president did decide to make a recess appointment? %$* 360
no. %$* 516
that's a power that exists in the constitution to the president to exercise. %$* 516
presidents have been cautious about it. %$* 516
usually, it is used under difficult circumstances. %$* 516
remember, at the founding of the republic, we would leave town. %$* 516
it would be months sometimes before we got back. %$* 516
it's been abused more recently by both democrats and republicans who when they can't get a nominee through, wait for a limited recess and then slide someone in. %$* 516
that's not what the founders ever intended with recess appointments, but both democrats and republicans have used that vehicle in the past. %$* 516
i wish they wouldn't do it here. %$* 516
i think the job is too important. %$* 516
a recess appointment to some lower-level position i think most of us accept at some point, but not to the united nations. %$* 516
that's too big of a job. %$* 516
if the president were to do that, do you think it would have any effect on the political atmosphere on capitol hill with this supreme court nomination coming down the pike? %$* 360
i don't think so. %$* 516
i think these matters are dealt with sort of separately here. %$* 516
the problem is going to be whether or not the president is going to be able to have an effective agenda at the u.n., a reform agenda, which is so very important. %$* 516
we have huge issues emerging with north korea and iran; obviously, the problems in iraq and afghanistan, just to mention a few, are going to be before the united nations. %$* 516
you have a major meeting coming up in september with leaders from all over the world coming together. %$* 516
do you really want someone there representing your interests at the white house who's gone through as much difficulty here as john bolton has in the senate? %$* 516
and last but not least, what do you think about senator frist's decision today on stem cell research? %$* 360
well, i welcome it and i thank him for it. %$* 516
it's a -- the problem is, we still have opposition from the president and too many people in the senate. %$* 516
i had hoped, frankly, we would have been able to bring up the stem cell research bill before we left for the august break. %$* 516
the irony is we brought up a piece of legislation that allows gun manufacturers to avoid any legal liability, even when they are grossly negligent today, but we put aside a stem cell research bill that could save lives of those with alzheimer's, parkinson's, other such terrible ailments. %$* 516
we now know that this stem cell bill could make a huge difference in people's lives. %$* 516
unfortunately, senator frist didn't endorse the concept earlier. %$* 516
had he done so, we might have had this bill up. %$* 516
thanks so much, senator chris dodd. %$* 360
thank you very much, joe. %$* 516
senator frist is taking heat from some republicans today for endorsing embryonic stem cell research. %$* 360
among them is frist's house counterpart, majority leader tom delay. %$* 360
earlier, i spoke with congressman delay and began by asking him his thoughts on stem cell research and senator frist's change of heart. %$* 360
the majority leader of the senate changed his position; expressed that today. %$* 510
it's very disappointing. %$* 510
i have a strong disagreement with his position and will fight as hard as i can to defeat this bill. %$* 510
now, the house stem cell bill that passed over your objection -- there's obviously a question now as to whether, if it comes to that, there is a veto-proof majority in the house of representatives. %$* 360
that is correct. %$* 510
what's your view on that? %$* 360
why, we're going to hold that veto-proof majority. %$* 510
the president has taken the right position on destructive embryo stem cell research. %$* 510
we will support his veto of this bill and hopefully we'll -- the senate will take up the cord blood bill that spends millions of dollars on stem cell research gotten from cord blood, which has proven to already be curing diseases. %$* 510
embryonic stem cells hasn't proved a thing. %$* 510
mr. delay, on the energy bill, the house also passed that after years of controversy. %$* 360
there is a $1.5 billion provision in the bill for the texas energy center, which happens to be in your district. %$* 360
so, a lot of people obviously -- particularly the democrats -- are asking, how can you justify that kind of money to the oil industry when they seem to be doing pretty well already. %$* 360
first of all, your premise is wrong, joe. %$* 510
it's not $1.5 billion for texas energy center in my district. %$* 510
it's $1.5 billion of research for -- to produce more oil in ultra-deep parts of the gulf of mexico and ultra-deep land exploration. %$* 510
the oil across the country, consortiums, universities -- we have a particular consortium that will be competing for these grants. %$* 510
they will not get all $1.5 billion of it. %$* 510
this money is tied to the department of energy. %$* 510
they will give out the grants to those consortiums that prove that they can do the research. %$* 510
on cafta, a two-vote win. %$* 360
very close. %$* 360
a big win, obviously, for you, for the president, as well. %$* 360
of course, congressman charlie taylor of north carolina says his no vote wasn't counted. %$* 360
democrats are also asking some questions about whether there were any hijinks. %$* 360
what's your view on that? %$* 360
it was a straightforward bill and it was a tough bill to pass. %$* 510
we had to do a lot of educating of our members. %$* 510
we worked very hard with them. %$* 510
we didn't threaten them like the democrats threatened their members. %$* 510
we work with our members. %$* 510
we try to educate them and they came along and we passed it by two votes. %$* 510
charlie taylor's vote wouldn't have made a difference. %$* 510
now, the ethics committee, obviously an issue for you right now. %$* 360
there's been a lot of talk, as well, that you've been preparing information to turn over to them, particularly about your foreign travel, which could be the target of an investigation by the ethics committee. %$* 360
have you turned over that information? %$* 360
have you talked at all to the ethics committee? %$* 360
what's the status? %$* 360
well, the status is over 200 members have broken the house rules by not disclosing their trips, have not -- some members have had trips paid for by lobbyists and foreign agents. %$* 510
none of the trips that i have taken qualifies for that category. %$* 510
we fully disclosed my trips. %$* 510
we took no trips paid for by lobbyists as dictated by the house rules. %$* 510
we have put all that together and we'll give it to the rules committee -- i mean the ethics committee. %$* 510
and the ethics committee will look at all these trips. %$* 510
the only people that i know of that have actually broken the house rules are the leadership of the democrats and the trips they took and the lack of disclosure. %$* 510
on politics, obviously, you have the midterm elections coming up next year. %$* 360
a recent "usa today"/cnn/gallup poll said that just 46 percent of the respondents had a favorable opinion of the republican party. %$* 360
are you concerned that the public's turning against you? %$* 360
not at all. %$* 510
forty-six percent is a very good number. %$* 510
i -- if you compare it to back when we took the majority in 1994, we were hovering around 45 percent and yet we won seats all over the country; 73 of them, to be exact, and took the majority. %$* 510
forty-six percent is a very good number. %$* 510
just ahead, bill schneider will be here with the "political play of the week" and we'll check in with our blog reporters on what people are saying about john bolton, the still- controversial nominee to the u.n. ambassador post. %$* 360
an influential senator ignites a political firestorm over stem cell research. %$* 360
with us now and more on that, senior political analyst bill schneider. %$* 360
thanks for coming in. %$* 360
joe, it's not every day that a majority leader breaks with his party's president on a major issue, especially a majority leader who may have bigger ambitions. %$* 317
is that political suicide or is it the "political play of the week"? %$* 317
: four years ago, bill frist endorsed federal funding of embryonic stem cell research. %$* 317
he said he favored restricting the research to a limited number of cell lines, adding -- this does not mean limiting it to research using stem cells that have already been derived to date. %$* 317
two weeks later, president bush announced the policy to do just that. %$* 317
i have concluded that we should allow federal funds to be used for research on these existing stem cell lines. %$* 161
frist said he supported the president's policy. %$* 317
now the senate is considering a bill to lift some of the president's restrictions. %$* 317
i believe the president's policy should be modified. %$* 507
his justification? %$* 317
in 2001, president bush said more than 60 embryonic stem cell lines would be available. %$* 317
this has proven not to be the case. %$* 507
today, only 22 lines are eligible. %$* 507
frist claims he's sticking with his principles. %$* 317
frist: that is what i said four years ago, and that's what i believe in today. %$* 317
frist's speech drew immediate criticism from anti- abortion conservatives. %$* 317
senator frist is a good man. %$* 510
he is simply advocating a bad policy. %$* 510
in may, a cnn/"usa today"/gallup poll asked americans whether they favored fewer government restrictions on the stem cell research. %$* 317
a small majority said yes, but among republicans, most said no, current restrictions should be kept. %$* 317
senator frist is taking a gamble. %$* 317
he spoke with president bush on thursday before his speech. %$* 317
and the two of them looked pretty friendly on friday after he spoke. %$* 317
but if the bill passes and president bush makes it his first veto, the issue will acquire symbolic significance to conservatives who tend to dominate republican primaries. %$* 317
you have to balance that against the impact of having nancy reagan issue a statement that says -- "thank you, dr. frist, for standing up for america's patients." %$* 317
senator frist says he is trying to strike a balance. %$* 317
to me, it isn't just a matter of faith. %$* 507
it's a matter of science. %$* 507
and politics -- gaining him the "political play of the week". %$* 317
: striking a balance can make you seem fair-minded and independent -- as long as you can keep your balance. %$* 317
is this a flip-flop? %$* 360
well, he sort of flip-flop flipped. %$* 317
he took a position in july of 2001, which is very much like what he's doing now. %$* 317
then when the president differed from that position, he said he supported the president. %$* 317
now he's going back to his original position. %$* 317
so when did he flip? %$* 317
you could say maybe not now but when he supported the president. %$* 317
bill, schneider, thanks so much. %$* 360
the president's controversial pick for the u.n. ambassador post, and a blogger who's in some hot water with the white house are creating quite a buzz in the blogosphere. %$* 360
we check in now with cnn political producer abbi tatton and jacki schechner, our blog reporter. %$* 360
jacki? %$* 360
hi, joe. %$* 325
we should point out, not in hot water, but did get a phone call. %$* 325
we'll talk about that in just a moment. %$* 325
but first, the blogs are talking about john bolton and whether or not he incorrectly answered a question on a senate foreign relations committee questionnaire. %$* 325
they've been talking about that all week. %$* 325
it turns out now the state department had said yes, that bolton had forgotten that he did give some testimony to an inspector general, and that was part of an investigation that they were looking into, having to do with did iraq purchase uranium from niger. %$* 325
so the washington note has been the blog to go to on this -- washingtonnote.com. %$* 325
this is run by steve clemons. %$* 325
he has been all things bolton since all of this started -- figures he would go on vacation for two weeks when all of this broke. %$* 325
but he does have some wonderful guest bloggers who are doing a very good job of picking up the pieces in his absence. %$* 325
and today they are reporting on the latest developments. %$* 325
this is dave meyer, saying that the white house continuing to stand behind their nominee, even though there was this lapse on the questionnaire. %$* 325
and there was talk of a recess appointment for this nominee a few weeks ago. %$* 384
that's resurfacing today. %$* 384
when we discussed that a few weeks ago, we noticed that a lot of the conservative bloggers did not think this was a good idea. %$* 384
a recess appointment would send the wrong message to the world. %$* 384
that's being said again today, but we're also finding conservative bloggers who are going one step further and saying perhaps it's time for a withdrawal of this nominee. %$* 384
we heard it from senator barbara boxer, a democrat saying that -- she's being joined by some of the conservative bloggers. %$* 384
dr. stephen taylor  saying that this nominee is sufficiently wounded and it's time to withdraw, agreeing with james joyner at outsidethebeltwayinvirginia who is just saying that his character and judgment have been called into question on a repeated basis -- this is not the nominee to go with. %$* 384
whether the white house listens to these bloggers remains to be seen. %$* 384
we do know the white house now is reading at least one blog -- that would be americablog.com. %$* 325
john aravosis over there got a phone call from the white house communications office yesterday. %$* 325
they wanted to clarify that president bush did not give an obscene gesture to reporters. %$* 325
he was giving a thumbs up in regard to cafta. %$* 325
one, reaching out to bloggers; and two, reaching out to bloggers on the other side of the aisle. %$* 467
he says that is a very good work on the part of a smart pr person. %$* 467
over to london now. %$* 384
we talked a lot a couple of weeks ago in the last month about the eyewitness accounts that were coming out on blogs, the photos that were coming out on blogs during the explosions in the last few weeks and the attempted explosions on mass transit. %$* 384
today, with the extensive terror raids going on, bloggers are also contributing to the story. %$* 384
this one, at myalteregoliquid.play.com  was disturbed to see policemen in his backyard in the tavistock road area of london. %$* 384
as it went on, he realized that one of the arrests was actually made in the flat next door to him, distinct unease going on there in london. %$* 384
a tremendous amount of dis-ease , or unease. %$* 325
over at mattt -- this is matthewturner.co.uk also in the same neighborhood. %$* 325
and he says -- and we can't figure out if he's being kind of snarky -- but he essentially says it feels like everybody's under attack, and as he heard about these raids, he wasn't sure what was going on, and if he were a jittery american banker, he says he would move out and fast. %$* 325
joe, we'll send it back to you. %$* 325
thanks, guys. %$* 360
the "strategy session" is straight ahead on inside politics. %$* 360
today, senate majority leader bill frist risks a rift and takes a stand on stem cell research. %$* 360
it's not what president bush wants to hear. %$* 360
welcome back to inside politics and our strategy session on today's hottest political topics. %$* 360
with us today, democratic strategist and cnn political analyst paul begala, and bay buchanan, president of the american cause. %$* 360
the frist-bush split. %$* 517
senate majority leader bill frist breaks with the white house over stem cell research. %$* 517
the ongoing bolton battle -- new concerns raised about u.n. %$* 517
ambassador nominee john bolton, even as the white house looks at ways to get around confirmation. %$* 517
'08 aspirations. %$* 517
three years to go, but possible presidential candidates are getting an early start. %$* 517
who will rise to the top of the heap? %$* 517
first, to bill frist. %$* 517
the senate majority leader threw political expediency to the wind today and reversed his position on federal support for stem cell research placing him and president bush on opposite sides of the issue. %$* 517
frist went on the record this morning. %$* 517
i believe the president's policy should be modified. %$* 507
we should expand federal funding and the accompanying nih oversight and current guidelines governing stem cell research, carefully and thoughtfully staying within ethical bounds. %$* 507
a cnn/"usa today"/gallup poll, may 20-22nd: fewer restrictions on government funding of stem cell research. %$* 360
now, you guys, you can see the polls. %$* 360
you know the deal. %$* 360
what does this tell you about bill frist? %$* 360
bay buchanan, cnn contributor and president of american cause: well, clearly, it's -- he's taking a position against this president and so you have to ask why? %$* 360
why would he do this? %$* 360
he's also taking a position that will hurt him if he should choose to run for president in '08. %$* 360
and so again, so why would he do this? %$* 360
i have spoken to several senators and i do know that over the past couple of months, there's enormous pressure from the pharmaceutical companies to get this federal funding that they feel that they're at a disadvantage with other corporations around the world and they want it. %$* 360
they want it badly and they've been pushing hard. %$* 360
those are their people that fund their campaigns. %$* 360
now, let's just go back to that poll one more time. %$* 360
a cnn/"usa today"/gallup poll clearly indicates 53 percent to 43 percent people favor fewer restrictions on government funding of stem cell research. %$* 360
paul begala, is he sort of moving to the middle on an issue like this? %$* 360
well, he's certainly trying to. %$* 506
one of my rules in politics is that flip-flops very rarely work. %$* 506
as bill schneider pointed out early, this is a flip-flop flip. %$* 506
now, this guy's claim to credibility is his renown as a physician and it is beyond question. %$* 506
so, he ought to have had a clear position on this. %$* 506
he's had three positions in five years. %$* 506
exactly. %$* 422
i think bay's right about the strategy here. %$* 506
it appears to be -- i hate to question somebody's motives, but it appears to be more of a political move than a move of great principle. %$* 506
and even the 53 percent who now he would hope would be pleased, i suspect they're going to think that it was just for politics anyway and i don't that think it helps him with that 53. %$* 506
i think they think: well, he just did that for political expedience. %$* 506
and the point here, joe, is also, when you look at these polls, this is not a voting issue. %$* 422
you don't go into a senate race and say, gosh, we're on the position -- the party is in the wrong position on stem cells. %$* 422
i mean, we've got problems with jobs and immigration, social security out there, health care. %$* 422
these are hot issues that you can worry about. %$* 422
this is not one of those. %$* 422
so, then again, why would he do this? %$* 422
i, again, believe that it's the corporate pressure. %$* 422
they want this money. %$* 422
they want to make certain they're taking care of those guys who are taking care of them. %$* 422
but this... %$* 360
the other end of the spectrum -- sorry to interrupt -- and that is, he's breaking with the president. %$* 506
this is a trend. %$* 506
in the president's first term, the republicans were lockstep behind him. %$* 506
they were very loyal. %$* 506
now have you walter jones, a conservative republican congressman from camp lejeune, breaking with the president on the war. %$* 506
senator hagel, others breaking with the president on social security. %$* 506
thirty- nine i think i counted -- 39 republicans broke with the president the other day on his free trade bill for central america. %$* 506
republicans are seeing that the president is unpopular. %$* 506
they're on the ballot, and not him, and they're running away from him. %$* 506
i think democrats couldn't be happier. %$* 506
yes, but frist, in no way did this without the approval of the white house. %$* 422
yes, but you've got to say -- look, i mean, when democrats controlled the white house and democrats controlled the congress, they did the very same thing. %$* 360
they couldn't get a health care bill through. %$* 360
it isn't that much different than it is now. %$* 360
it's just sort of sausage. %$* 360
no, actually, i disagree. %$* 506
obviously, tough bills sometimes you can't get, but when the leader of your party -- i couldn't think of a time that george mitchell or tom daschle, the two democratic leaders in the senate with bill clinton was president, ever broke with him on a big important issue like this. %$* 506
and this is important to the president. %$* 506
it's going to put the president on the spot and force him to veto his first piece of legislation. %$* 506
and when you look at all of those trends, social security, iraq, free trade, now stem cells, republicans are breaking with president bush and you will see more of it. %$* 506
the next break will come on this karl rove thing. %$* 506
someone is going to stand up and break with the president and say it was wrong for them to mislead us on karl rove's roll... %$* 506
good luck, paul. %$* 422
well, someone should or they're all going to go down. %$* 506
you don't have any evidence. %$* 422
someone should. %$* 506
if you're in the white house right now and you're sitting in the situation room or whatever they call it, trying to figure out how do we handle this so everybody comes out smelling good, what would you do, bay? %$* 360
well, this is not what i would do, but what the white house will do. %$* 422
i happen to be a principled pro-lifer, so i would not do this. %$* 422
i think what they're going to do is go over to the senate and they're going to say, let's get something. %$* 422
you know, because the last time the president came out on stem cell, it wasn't a clean decision. %$* 422
it was -- it did not make us happy, i'll guarantee you. %$* 422
and i think they're going to start talking and come up with something that maybe the president is comfortable with. %$* 422
and it looks like he's bold and he's concerned about these millions of americans who are suffering and at the same time, he's holding on to his pro-life position. %$* 422
i don't know how you can do that and the pro-lifers won't buy it, but he's been reelected the second and last time. %$* 422
does this mean frist is not running for president? %$* 360
you know, that's the question. %$* 422
you really have to ask that, because unless -- no, frist has lost his pro-life credentials. %$* 422
he may not have had strong ones, but there's been themes he's taken and positions he's taken so he might be able to keep people out there. %$* 422
he has lost them. %$* 422
they are gone. %$* 422
and so, he is very badly hurt if he should choose to run, unless he thinks he can pick up the votes, the moderates that -- maybe mccain, he can beat mccain on the moderates. %$* 422
i don't see how that works for him. %$* 422
paul, does this help? %$* 360
does this help him if he were to run? %$* 360
no. %$* 506
it just shows -- you know what it shows you? %$* 506
politics is a tough business and you've got to admire people, whether it's president bush or president reagan or president clinton, who really excel at it. %$* 506
this guy is one of the most accomplished surgeons in americana, one of the most accomplished men in america and he's an inept politician. %$* 506
i'm sorry, but he looks like he learned how to dance at arthur murray's. %$* 506
you know, he's like: clunk, clunk, clunk. %$* 506
it's just not -- he's not a natural. %$* 506
and he's not a quick study either. %$* 422
no, he's not. %$* 506
all right. %$* 360
more in a minute. %$* 360
more inside politics ahead when we return. %$* 360
new salvos are lobbed in john bolton's battle to become ambassador to the u.n. one senator calls for withdrawal of his nomination as the white house considers a way to get him on the job right away. %$* 360
the "strategy session" continues on inside politics. %$* 360
still here, paul begala and bay buchanan. %$* 360
it's the confirmation controversy that just won't go away. %$* 360
john bolton still waits for confirmation as u.n. ambassador to the united nations. %$* 360
senior administration officials say the president may be able to get his man on the job right away with or without confirmation through a so-called recess appointment. %$* 360
that on the heels of news that bolton failed to disclose during the confirmation process that he'd been interviewed as part of a federal probe into suspected iraqi efforts to buy uranium from the country of niger. %$* 360
democratic senator barbara boxer of california in turn has called on president bush to pull bolton's nomination all together. %$* 360
and you know, we also have a letter from barbara boxer that she fired off. %$* 360
it has some pretty strong language. %$* 360
can you show that for a minute? %$* 360
it says, "mr. bolton's feeble admission that he was in fact interviewed by the inspector general's office is simply too little, too late and does not recognize the gravity of giving false information to a sate committee, which he swore was the truth." %$* 360
so paul begala, do you buy this? %$* 360
that this was, you know, just a little mistake? %$* 360
no. %$* 506
a mistake is if you misapply the pythagorean theorem right, that's a mistake. %$* 506
you get a question wrong. %$* 506
this ain't a question he's allowed to get wrong. %$* 506
it's under oath. %$* 506
now, i remember a time when the republican party was upset about alleged lies under oath about a girlfriend. %$* 506
this is about national security. %$* 506
and you don't forget, believe me, if you are interrogated about the most important scandal in american politics and one of the biggest security issues. %$* 506
you don't forget that. %$* 506
and this is damaging. %$* 506
the president's credibility is on the rocks. %$* 506
we have a majority of the country now who says that he misled us about the war. %$* 506
his numbers on honest and straightforward in the "wall street journal" poll have collapsed from as high as 70 now down to 41. %$* 506
and here's another example of the bush administration telling us one thing, then we find out it's not true. %$* 506
it's clear it was a mistake, because there is no reason why a man who clearly is not part of this investigation, he hasn't been deposed, he hasn't been in front with the grand jury, everybody agrees he is not central to this investigation whatsoever. %$* 422
and so why would he lie? %$* 422
there's no good reason for him to lie. %$* 422
and i'm going to tell you, i was in the government as  united states, and you know the inspector general. %$* 422
you know, that's somebody that works in your department. %$* 422
and how many times he came up and said i've got a few questions for you. %$* 422
that was not -- i would never have interpreted that -- that as kind of an inquiry. %$* 422
if he's that sloppy, then do we want him at the u.n.? %$* 506
and he obviously said -- he said no to the guy, he didn't know anything and the guy investigation pursues. %$* 422
he is not part of that investigation. %$* 422
and i don't believe it was a lie. %$* 422
do you think the president goes forward with the recess appointment? %$* 360
absolutely. %$* 422
you just said, joe, this is a controversy that will not go away. %$* 422
the president wants it to go away, i know how, recess appointment gives you all a couple days to beat him on up for it. %$* 422
and it's a done deal. %$* 422
he comes back in the fall and this is history. %$* 422
begala: the problem with that is it's bad for america. %$* 422
pat roberts, the republican chairman of the intelligence committee has said this will harm america's ability -- a recess appointment, this is the president's party, and the president's chairman of the intelligence committee in the senate says it will hurt america's ability to be represented with credibility and support at the u.n. and i think he's right. %$* 422
there's a lot of able conservatives out there. %$* 422
bay buchanan would be a fine ambassador to the u.n. let's put her up there, because she tells the truth. %$* 422
so, why don't we have somebody credible? %$* 422
all right. %$* 360
say the president goes forward with the recess appointment. %$* 360
does it have any fallout once we get to the supreme court nomination issues in the fall? %$* 360
i don't believe it does at all. %$* 422
listen, there's -- if he were to pull this -- bolton, pull him off the table and say let's go somewhere else, we gain nothing. %$* 422
we gain absolutely nothing. %$* 422
the democrats are going to say what a great guy, we're going to help him on the next one? %$* 422
forget it. %$* 422
they don't like the president. %$* 422
they're going to hurt him everywhere they can. %$* 422
they're going to fight roberts, because they don't like what he stands for either. %$* 422
we gain nothing. %$* 422
and we do -- if he does put him up there, he gains all kinds of credibility. %$* 422
america says, the man is a leader, the president is a leader. %$* 422
he gets the ambassador he wants. %$* 422
the senate does support him. %$* 422
he could go through if they give him a vote. %$* 422
he would pass. %$* 422
so, let's move on to the next issue. %$* 422
the last two -- democrats opposed the president when they can and should, but not all the time. %$* 506
but the last two ambassadors the president has sent to the u.n. were confirmed unanimously, senator danforth and ambassador negroponte. %$* 506
there are plenty of able, pro-bush conservatives who can articulate the president's case and america's case at the u.n. %$* 506
this is hurting him. %$* 506
and the president's credibility is collapsing. %$* 506
and this hurts it one more time. %$* 506
we have one more case where he's misled the country. %$* 506
all right. %$* 360
let's take another break. %$* 360
still three years to go until the next election, but there are some familiar faces showing up a lot more lately. %$* 360
when we come back, why john edwards and others might be spending more time in the public eye and particularly in new hampshire these days. %$* 360
i'm andrea koppel reporting from washington. %$* 518
coming up at the top of the hour, authorities say all four suspects in last week's london bombing attempts are now in custody. %$* 518
we'll have the very latest on today's arrests. %$* 518
a top republican changes his position on stem cell research. %$* 518
a look at the potential impact. %$* 518
and the discovery astronauts inspect their shuttle for damage. %$* 518
we'll hear the crew's reaction to the launch problem. %$* 518
all those stories and much, much more just minutes away on wolf blitzer reports. %$* 518
now back to inside politics. %$* 518
thanks, andrea. %$* 360
the "strategy session" continues on inside politics. %$* 360
still here, paul begala and bay buchanan. %$* 360
president bush has three-plus years to go on the job, but the scent of the presidential race is already in the air. %$* 360
democratic senator joe biden is writing a book, former democratic running mates john kerry and john edwards are spending more time in new hampshire. %$* 360
and last night, the presence of two senators, one republican and one democrat, together at a movie premiere prompted this comment from producer harvey weinstein. %$* 360
ladies and gentlemen, i'd also like to introduce you to the first great 2008 bipartisan presidential ticket -- i'll let them figure out the order of that -- senator hillary clinton and senator john mccain. %$* 514
it's harvey weinstein, my apologies to hollywood. %$* 360
so, what does this mean? %$* 360
first, kerry, edwards, new hampshire? %$* 360
what do they have to do next time to get it right? %$* 360
that's the question democrats are going to ask them. %$* 506
these guys going up there, they have a perfect , they are bright people. %$* 506
they're talented people. %$* 506
they ran a disastrous campaign in 2004. %$* 506
the president to his credit ran a brilliant campaign. %$* 506
but senators edwards and -- senators kerry and edwards in that order ran a terrible campaign. %$* 506
and democrats are going to want to know, did you learn anything? %$* 506
did you get a clue? %$* 506
are you going to run a smarter, tougher, meaner campaign the next time around? %$* 506
and they're going to have to answer that. %$* 506
that'll be the first question out of everybody's mouth when they see them. %$* 506
and there's something else this tells us, is that the democrats, in spite of what washington says, have not have not decided that the nominee is hillary clinton. %$* 422
that they feel that there is a possibility here that she should have serious competition in this primary, and that she will have. %$* 422
and i think you are going to see this primary fill up. %$* 422
and hillary's problem is, the expectation game is going against her. %$* 422
everybody expects her to be the frontrunner. %$* 422
everybody expects her do very well and take over. %$* 422
and if they can knock her off just a little bit, throw her off her game in those first couple primaries, she can be hurt. %$* 422
i think that's right. %$* 506
but that's the position your former boss ronald reagan was in going into 1980. %$* 506
he was the favorite and the most talented one in the field. %$* 506
he had some early stumbles, but you know what? %$* 506
it did him good, i think, to be challenged in a tough way, especially by later president bush -- george h.w. %$* 506
bush. %$* 506
and this could work out very well for the democrats. %$* 506
i'm not one who wants only one strong candidate and a lot of weak ones. %$* 506
i hope for my party's sake there's a whole lot of very able candidates. %$* 506
senator mccain has restarted his political action committee. %$* 360
we've all assumed that he was going to run. %$* 360
do you see anything that he needs to do from the last time he ran to try to juice it up a bit? %$* 360
he's damaged goods. %$* 422
you know, first of all, the social conservatives obviously have his number and they're not the least bit interested in seeing him be the nominee. %$* 422
so, he's up against that. %$* 422
but then, what's he doing these last couple months is, he goes against the establishment. %$* 422
he plays this game with the nuclear option. %$* 422
holds up the judges. %$* 422
that filibuster game he played. %$* 422
and so the establishment -- i've done traveling in these early states now in the last couple months, i've been in the primary states. %$* 422
and the establishment republicans are furious with this fellow. %$* 422
they are just angry an as they can be, because he didn't -- he allowed the filibuster game to continue. %$* 422
so i think that he is damaged. %$* 422
i think he's troubled. %$* 422
and i think his game plan is going to be six or eight or 10 people in this race. %$* 422
if he can just hold on to the moderate vote and the liberal vote of the party and get some of that crossover vote in places like south carolina, then he might be able to slip through. %$* 422
so, do you really think hillary rodham clinton is sort of the presumptive favorite? %$* 360
she's the favorite. %$* 506
but she's first got to win her own reelection, then she's got to decide whether she wants to run. %$* 506
i know everybody who sort of yacks about it, presumes that. %$* 506
but i've talked to her and she hasn't decided. %$* 506
she's still focusing on her reelection in new york. %$* 506
this is very smart. %$* 506
this is what governor george w. bush did in texas. %$* 506
when he got into '97, '98, people though, oh, he should be the frontrunner. %$* 506
and ultimately he wound up running. %$* 506
but he was very smart. %$* 506
he focused on getting reelected in his state first and then he let the future take care of itself. %$* 506
that's what any smart politician does. %$* 506
who does the white house want? %$* 360
the nominee? %$* 422
yeah. %$* 360
who do they like? %$* 360
buchanan: i would have said frist, but now i'm not so sure. %$* 360
do you think this does it for him? %$* 360
whether they want him or not, yes, he's in trouble. %$* 422
you know, as i said, he might feel that he can run a moderate campaign and the establishment will move mccain aside. %$* 422
i don't know. %$* 422
i don't know that the white house any one person -- who's the president want? %$* 422
i really don't know. %$* 422
i know he's very close to frist. %$* 422
and i think he feels he owes frist. %$* 422
but i think there's a lot of people up there he feels he owes. %$* 422
i know allen is running strong in a lot of circles. %$* 422
and there's a number of other people that are going to be in there. %$* 422
brownback? %$* 360
brownback looks like he's running. %$* 422
you have mitt romney who's running. %$* 422
you have the governor down there in alabama, the old fellow used to be chairman of the party -- haley barber. %$* 422
got you. %$* 360
yes. %$* 360
sure, haley barber is running. %$* 422
at some point, george w. bush i think will want to weigh in on this. %$* 506
maybe he'll be like president reagan and largely stay out of it. %$* 506
i suspect he won't. %$* 506
he's not somebody who doesn't know his own mind. %$* 506
you know what, like him or not -- i actually like him but don't support him -- he can make a dang decision. %$* 506
and at some point, he is going to weigh in. %$* 506
he may go -- call me crazy, he may go to dick cheney and say you know dick, i thought long and hard that you'd be the best person to be president if i couldn't be. %$* 506
you should run. %$* 506
music to my ears as a democrat. %$* 506
we'd beat him like a bad piece of meat. %$* 506
maybe condoleezza rice would be his favorite. %$* 506
somebody who he is very personally close to and has enough confidence in to put at the state department. %$* 506
i think the bush primary could be the most interesting and important primary in the republican party. %$* 506
how, they'll work it is the president will stay neutral. %$* 422
they'll get rove working it. %$* 422
and rove will bring in the party establishment and all the different states and put it all together is what i suspect. %$* 422
but what i hear is that rove is for -- rove is mostly for his own hide right now trying to get out of trouble. %$* 506
but, he's for dr. frist, is that right? %$* 506
he is very tight with dr. frist. %$* 422
that's his choice. %$* 422
that's who he put right into that place over there. %$* 422
so, what happens now, i don't really know. %$* 422
i think they're going to have trouble picking and choosing. %$* 422
there's been a lot of good people in this race. %$* 422
and you're going to have some populists like tom trancredo out there. %$* 422
so, there are going to be lots of interest. %$* 422
there's also been a lot of talk about frist and this being a liability for him. %$* 360
but so many people on capitol hill have said that he's been too much in the tow of the white house. %$* 360
is this perhaps an opportunity for him to show a little bit of independence? %$* 360
yes. %$* 422
but when you show your independence, you don't know it in a way that harms you from the primary races. %$* 422
and that is what he's done. %$* 422
i think he looks as if maybe he was too close to the president. %$* 422
now maybe he's too close to the corporate world. %$* 422
this does not help you with a populist conservative base of the party. %$* 422
but this is why i love and admire john mccain, because you have to. %$* 506
they won't let you appear on television unless you do. %$* 506
but who does he go to? %$* 506
the republican party seems to me consists of pro-life christian conservatives and tax cutters. %$* 506
he's pro-life, but he's against the christian conservatives on many issues and he's against the tax cuts. %$* 506
and establishment republicans on top of that. %$* 422
and now he's offended them. %$* 422
end it there. %$* 360
all right. %$* 360
thanks so much to both of you. %$* 360
appreciate you coming in. %$* 360
bay buchanan, paul begala, see you next time. %$* 360
conservative bloggers are attacking the liberal radio network air america, now under investigation for alleged corruption. %$* 360
we'll check in with our blog reporters when inside politics returns. %$* 360
air america radio is attracting a lot of attention from bloggers today. %$* 360
for more on that, let's check in with cnn political producer abbi tatton, and jacki schechner, our blog reporter -- jacki. %$* 360
hi, joe. %$* 325
well, many of the conservative bloggers are talking about a new york investigation into the possible diversion of funds from an inner city boys and girls club to the liberal radio station air america. %$* 325
this started with brian maloney over at theradioequalizer.blogspot.com. %$* 325
he picked up a small mention as part of a larger article in the "new york daily news." %$* 325
and as part of that article, it turns out that the former ceo of air america was also on the board of that boys and girls club. %$* 325
and that's where the investigation continues right now into what sort of diversion of funds may have taken place. %$* 325
working with brian maloney on the store is michele malkin at michelemalkin.com. %$* 384
she's been really pushing it. %$* 384
this is a blogger driven story that she feels is not getting enough coverage in the mainstream media. %$* 384
michele has been linking to statements put out from air america on this case. %$* 384
what they're essentially saying is the funds in question that are being investigated were to previous business owners of air america, that they have nothing to do with those preview business owners and so they are not responsible for what's going on here. %$* 384
the debate carrying on at dailykos.com, whether webmaster of air america, that's adam mordecai, is posting the most recent statement saying that they have no obligation to the previous business owners, but their still working with the boys and girls club. %$* 384
and very much the boys and girls club very much has the support of air america. %$* 384
that did not stop the conservative blogs from posting all sorts of headlines like "al franken steals money from kids and old folks" or things like jacklewis.net, "liberals stealing from poor kids." %$* 325
they really, you could take your pick of blogs on this one. %$* 325
that sort of vein. %$* 325
but over at the larger blogs like whizbangblog.com, they're doing what michele malkin and what brian are doing, and they're looking deeper into the statement from air america saying whatever the answers are at this point, it's not enough for them. %$* 325
and they are going to continue to push the investigation. %$* 325
joe, we will send it back to you. %$* 325
that's it for inside politics. %$* 360
i'm joe johns. %$* 360
wolf blitzer reports starts right now. %$* 360

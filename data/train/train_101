trump keeps talking, and the controversies keep coming. %$* 334
isis is honoring president obama. %$* 5
he is the founder of isis. %$* 5
now, some republicans want the party to put its money where his mouth isn't, on more winnable races. %$* 334
newly revealed e-mails raise more troubling questions about the clinton foundation's ties to the state department. %$* 334
a couple of very bad ones came out. %$* 5
and it's called pay-for- play. %$* 5
and some of these were really, really bad and illegal. %$* 5
the battle for blue-collar voters. %$* 334
there is a myth out there that he will stick it to the rich and powerful because somehow he's really on the side of the little guy. %$* 149
don't believe it. %$* 149
and clinton's challenge to trump: release your tax returns. %$* 334
inside politics -- the biggest stories sourced by the best reporters -- now. %$* 334
welcome to inside politics, everyone. %$* 334
thanks for sharing your sunday morning with us. %$* 334
i'm kate bolduan, in for john king. %$* 334
it's been three tumultuous, to say the very least, weeks since donald trump's nominating convention. %$* 334
the week -- this week, the republican candidate called president obama the founder of isis and made a second amendment comment that critics called out of bounds, just the latest in a series of controversial comments that have prompted some gopers to urge the head of the rnc to run, not walk away from donald trump. %$* 334
cnn's phil mattingly and our m.j. lee, maggie haberman of "the new york times", and errol louis of time warner cable news. %$* 960
it's been less than a week, but it's already hard to remember that it was supposed to be a week of donald trump staying on topic, staying on message. %$* 960
instead, he ignited a firestorm with a remark about second amendment people doing something about hillary clinton and her liberal judges. %$* 960
then, we got a two-day tangent about the founders of isis. %$* 960
he is the founder of isis. %$* 5
he is the founder of isis. %$* 5
i call president obama and hillary clinton the founders of isis. %$* 5
they're the founders. %$* 5
barack obama and hillary clinton, these are the founders of isis. %$* 5
last night, you said the president was the founder of isis. %$* 473
i know what you meant. %$* 473
you meant that he created the vacuum, he lost the peace. %$* 473
no. %$* 5
i meant he's the founder of isis. %$* 5
i do. %$* 5
he is the most valuable player. %$* 5
i give him the most valuable player award. %$* 5
i give her too, by the way, hillary clinton. %$* 5
but he is not sympathetic to them. %$* 473
he hates them. %$* 473
he's trying to kill them. %$* 473
i don't care. %$* 5
he was the founder. %$* 5
trump making himself pretty clear right there, right? %$* 334
well, not exactly. %$* 334
i said, obama is the founder of isis. %$* 5
the founder. %$* 5
and these dishonest media people, they're the most dishonest people, they said, oh, did he mean that? %$* 5
didn't he mean that? %$* 5
i said the founder of isis. %$* 5
obviously i'm being sarcastic. %$* 5
then, then -- but not that sarcastic, to be honest with you. %$* 5
what? %$* 334
last night, we got another tangent. %$* 334
monica lewinsky's infamous blue dress made it back into the speech. %$* 334
but don't blame the candidate for getting off topic. %$* 334
trump says, blame the messenger. %$* 334
i'm not running against crooked hillary clinton. %$* 5
i'm running against the crooked media. %$* 5
that's what i'm running against. %$* 5
it's true. %$* 5
let us begin. %$* 334
errol louis, blame the media, that's, one, not new for any politician. %$* 334
two, not new especially for donald trump. %$* 334
but he took it to -- it felt like a whole new level last night with the -- they're turning off their cameras when clearly that's not true. %$* 334
they're not turning off their cameras. %$* 334
it's a pool camera as he's railing against the media. %$* 334
he thinks it's working. %$* 334
yes? %$* 334
well, it works for him in the room at the time. %$* 347
this really reflects, i think, the problem that donald trump is sort of mired in, which is that the 5,000, 10,000, even 20,000 people in front of him will be delighted by these comments. %$* 347
nobody else really cares. %$* 347
it starts to sound like whining at a certain point. %$* 347
it also -- you know, people are -- in the cases that he says the media has somehow distorted things and been crooked, it's the kind of sequence that you just showed where people can see with their own eyes that it's not like some producer or some cameraman caught him in some off moment. %$* 347
he says over and over and over again the president is the founder of isis. %$* 347
then he sort of reverses it and then reverses the reversal and somehow it's all the media's fault. %$* 347
i think most people are sophisticated enough to realize that it's not all the media's fault. %$* 347
it doesn't -- it kind of wastes time, because here again, we're still not talking -- we're not hearing him talk about jobs or about trade, one of his signature issues. %$* 347
we're not hearing him talk about public security or any of the things that are supposed to get him across the finish line. %$* 347
and in some ways, it's really a distraction from his own message. %$* 347
it became really the main message coming out of last night. %$* 334
i guess maybe first i need to ask, are you sure you have your press credentials after his speech last night, maggie? %$* 334
he seemed uncertain whether he was banning. %$* 144
he was thinking about it. %$* 144
it's true. %$* 334
he was thinking. %$* 334
he was mulling it over, but getting to your reporting, fascinating reporting that donald trump took particular exception with and kind of the amendments to have the man pivot and the man that they're dealing with now. %$* 334
there was an enormous amount of frustration. %$* 144
this was a story that my colleague alex burns and i spent a lot of time on. %$* 144
there is an enormous amount of frustration by people close to the campaign, in the campaign, around the candidate, who see basically, you know, it get announced every couple of days, there is going to be this new version of him this week or he's going to do a speech or read off a teleprompter. %$* 144
and, that's now where the bar will be set for him doing better. %$* 144
and that's not what his instinct is. %$* 144
his instinct is to do what we saw last night from that video. %$* 144
and there is sort of a groundhog day about this and we do this all over again. %$* 144
so, our story began about the need for him to get in gear about this and focus on a teleprompter and give more sort of targeted events on june 20th, the day that he fired his campaign manager. %$* 144
there was another meeting similar to the need for a change in tone and comportment that was held just this past week, right before his second amendment comments from a rally that became very controversial. %$* 144
what we saw last night, too, at the rally is trump says -- to errol's point about, you know, people can see for themselves. %$* 144
trump says they put three people, it's all on the sources. %$* 144
we had five people on the record, including one of them, the former partner of his top adviser. %$* 144
trump has been effective at structuring the narrative how he wants to. %$* 144
it's much harder to do that in a general election. %$* 144
and the people you're talking to, are they getting to the point of finally giving up on the idea there will be a pivot? %$* 334
they're approaching the point where they're not sure how coachable he is. %$* 144
i mean, he can get to a person point and after that it's very hard for him. %$* 144
look, there is a lot of frustration, there's a lot of anxiety and there's also a lot of the fact that the candidate himself is very upset and is lashing out. %$* 144
candidates very rarely tend to blame themselves. %$* 144
this is not unique to trump. %$* 144
but it may be more pronounced with him. %$* 144
that's a good point. %$* 334
also, kind of maybe it dovetails into maggie's reporting, is this new tone this week. %$* 334
for the first time acknowledging or at least setting a bar of i might not win, i might actually lose. %$* 334
and the comment in the interview about it, it's ok, i'll just take a very, very long vacation. %$* 334
what do you think is behind that, phil? %$* 334
well, i'm tracking with a lot of reporters who are planning very, very long vacations after the election at some point. %$* 742
i think there is for the first time a recognition when he is looking at the poll numbers which were the basis for so much of his remarks throughout the primary. %$* 742
when he's looking at kind of the mechanics of how campaigns work. %$* 742
when he's watching what's going on around him. %$* 742
not attacks from democrats, not attacks from the media, attacks from inside his own party that this isn't that fun, a, and, b, this is a very complicated process. %$* 742
and i think that's something i took out of maggie and alex's reporting more than anything else, is that campaigns are hard. %$* 742
campaign -- the process of campaigning is difficult. %$* 742
the process of running a campaign is extraordinarily difficult. %$* 742
you sense that there is a lot of frustration and a lot of, man, i didn't know this was what it's all about. %$* 742
you're struck consistently by when you talk to his senior advisers, they're unified and they believe this is a path forward, there's a message forward, there are serious opportunities for donald trump going forward. %$* 742
it's his inability to kind of follow that pathway that breeds a lot of the frustration, and i think you're seeing his frustration when he makes comments like that. %$* 742
and maybe coming off that frustration, donald trump, instead of taking the message his advisers want and push that message forward, he's already taking on the message that the election is rigged. %$* 334
he pushed that message last night in pennsylvania about pennsylvania. %$* 334
let's show it for the viewers. %$* 334
call up law enforcement, and we have to have the sheriffs and police chiefs and everybody watching, because, if we get cheated out of this election, if we get cheated out of a win in pennsylvania, which is such a vital state, especially when i know what's happening here, folks. %$* 5
i know she can't beat what's happening here. %$* 5
the only way they can beat it in my opinion -- and i mean this 100 percent -- if in certain sections of the state, they cheat. %$* 5
and the campaign now, m.j., they're asking people to sign up on the website to be election monitors, to look for fraud. %$* 334
what are they going to use these e-mail lists for? %$* 334
what do you take from it? %$* 334
one thing that i thought was really striking, maggie, in your story with alex, is that we're three months out from election day and we're seeing a portrait of a campaign in total, you know, despair and a candidate that is very frustrated, not to mention the aides that are around him. %$* 207
it's very unusual to see a story like this so far out from election day. %$* 207
and i think donald trump, you know, as we have seen over and over throughout this election, he is someone that likes to take things to the extreme and really sort of test how far he can take things. %$* 207
the problem for him, though, is at this point in the election, voters really want to be convinced that he is a serious candidate. %$* 207
we have anecdotal evidence of this kind of thing really hurting him. %$* 207
on this issue, though, that donald trump kind of laying the %$* 366
groundwork that the election is rigged. %$* 366
it's striking that while you are asking people to sign up as an election monitor, to look for fraud, in your website, why aren't you asking them to sign up to get out to vote? %$* 366
i wonder -- to me, that's striking, is he trying to manage expectations or set the bar for "this is who i can blame if i lose"? %$* 366
i mean, there are a lot of people came away with the thought that that's what he's looking for, as a way to say that if this does not go as planned -- but you're correct that there are republicans who are watching this and saying, why would you be spending this much energy on this. %$* 961
and to be clear, having poll watchers is not unusual. %$* 961
this is done in lots of campaigns. %$* 961
the question that arose about his doing it is that there is an rnc consent decree about how this can be done and whether it would work. %$* 961
his campaign is not the rnc, but why are you not also trying to open up a number of field offices? %$* 961
why have you not been doing that all along? %$* 961
why are you not trying to develop a targeted data program? %$* 961
why are you not trying to make sure that you have sort of a specific message? %$* 961
to the media point about the things he's complaining about and about it being rigged, he is at the end of the day really just bringing the focus back onto himself over and over. %$* 961
the media is out to get me. %$* 961
the polls are rigged and cheating me. %$* 961
voters vote on the economy, they vote on terrorism, national security issues. %$* 961
but they vote on issues for their own lives. %$* 961
donald trump's treatment is not, other than for his hardest fans, not among them for most of the voters. %$* 961
you know, he has a paid media problem. %$* 347
and it may not be the one that he thinks it is. %$* 347
and, you know, he has a paid media problem, right? %$* 347
so, cnn reporting that since the end of the primary season, the clinton campaign has spent close to $43 million on ads. %$* 347
the trump campaign has spent zero. %$* 347
if you pass up all of these opportunities to have a carefully crafted, targeted message that you can send over and over again to the people who you most need to get it to, if you pass on that opportunity, the numbers are go against you in the polls, the morale in your campaign will fall apart. %$* 347
i mean, he's really sort of reaping what he sowed. %$* 347
if he can get that back on track, he has a chance to get back in. %$* 347
let's talk about ground game just one second guys. %$* 334
coming up next, some republicans say it' time to cut and run away from donald trump. %$* 334
we're going to discuss where they want the gop to cut and run to, put its money and its efforts now. %$* 334
but, first, politicians say the darnedest things. %$* 334
what's in a name? %$* 334
a lot according to hillary clinton. %$* 334
she noticed a trend when it comes to donald trump's economic council. %$* 334
well, so today in detroit, he's got, i don't know, dozen or so economic advisors he just named. %$* 149
hedge fund guys, billionaire guys. %$* 149
six guys named steve, apparently. %$* 149
some republicans are worried. %$* 334
they're frustrated with the top of their ticket and they're scared about what kind of trump effect they'll see trickle down. %$* 334
but, if you've watched rnc's reince priebus in the last few days, it is all fun and dandy and wonderful. %$* 334
nothing to see here. %$* 334
in the same week he talked to trump about the direction of his campaign and its impact on down ballot races, the head of the party tried public unity on for size, telling supporters, "hey, all good." %$* 334
we're so honored to be working with donald trump and the campaign that raised $82 million in july to beat hillary clinton. %$* 356
and don't believe the garbage you read. %$* 356
let me tell you something. %$* 356
donald trump, the republican party, all of you, we're going to put him in the white house and save this country together. %$* 356
but the pressure is on for priebus. %$* 334
dozens of republicans are circulating a letter urging the party to pull resources away from trump and focus on more vulnerable house and senate races. %$* 334
the letter did not mince words. %$* 334
here's what it said in part, "we believe that donald trump's divisiveness and record breaking unpopularity risk turning the election into a democratic landslide and only the immediate shift of all available rnc resources to vulnerable senate and house races will prevent the gop from drowning with a trump emblazoned anchor around its neck." %$* 334
so, phil, tell me how you really feel is i think the question there. %$* 334
what is going -- what is the calculation? %$* 334
what is the conversation for reince priebus right now? %$* 334
subtle message from those republicans. %$* 742
the reality is the rnc is all in with trump, whether they like it or not. %$* 742
they have joint fundraising with him. %$* 742
he is a big part of their fund-raising operation. %$* 742
that's not just nothing. %$* 334
that's a real thing. %$* 334
absolutely. %$* 742
you can't just break that away. %$* 334
they signed an agreement. %$* 742
that agreement stands through november. %$* 742
that is very real for them. %$* 742
and i think, look, reince priebus, more than anybody else, was the one who declared donald trump the presumptive republican nominee. %$* 742
he has done everything in his power with regular phone calls behind the scenes with donald trump, phone calls with other republicans to try and make this work. %$* 742
that's why you saw him out showing this public front of unity. %$* 742
but i think the interesting thing here, as you watch the republican party and its growing uneasiness right now, they're all looking down- ballot. %$* 742
you are not going to see -- a lot of republicans are pregnant here, if you will. %$* 742
they've backed him. %$* 742
they're for him. %$* 742
they felt like there was no other option with him at the top of the ticket. %$* 742
when do you see them start to drive off the ship? %$* 742
senators that are running for reelection, house members that are all running for re- election. %$* 742
it's all about poll numbers. %$* 742
and it's all about looking at the reality of, if their races are actually in jeopardy. %$* 742
i don't think we're at the tipping point yet, but we're walking up to it right now. %$* 742
and i think that's the concern if you're reince priebus and the republican party. %$* 742
you can't have that happen right now because unity matters, until they decide to break off and do all the down ballot focus. %$* 742
is this a different conversation at the end of september, beginning of october than right now in august? %$* 334
there are a lot of questions about the timing of when you do this, and for a couple of reasons, as you just said, a lot of it is on polls. %$* 144
but remember, donald trump, he has a base of support that's not grown. %$* 144
but that is the base of the republican party. %$* 144
and so, you have a lot of senators who are going to need those voters and especially you have a lot of congress who are going to need those voters. %$* 144
there is concern, about, if you break off at a certain point, do the votes still come out? %$* 144
that is what people are balancing, and that's a real issue. %$* 144
doesn't research show that voters don't really split the ticket anymore, right? %$* 334
well, less so. %$* 347
when you have a polarized electorate like we have now, they're pretty much going to stay within their party. %$* 347
so, the notion of widespread ticket splitting is not realistic in this, or really other elections these days. %$* 347
right. %$* 334
the breaking point i'm hearing people will be watching for is that first debate. %$* 347
if he kills it in the first debate, they have a chance to sort of bring everything back together and say that's our standard bearer, that's the guy who's going to take us over the finish line. %$* 347
if he bombs, if he has a problem in that debate, then that will be the point where things like the letter you just excerpted, you're going to hear that much more publicly and much more loudly, and that decision will have to be made at that point. %$* 347
m.j., look at the map. %$* 334
why spend time -- when you are having trouble bringing in more voters, why spend time in places like connecticut? %$* 334
why spend time in places like maine, when you're looking at traditional republican strongholds, they're kind of in question right now. %$* 334
yes, i think this is yet another example of donald trump fundamentally misreading what you need to do to win a presidential election. %$* 207
yes, we have talked so much about how sort of skilled he was at reaching out to the republican base during the primaries, but that is so different from what he needs to achieve to be victorious in november. %$* 207
and i think if you look at some of the republican members of congress who have come out against donald trump, the dave reicherts of the world, charlie dents of the world, they represent districts that are relatively affluent suburbs. %$* 207
and i think that really goes to show sort of the weakness behind donald trump's strategy. %$* 207
you know, if you're not winning the minority vote, you have to win with a working class and educated white voters, and we know he's not doing well with educated white voters. %$* 207
that doesn't leave much in terms of support heading into november. %$* 207
after we look at polls out this week, and yes, again, snapshot in time, all the caveats, but when you look at north carolina struck me when it out. %$* 334
he's really down. %$* 334
this is a place that he really needs to hold when you look at his map. %$* 334
are we to a place, phil, where you think you can say, he already had a narrow path, and it is very much narrowing now? %$* 334
no question about it. %$* 742
and, look, you look at, is georgia going to turn blue? %$* 742
pretty unlikely. %$* 742
people have been predicting that for the last four cycles and republicans always figure out a way to win. %$* 742
but again, the fact that it's close causes a lot of consternation in the republican party. %$* 742
perhaps he has to spend money there. %$* 742
that would be a surprise, but that would be severely problematic. %$* 742
when you look at the states where he absolutely almost has to win with the path that we've been looking at. %$* 742
north carolina he has to hold. %$* 742
pennsylvania everybody says he has to win. %$* 742
ohio has kind of the voter demographic that he continues to point to as his pathway forward. %$* 742
what's your home state again, phil? %$* 962
it's ohio. %$* 742
it's cool. %$* 742
but no, so you talk about ground game. %$* 742
you talk about what matters. %$* 742
ground game in states, battle ground states is hugely important. %$* 742
in ohio, tons of resources should be there. %$* 742
the clinton campaign is there in force and with good reason. %$* 742
the ohio democratic party has had rough, couple of cycles here. %$* 742
donald trump's presence there, while he's hired some solid top-tier staffer is minimal. %$* 742
one republican there on the ground i talked to this week said it was dismal, his operation there. %$* 742
there's pretty good reason why. %$* 742
that state is super plugged with john kasich, the governor of ohio, who beat donald trump by 240,000 votes in march. %$* 742
that team, if donald trump could activate them, could win the state for donald trump. %$* 742
and yet, all he's done, he and his campaign team, is just battled with kasich's. %$* 742
kasich's operation is frozen. %$* 742
the ohio republican party is mostly frozen and donald trump is now in a major deficit both spending, staffing, data, in the state that he has to win. %$* 742
again, so many people are scratching their heads why he was taking on kasich when he was in ohio, at the convention. %$* 334
why continue to beat that how he was. %$* 334
stand by, guys. %$* 334
lot more to come. %$* 334
coming up, including this, new e-mail questions for hillary clinton bring up new concerns about her time as secretary of state. %$* 334
but, first, please take our inside politics quiz of the day. %$* 334
who would be best to handle the economy? %$* 334
hillary clinton, donald trump, gary johnson or jill stein? %$* 334
tell us now at cnn.com/vote. %$* 334
hillary clinton is again at the center of an e- mail controversy. %$* 334
a conservative watchdog group released nearly 300 pages of e-mails from clinton's time as secretary of state. %$* 334
they raise questions about the clinton's foundation -- the clinton foundation's influence on the clinton state department. %$* 334
donald trump wasted no time bringing it up and labeling it pay-for- play politics. %$* 334
listen. %$* 334
but a couple of very bad ones came our and it's called pay- for-play. %$* 5
and some of these were really, really bad and illegal. %$* 5
if it's true, it's illegal. %$* 5
you are paying and you're getting things. %$* 5
in a statement released wednesday, the clinton campaign brushed aside the accusations saying this, "hillary clinton never took action as secretary of state because of donations to the clinton foundation." %$* 334
republicans aren't the only ones raising questions about the clinton foundation. %$* 334
the fbi and justice department also wanted to know more about the relationship between the state department and clinton's charity. %$* 334
officials tell cnn authorities discussed opening up a public corruption case but eventually doj officials decided not to pursue it. %$* 334
here's my issue with the e-mail issues. %$* 334
it's compounding that you almost have to talk about which e-mail problem we're discussing at this point. %$* 334
i think that, even without getting into the details, speaks volumes to the problem hillary clinton has with -- it just muddies the waters and speaks to a branding that donald trump has successfully kind of labeled her with. %$* 334
well, it speaks to the perception that's existed with the clintons for decades now, right? %$* 742
that's the interesting element here. %$* 742
the clinton campaign has been furious all week about the reporting related to the e-mails, about the reporting related to cheryl mills going up to new york on personal her time to interview people with the clinton foundation. %$* 742
they say we're making a lot out of a little. %$* 334
we're making a lot out of something that doesn't exist. %$* 742
there is no evidence that hillary clinton had anything to do with the e-mails, all of this stuff. %$* 742
but again, it feeds into the idea the clintons have a different set of rules, it feeds into the idea the clinton foundation is some type of corrupt pay-for-play organization. %$* 742
again, there is no smoking gun. %$* 742
there is no direct evidence that there is pay-for-play. %$* 742
but this is what people think of when the trust numbers for hillary clinton are in such a bad position. %$* 742
the more these things come out, they give donald trump and his campaign opportunities to talk about the trust issues a hopefully for their cases, build that case against hillary clinton. %$* 742
i think that's the biggest issue here is that she has major trust issues to begin with. %$* 742
all of this type of stuff feeds that narrative. %$* 742
beyond the public outrage thing, we're all making something out of nothing, funny, we hear that from both candidates on different topics. %$* 334
do you sense that there is concern, though, on the political -- the political problem this continues to feed for hillary clinton? %$* 334
does team clinton sense that? %$* 334
well, there is a political problem. %$* 347
they are very well-aware of it and they've done something that her husband bill clinton always did, which is just pivot away from it. %$* 347
not just sort of downplay it and say, well, it's much ado about nothing. %$* 347
but, also say, if you're not going to trust me, at least find me useful. %$* 347
i care about people like you. %$* 347
i have a program that you're going to like. %$* 347
i've got a track record that you can respect. %$* 347
that's what she does over and over again. %$* 347
it seems to work because the same polls that show her as being less than honest and trustworthy are also polls that are showing her doing better than donald trump. %$* 347
so, as a practical matter, she can find her way out of it. %$* 347
i think what both sides are missing is that you have to be specific. %$* 347
it's not enough to say, oh, it's crooked hillary or it's pay-to-play. %$* 347
you have to go through it. %$* 347
what exactly is wrong with having cheryl mills go to new york where, at her level, she is basically always on company time for the state department, and act as a personnel sort of manager representing her interests there? %$* 347
what will happen if hillary clinton becomes president, what happens to the foundation? %$* 347
what happens to those relationships? %$* 347
what will her staff members be doing? %$* 347
what did she imply or direct her staff members to do? %$* 347
it needs to be a specific and sort of sophisticated conversation. %$* 347
much more in depth than you can do from a podium at a big rally. %$* 347
maggie, bill clinton was asked by -- was asked, kind of a post a question by hillary clinton supporter on friday about why americans should trust his wife when she lied about her e-mails. %$* 334
listen to this. %$* 334
wait a minute. %$* 149
that's it. %$* 149
it's not true. %$* 149
the fbi director said, when he testified before congress, he had to amend his previous day's statement that she had never received any e- mails marked classified. %$* 149
they saw two little notes with a "c" on it. %$* 149
this is the biggest load of bull i ever heard -- that were about telephone calls that she needed to make, and the state department typically puts a little "c" on it to discourage people from discussing it in public. %$* 149
does that sound threatening to the national security to you? %$* 149
bill clinton is doing what bill clinton does, he is trying to explain it. %$* 334
he is saying, the answer is it's not truthful. %$* 334
do not listen to this. %$* 334
right. %$* 144
i mean, he's getting -- the times when you see bill clinton get most frustrated in when he feels she is being attacked. %$* 144
and so, we saw this in 2008. %$* 144
we're seeing it now. %$* 144
right. %$* 334
it is not surprise. %$* 144
also, you know, the foundation is his baby. %$* 144
he's incredibly defensive and proud of it. %$* 144
the problem is, i agree with errol that it's a complicated story to tell. %$* 144
the problem is, is there is a tremendous amount of defensiveness by the clintons about this. %$* 144
the campaign, you know, their officials sort of walked into this problem that existed before they got there. %$* 144
but if you look at the e- mails that were replaced, these were part of foia lawsuits. %$* 144
the state department under hillary clinton did not respond to freedom of information requests over several years. %$* 144
so, the timing of this is really almost entirely at their own hand in the sense that, if they had just released them at the time, this wouldn't be a big deal. %$* 144
you know, you can get into equivalent weights of the two campaigns on transparency, but -- and lack of equivalency. %$* 144
but these are legitimate questions to ask about a future president, especially one who is talking about the lack of transparency about her opponent. %$* 144
you were at the event. %$* 334
yes. %$* 207
how was it received? %$* 334
i think people reacted well to bill clinton himself, but the fact that he sort of went out of his way -- and remember, he wasn't even supposed to take that question. %$* 207
the music started playing and he insisted on taking a second question. %$* 207
when he got a question about a trust issue, he clearly became very frustrated. %$* 207
i mean, that really reflected the campaign's overall frustration and really wanting to move on from this issue. %$* 207
but i have to say, i don't think that secretary clinton in her response to the e-mail issues -- she hasn't always helped her own case, right? %$* 207
errol, you were talking about how the campaign needs to pivot away from the issue. %$* 207
that's correct. %$* 207
but her pivoting from this issue hasn't just been, look, i'm sorry, i made a mistake. %$* 207
let's move on. %$* 207
she has said at best, you know, misleading things about comey's testimony and at worse inaccurate things about comey's testimony. %$* 207
so, i think it's true this is a very complicated issue, but when she talks about these issues, she has to make sure that the way in which she cherry-picks her answers don't actually cause fresh questions of their own. %$* 207
we saw that specifically this week. %$* 334
guys, a lot more to come, including this -- hillary clinton releases her latest tax returns and says it is now donald trump's turn. %$* 334
what are the chances you think that's going to happen? %$* 334
the numbers and politics behind the move, that's next. %$* 334
hillary clinton has a challenge for donald trump. %$* 334
release your tax returns. %$* 334
the democratic candidate's taxes show the clintons made $10.6 million in 2015. %$* 334
that's significantly less than the $28 million they posted the year before. %$* 334
also revealed in the 2015 returns, their effective tax rate, 30.6 percent. %$* 334
let's be clear, candidates releasing tax returns as we well know is not a new practice. %$* 334
republicans and democrats vying for the white house have made them public for decades, for decades. %$* 334
before trump started his presidential bid, he had no issue with having people see his taxes. %$* 334
listen. %$* 334
would you release tax returns? %$* 473
i would release tax returns. %$* 5
how many years back would you go on the day you announce? %$* 473
three, five? %$* 473
i don't know. %$* 5
i mean, i actually have not even thought of that, but i would certainly show tax returns if it was necessary. %$* 5
i have no objection to certainly showing a tax return. %$* 5
but now there is that pesky irs audit allegedly getting in the way. %$* 334
at least donald trump says so. %$* 334
absolutely give my return, but i am being audited now for two or three years, so i can't do it until the audit is finished obviously. %$* 5
and i think people would understand that. %$* 5
except legally he's not bound to wait until the audit is over. %$* 334
we now heard that many, many times. %$* 334
but we're talking about it again because hillary clinton made the move and said she was going to release her 2015 tax returns, even though no one was asking her to release them. %$* 334
though we love transparency more than less -- more transparency than less. %$* 334
what did we -- what did we learn, errol? %$* 334
well, i think we learn that as -- in keeping with her past practices, it's a document that could be fairly called i think as somewhat political document. %$* 347
she didn't seek out tax breaks that she was clearly eligible for and almost nobody at that level of income -- $10 million is a whole lot of money, which she made while campaigning, by the way. %$* 347
she wasn't really doing very much work. %$* 347
she didn't buy farms. %$* 347
she didn't buy rental property. %$* 347
she didn't set herself up for passive income. %$* 347
she treated herself as a middle class taxpayer with a couple extra zeroes at the end of her income for the year. %$* 347
i think that's intended to sort of make her most like the rest of us. %$* 347
we remember four years ago -- %$* 347
more middle-classy. %$* 334
more middle-classy. %$* 347
i mean, we found out -- when we found out four years ago that mitt romney was paying an effective rate 14 percent because he got so much investment income, basically acting like a wealthy person, trying to take advantage of the breaks to which he is entitled, it didn't work so well for him politically. %$* 347
it didn't kill his campaign, but it didn't help his campaign. %$* 347
hillary clinton wants to help her campaign. %$* 347
sixty percent of their income came from speeches. %$* 334
that opens you up for another conversation about releasing the transcripts. %$* 334
they clearly think it's worth any risk of what they're putting out, maggie. %$* 334
they do. %$* 144
in fact, they were very concerned about going after donald trump on not releasing his tax returns themselves when the primaries were still going on because they didn't want to whip up the where are the transcripts -- %$* 144
haberman;  right, where's the transcripts, which bernie sanders' team was -- thank you -- it's early on a sunday morning. %$* 144
but they now feel like it is worth it to do that, and they think donald trump has enough self-inflicted wounds that it's a risk that's worth taking. %$* 144
i agree with errol that i think it is a political approach, i mean, on two levels. %$* 144
the way they went about going at their tax returns, and it's also a political approach to release it now while the e-mail issue is being discussed. %$* 144
what's striking to me is that, even if the speech's conversation comes up again, the campaign is basically laying out an offensive agenda against their rival every day. %$* 144
this is not what we are seeing the trump campaign doing still, and they could be. %$* 144
and mike pence, though, coming to the rescue for donald trump maybe. %$* 334
now, mike pence says he's possibly, likely, maybe yes, going to release his tax returns. %$* 334
here is what he said. %$* 334
listen. %$* 334
i believe we're completing those forms right now, as is appropriate under federal law and we'll be filing that. %$* 125
but i promise you, when my forms are filed and my tax returns are released, it's going to be a quick read, rita. %$* 125
so does that make up for everything? %$* 334
donald trump is not releasing his, but we've got mike pence's. %$* 334
yes. %$* 207
this is really what we should be talking about, right, like donald trump is getting pressure from clinton and kaine releasing their tax returns. %$* 207
but his own running mate is saying he is preparing to release his. %$* 207
i also talked to gary johnson over the weekend. %$* 207
he said he's happy to release them. %$* 207
no one has asked him. %$* 207
you go down the list of candidates. %$* 207
they're all okay with doing what you normally do when you run for office like this. %$* 207
donald trump is really holding out. %$* 207
and i think the more he does it and more the candidates around him say they're okay doing it raises questions about why he refuses to do so. %$* 207
to maggie's point, the clinton campaign thinks this is a winning issue and they'll pound on it non-stop from here on out. %$* 742
when we talk to the trump officials, they're feeling on this, at least as far as i've been told, is we've already baked in that trump probably pays close to zero in terms of his income tax rate, probably has limited charitable donations, may have questionable business ties in his taxes. %$* 742
so, why release them? %$* 742
why give you thousands -- why give reporters thousands of pages, why give the clinton campaign thousands of pages of potentially damaging stories when you can just hold on to them? %$* 742
they're not going to release the tax returns. %$* 742
there is no way. %$* 742
there is too much of an opportunity. %$* 742
we're engaged in a conversation, that's the only thing. %$* 334
no question about it, but then thousands of pages of story opportunities, of hit opportunities, of opposition opportunities, there is not a lot of benefit if you talk to the trump folks, in them ever releasing tax returns. %$* 742
i want to get you guys final take on this. %$* 334
big -- what could be the october surprise if we have one? %$* 334
but dccc now, guccifer 2.0, i just had to get that out there, releasing private e-mails, information, phone numbers of a lot of members and a lot of staffers, and they're all feeling the fallout. %$* 334
nancy pelosi said she was on a plane and landed to a score of sick e-mails and calls coming into her phone. %$* 334
democrats have got to be worried. %$* 334
republics should be worried too. %$* 334
republicans don't seem to be as much the targets of this. %$* 144
this seems to be pretty much, according to intelligence information, targeted toward democratic staffers, organizations, their personal e- mails and group e-mails. %$* 144
this is being done in such a way that it exists basically to destabilize, right, make voters not trust institutions and also create a climate of fear. %$* 144
there is a lot of concern among democrats about what is going to be released. %$* 144
you know, there was all sorts of damaging information. %$* 144
not actually politically damaging but personally, sort of embarrassing from the dnc leak. %$* 144
there will be a lot potentially of that and maybe more. %$* 144
yes, there is a lot more to come. %$* 334
all right, guys. %$* 334
our reporters give you a glimpse at tomorrow's headlines today, including donald trump looking at the election map and seeing red in a big state that's almost always blue. %$* 334
but, first, here are the results from our inside politics quiz. %$* 334
we asked, which candidate do you think would best handle the economy? %$* 334
most of you said hillary clinton. %$* 334
we'll be right back. %$* 334
let's head around the inside politics table now and ask our reporters to help you get ahead of the big political news in the week ahead. %$* 334
phil mattingly, first to you, my friend. %$* 334
so, there has been a lot of attention on, and right fully so, on the tv spin that we've seen. %$* 742
hillary clinton's campaign spent more than $15illion in the general election, donald trump's zero. %$* 742
but there are nuts and bolts infrastructure issues that a lot of republicans are very concerned about. %$* 742
he had a huge fund-raising month. %$* 742
where is that money going? %$* 742
so, i talked to a bunch of republican sources. %$* 742
they say, ground game, ground game, ground game. %$* 742
what does that mean? %$* 742
most interesting to me and most worrisome to gop officials, what their data operation looks like. %$* 742
donald trump didn't have a data operation in the primary. %$* 742
that was unheard of. %$* 742
the rnc does have a data operation. %$* 742
they spent more than $100 million building that over the course of the last four years. %$* 742
so, donald trump is going to take the rnc data operation. %$* 742
makes sense, right? %$* 742
except for that data operation was built for a generic gop voter set. %$* 742
a voter that donald trump doesn't necessarily need if he wants to win. %$* 742
he wants gop voters who are not traditional. %$* 742
marrying those two groups is extraordinarily difficult. %$* 742
the campaigns are putting a lot of effort into it. %$* 742
but i'm told there are a lot of issues outstanding. %$* 742
that rnc operation was meant to be melded into an existing campaign operation. %$* 742
that's not what's happening. %$* 742
they have a lot of ground to make up. %$* 742
the clinton campaign, they have been doing this for 14 months, %$* 742
millions of dollars. %$* 742
that's an area of major concern if this race is very close in november. %$* 742
i'd say, it's a major concern. %$* 334
so, it's ground game kind of in air quotes at this point. %$* 334
it kind of feels like. %$* 334
mj, how about you? %$* 334
the clinton campaign believes it is starting to see cracks in what is supposed to be donald trump's major selling point, and that, of course, is his business record. %$* 207
there was a new bloomberg poll out last week that showed 61 percent of likely voters say they're less impressed with donald trump's business past than they were at the beginning of the campaign. %$* 207
of course, you know, that the clinton campaign has been very relentless in going after donald trump post-convention, especially in going after his business practices like his ties being made in bangladesh. %$* 207
that was an ad that i saw in nevada over weekend, and if you look at her schedule in the coming weeks, she is going to pennsylvania with vice president joe biden, ohio. %$* 207
these are places where they especially want that kind of message to stick. %$* 207
yes, she is trolling him online and trolling him in real life, following him in various states. %$* 334
maggie, how about you? %$* 334
we spoke before about the republican concerns about what to do in terms of the down-ballot. %$* 144
there is some concern among republican officials about not just timing but the precedent. %$* 144
when everybody talks about the bob dole year, in 1996, when essentially it became the senate will be the check and balance so that we're not handing another clinton, bill clinton, you know, a blank line here. %$* 144
bob dole was a different case. %$* 144
he was friends with the then rnc chairman haley barbour and he himself was a senator. %$* 144
so, he had a different view of this. %$* 144
almost like with buy in. %$* 144
that's not what you're going to see this time, if you see it. %$* 144
the rnc is also still pretty dependent on donald trump in terms of fund- raising. %$* 144
and it is not clear exactly how that will work out once there is a split. %$* 144
the resources are linked together in a different way than they were in that year when there was still soft money. %$* 144
yes, nothing against reince priebus. %$* 334
was reince priebus signing those fundraising emails, different than having donald trump's name on those emails, we have seen already. %$* 334
errol, how about you? %$* 334
so, we've got donald trump saying over and over again he wants to put different states in play that haven't really been contested by republicans. %$* 347
the question is whether new york will be one of those states. %$* 347
now, we've had donald trump jr. at the convention saying we're going to make new york a swing state, we're going to play aggressively here. %$* 347
we have donald trump himself trying to get something on the schedule -- it was later canceled -- in upstate new york. %$* 347
it was an unusual choice. %$* 347
conventional wisdom dictates new york is out of reach. %$* 347
don't bother. %$* 347
on the other hand, down the ballot, we've got at least half a dozen congressional seats in new york that are actually in play. %$* 347
so this is not something that the rnc will write off. %$* 347
it's a question of whether or not donald trump and the rnc can get on the same page, truly try to put new york in play both for the congressional candidates and for the trump campaign. %$* 347
we'll be taking a look at that. %$* 347
how many blue states do you need to make swing states especially if you can't hold the red states? %$* 334
the map is an interesting. %$* 334
thanks, guys. %$* 334
thanks, guys. %$* 334
great to have you. %$* 334
thank you all so much. %$* 334
that's it for inside politics. %$* 334
again, thanks for sharing your morning with us. %$* 334
john king returns next sunday. %$* 334
up next, "state of the union" with jake tapper. %$* 334
have a good one. %$* 334

following breaking news here on cnn, 2 million people at the coast of florida, georgia and the carolinas being strongly urged to go somewhere safer. %$* 53
get out of the path of hurricane matthew, now a category 4 storm. %$* 53
right now, scientist flying inside the hurricane, are measuring winds of up to 140 miles an hour at 140 miles an hour, and right now, that hurricane beating down on the bahamas. %$* 53
city and police officials in daytona beach cannot make it any clear. %$* 53
get somewhere safe they say, warning this storm could be destructive and deadly on the katrina level. %$* 53
we have found people who said they've ridden out storms before they've been here 30 or 40 years. %$* 392
they don't want to leave their home. %$* 392
they don't want to leave their pets. %$* 392
they'll be fine. %$* 392
and, you know, i hope that the good lord looks out for them because we're not going to be able to. %$* 392
that's daytona beach earlier today. %$* 53
cnn's boris sanchez is right there. %$* 53
boris, the police chief, you've heard him there, when he says something like katrina level. %$* 53
we often see thrill seekers, we see people who want to go to the beach. %$* 53
we see people actually want to jump in the surf. %$* 53
are people listening to their police chief and their governor? %$* 53
for the most part, i would say yes, john. %$* 393
but even just a few moments ago, i would say about 20 minutes ago, there's a family that staying at this hotel. %$* 393
and i guess they've decided to stay. %$* 393
they told us this morning, they were indecisive as to whether or not they were going to take off or right up the storm here. %$* 393
they're from indianapolis. %$* 393
so i don't think they're used to this level of storm. %$* 393
it's a terrible, terrible idea. %$* 393
just a few moments ago, there were also kids running around with their families along this beach. %$* 393
as we're watching the waves get bigger and bigger and the wind gets stronger and stronger. %$* 393
we just had a band come through of harsh, harsh rain and wind that almost knocked us over as we were trying to set up for this live shot. %$* 393
i want to give you an idea. %$* 393
the tide keeps creeping up too. %$* 393
so, if you look at that line where the tide was just a few moments ago, we were standing there yesterday. %$* 393
and the beach was a couple hundred yards away. %$* 393
so obviously the water is creeping closer and closer as we get closer to hurricane matthew. %$* 393
we've actually been kicked out of our hotel. %$* 393
we've been told we have to evacuate, like many other businesses here in town. %$* 393
they are boarded up and set up with sandbags to make sure that they are at least safe, but it's simply isn't feasible, john, for people to stay out here during this hurricane. %$* 393
i would say that more than 2 million people right now are in evacuation zones. %$* 393
it's going to be the largest mandatory evacuation since hurricane sandy back in 2012. %$* 393
and people really should heed the warnings. %$* 393
governor rick scott not mincing any words saying that this storm will cause fatalities. %$* 393
you need to get out and do it as soon as possible before it's too late, john. %$* 393
if the water's come up that far and you still got probably 12 hours before this thing gets to you, that's a pretty -- that in and of itself, but some people thinks it's cool when they see that happens. %$* 53
boris, tells us about preparations. %$* 53
what are you seeing of either those who are getting out, who are taking care of their property before they go? %$* 53
or those who were trying to ride it out? %$* 53
but what preparations are they taking? %$* 53
well, as far as we've seen, there are quite a few people that have heeded the warnings. %$* 393
a lot of people have left town. %$* 393
yesterday, we were standing on this beach, there were crowds of people, there were kids building sand castles. %$* 393
today, obviously the beach is empty, say for the two families that i mentioned earlier. %$* 393
the good news is that this is an all hands on deck effort from officials. %$* 393
just a few miles from here, there's a command center set up at the daytona beach convention center. %$* 393
where i'm told there's several hundred police officers with escape vehicles or rather amphibious vehicles that are ready to help people escape their homes. %$* 393
the difficulty is -- and you heard that from the police chief. %$* 393
if people are staying are staying in their home once the hurricane really bears down on us. %$* 393
it's impossible for them to get to you. %$* 393
they're really at that point more of a recovery effort than a rescue effort. %$* 393
so, it's so important to get out while you still can. %$* 393
another bit of good news, they're expecting the power to go out. %$* 393
the good news is that florida power and light already has more than 2,500 workers stationed at the daytona motor speedway which was just about two miles down the road from here. %$* 393
so preparations are being made, but it's so crucial that people at home do their part and not cause more problems for those that are trying to help out. %$* 393
boris sanchez, live on the ground for us in daytona beach. %$* 53
boris, thank you. %$* 53
and please stay safe if things get worst in the hours ahead. %$* 53
still ahead, more coverage of hurricane matthew as it comes toward the united states and more politics. %$* 53
and a poll that could be very bad news for donald trump even though it has nothing to do with him. %$* 53
welcome back to our breaking news. %$* 53
probably you see the track of matthew there. %$* 53
i want to go directly to rick knabb. %$* 53
he's the director of the national hurricane center. %$* 53
rick, just tell us right up front. %$* 53
you hear people saying this could be a katrina-like storm. %$* 53
you hear the governor of florida saying this storm will kill you. %$* 53
is he exaggerating? %$* 53
not at all. %$* 394
if people don't evacuate where emergency managers have told them to leave. %$* 394
they could be putting themselves at great risk of losing their lives. %$* 394
whether it is in coastal areas due to storm surge or anywhere on land where you're in a mobile home or other structure where the extreme winds of a major hurricane would make you extremely vulnerable. %$* 394
so, you know we need to heed the evacuation instructions of local officials. %$* 394
if we're going to save the lives as much as we can as this a major hurricane comes to florida. %$* 394
and as we speak at this moment, tell us what the latest is on when you expect landfall. %$* 53
and how strong of a storm you expect it to be when that happens? %$* 53
well, we don't know for sure where or when or even if the center of the hurricane will actually come on shore in florida. %$* 394
but even if the center stays just off shore, you still bring the hurricane force winds on to the coast in inland areas. %$* 394
tropical storm force winds even further inland in that. %$* 394
you're still going to have the storm surge that needs evacuation to happen in order to save lives. %$* 394
and you're still going to have the heavy rainfall and inland flooding. %$* 394
you know, nine out of 10 people, historically that have died in u.s. land falling tropical systems have died as the result of water. %$* 394
so, we have to respects all of the hazards and not focus too much on where the center goes because regardless, this is an extremely dangerous situation. %$* 394
and just lastly rick, what is unique about matthew? %$* 53
you track all these storms, but each one has its own finger print, its own signature. %$* 53
what's unique about matthew? %$* 53
i think the unique factor is this awful track that is going to affect so many large population centers in multiple states. %$* 394
just think about what the storm surge flooding could do potentially in jacksonville, florida, and in the st. johns river. %$* 394
all the people evacuating in georgia and south carolina, they need to do that because there's huge population areas on the coast there that could experience storm surge, major hurricane force winds. %$* 394
i mean, this could be, not only a very expensive storm but a very deadly one if people don't evacuate when they're told to do so and find a safe place to be during the height of the storm. %$* 394
conditions going downhill in south florida this afternoon and you've got to get done with your preps in central and north florida tonight because tomorrow morning it's going to go downhill quickly. %$* 394
excellent advice from rick knabb, the director of the national hurricane center. %$* 53
rick, really appreciate your time on this very, very busy day for you. %$* 53
thanks so much. %$* 53
let's move quickly to politics now. %$* 53
and another very troubling poll number for donald trump today. %$* 53
and it isn't about hillary clinton. %$* 53
it isn't about donald trump. %$* 53
and it's not for a battle ground state. %$* 53
our new cnn orc poll shows president obama at the highest political standing of his second term, a 55 percent approval rating heading into the final month of the race to succeed him. %$* 53
now, we know it's personal for the president. %$* 53
now we have fresh evidence he has enormous political capital as he continues to make this case against donald trump. %$* 53
i just want to emphasize the degree to which we are in serious times and this is a really serious job. %$* 40
this is not entertainment. %$* 40
this is not a reality show. %$* 40
just listen to what mr. trump has to say and make your own judgment with respect to how confident you feel about his ability to manage things like our nuclear triad. %$* 40
i don't think the guy is qualified to be president of the united states. %$* 40
one candidate's family foundation has saved countless lives around the world. %$* 40
the other candidate's foundation took money. %$* 40
other people gave to his charity, and then bought a six-foot tall painting of himself. %$* 40
an incumbent president at 55 percent heading into the final month of the campaign to succeed him is great news. %$* 53
so let's have the conversation, if during and we can put up on the screen past presidential approval rate to hit these president's at 55. %$* 53
john mccain had george w. bush at 27 percent, when he was trying to win in 08. %$* 53
good luck with that. %$* 53
double zero, 2000, that's a bit of an anomaly because president clinton was very strong, how gorgeous would have anything to do with him. %$* 53
and ronald reagan, that the last time in our lifetime that a sitting vice president -- or in the past -- the current party has kept the white house, kept the white house, and that's what you have here, was that one right there. %$* 53
and i'd say, how important is the obama factor? %$* 53
it's probably been the best gift that president obama could give hillary clinton. %$* 204
i mean that is probably the best gift she could get right now. %$* 204
so, it will help her when she's campaigning in places like philadelphia and miami. %$* 204
probably a pretty strong factor. %$* 204
he's improving with independents and with blacks and hispanics and that's where she needs help as well. %$* 204
yeah, and if you look at those numbers in particular. %$* 146
he's still very popular with democratic voters, with liberals, with progressives, younger voters. %$* 146
people who actually are -- hillary clinton is having a hard time winning over particularly more liberal voters and younger voters. %$* 146
that's why he is a key surrogate. %$* 146
the one thing though that you look at those numbers. %$* 146
he's still very unpopular with republicans. %$* 146
so, you know, he has not improved a whole lot among republican voters. %$* 146
so if she wants to use him to win those swing voters or win over republicans who might be disaffected by trump. %$* 146
he's not the most effective weapon on that front. %$* 146
can i say one thing, that number challenges a core assumption that i think everyone has about this election, that this is a change election, right? %$* 288
the whole arguments of the trump campaign, the only way he's going to win, is if it really is a change election. %$* 288
well, 55 percent of the country is saying that they approve of the eight-year incumbent. %$* 288
that really challenges that. %$* 288
now other people will say, "well if you look at the wrong track number, it's a two third of 60 to 70 percent." %$* 288
but a lot of those are democrats who are saying, "well, i want, you know, i want something more liberal than obama." %$* 288
so i think it shows the hurdle that trump has in this election in making it a true change election. %$* 288
a popular president to your point ... %$* 53
about change election. %$* 288
is that 2008, when george w. bush, is at 25 percent. %$* 288
yeah. %$* 173
and those wrong track -- right track numbers have been going against this president. %$* 173
i think for the duration of his time, are the majority people who have thought it was on a wrong try. %$* 173
but he obviously got reelected in 2004. %$* 173
so he'll be enormously helpful but not only with the obama coalition that we typically think of a young folks after americans and latinos. %$* 173
but also white people. %$* 173
i mean, remember, the first place he was supposed to go was wisconsin. %$* 173
not a ton of black people there. %$* 173
he's enormously popular i think with the college educated, white voters, suburban and white women. %$* 173
so, he'll be useful there, i think he benefits in some ways from the contrast. %$* 173
you know, with trump. %$* 173
and also, he's not really under the kind of scrutiny any more, right? %$* 173
catching with hillary clinton as well. %$* 53
yeah. %$* 173
yeah, both of these nominees are unpopular, they look at president obama's, you know ... %$* 53
he's a little above the fray. %$* 288
so people had a little bit more positive view of him. %$* 288
he's not under attack on the daily basis. %$* 288
yeah, obviously, he's off the road. %$* 53
he's dealing with hurricane he said some other things that affected his -- have affected his schedule. %$* 53
but if he gets on the road campaign that again move to the frame, we'll see up to your point, and he is not by return of voters in the midterm elections for him, we'll see if he can do it in the general election as we prepare for the next big event which is sunday night, you cannot overstate the importance, especially for donald trump. %$* 53
you know the trajectory of the polling and then state by state battlegrounds in recent days. %$* 53
the two candidates will do debate prep. %$* 53
donald trump has a town hall tonight. %$* 53
hillary clinton's off the trail. %$* 53
some people think that's a little risky but she thinks it's the best way to do, is to go off the trail and prepare. %$* 53
listen here, two very different takes from the two nominees on how the vice presidential debate played out. %$* 53
when your own running mate won't defend the top of the ticket, i think that tells you everything you need to know. %$* 149
about whose qualified and temperamentally fit to be president. %$* 149
even mike pence doesn't think donald trump is. %$* 149
how many of you watched the vice presidential debate last night? %$* 5
mike pence did an incredible job. %$* 5
and i'm getting a lot of credit because that's really my first so-called choice. %$* 5
that was my first hire as we would say in las vegas. %$* 5
yeah, clearly listening to kayleigh mcenany and corey lewandowski who made that very point on our air, giving him credit and of course ... %$* 173
so some people are giving him credit. %$* 53
henderson: yeah, so yeah, some people are. %$* 53
pass the fact check. %$* 53
yeah, i mean clever that he's able to turn it back to himself. %$* 173
mike pence's performance, to make it about him and, you know, kind of typical of what donald trump ... %$* 173
how much will -- i tell you'll be fascinating to see how much he'll ultimately decide not to fight point by point when hillary clinton brings up his comments about mexican immigrants or george sorial or african-americans, women issues, he decided in the last debate to fight all those issues, push back and every time. %$* 146
mike pence did not and that's one reason why he did a lot better. %$* 146
maybe he didn't defend donald trump completely, but he didn't feel the need to do that just to counter punch instead how much will donald trump heed those lessons. %$* 146
that's may be the big question. %$* 146
do you see her turning to him in the town hall, so did it bother you mr. trump that mike pence didn't defend it when you called mexican's criminals and rapist? %$* 53
may, but i think this v.p. %$* 288
debate is going to serve in the rear view here, i think he does have a legitimate point there, this was the first most important decision of his campaign and he was down to christie, gingrich and pence. %$* 288
of those three, he chose the most sort of responsible of the three. %$* 288
christie is right now mired in a scandal in new jersey still. %$* 288
gingrich is sort of, you know valuable personality. %$* 288
so i think he got to get some credit for trumps choice there in terms of doing something that was a little out of hit and character thing that someone that's not like him. %$* 288
you want to talk about humility, pence this morning in an interview on "fox news" gave the credit to donald trump and said, listen, it was donald trump's vision that helped carry me through this vice presidential debate. %$* 204
so, you know, some people are seeing that humility from him. %$* 204
pence has figured it out. %$* 53
yeah. %$* 173
with whom he shares the ticket. %$* 53
that's just pretty exciting, but what place will at the home office. %$* 53
coming up, hurricane matthew is barreling towards the east coast. %$* 53
we'll bring you the latest soon live we'll take you to one of the communities that's unfortunately preparing for the worst. %$* 53
welcome back. %$* 53
hurricane matthew now, punishing the bahamas and also left the trail of devastation across the caribbean, especially in haiti. %$* 53
where cnn has just learned the death toll now stands at 108. %$* 53
the storm now of course, headed straight towards the united states. %$* 53
live pictures here from hollywood, florida. %$* 53
florida residents have been told to prepare for the worst and told to expect the direct hit from the storm. %$* 53
state of emergency has been declared for florida, georgia and south carolina. %$* 53
more than 2 million residents have been asked to leave their homes in those three states. %$* 53
cnn correspondent brian dodd -- brian todd excuse me, is live in folly beach south carolina that's near charleston. %$* 53
now brian, everyone is saying it's going to hit florida first and sometimes the psychologist sets in, in the states that are coming later or we can just wait and see what happens. %$* 53
what's the situation there now? %$* 53
well, john they are kind of waiting and seeing what happens here. %$* 381
and a lot of people here are used to hurricanes. %$* 381
they've lived through hurricane hugo in 1989 and some other major storms. %$* 381
so they want to -- a lot of them want to stay, and as you say, and the psychology gets into play, they want to kind of see what goes on here, because a lot of them do not want to leave their homes right away. %$* 381
this is folly beach, it's a barrier island, it's one of the islands that protects charleston from some of the major storms and sometimes it doesn't protect charleston if the storm is large enough. %$* 381
you see some of the waves crushing behind me and these are under normal circumstances. %$* 381
we're expecting 4 to 8 feet of storm surge when the storm hits in about 36 hours. %$* 381
and here is the problem here on folly island. %$* 381
you can see down here the storm surge is clearly going to come up this way. %$* 381
the dunes are very low lying. %$* 381
not really very high. %$* 381
not offering much protection at all from these buildings or from the street which is about the same level as we are right beyond this. %$* 381
local officials telling us they do expect the storm surge to actually, you know, just carry the water into the street. %$* 381
this area had a lot of flooding last year when there was just a lot of rain and it wasn't a hurricane, about a year ago, when there was a fairly significant storm here. %$* 381
we're expecting about 8 to 12 inches of rain according to local officials here. %$* 381
so again flooding in these low-lying areas along these barrier islands is going to be a major issue, john. %$* 381
and we have to talk a little bit about evacuations. %$* 381
you talked about that when you tossed to me a second ago. %$* 381
short time ago, governor nikki haley said only about 175,000 people in this area of south carolina have evacuated. %$* 381
and in her words that is just not enough. %$* 381
they want more than 200,000 others to evacuate. %$* 381
they don't call it mandatory. %$* 381
but they do say you've got to leave and if you don't leave, basically you're doing that at your own risk. %$* 381
and they've ordered people in the charleston the beaufort areas, ory and georgetown counties to leave. %$* 381
but again they don't call it mandatory, they're saying we really, really want you to go. %$* 381
but if you stay you're really at your own risk. %$* 381
and they say if you stay, you're also putting the first responders at risk when they have to try to come and help you out if something happens. %$* 381
so that's the message that they're getting across. %$* 381
they're worried that people at least in this area may not yet be taking this seriously enough, john. %$* 381
brian todd for us in folly beach south carolina. %$* 53
brian, thank you. %$* 53
and it just emphasize the point, the president of the united states, the governors of these states, the director of the federal emergency management agency, the director of the national hurricane center all being quite consistent. %$* 53
sometimes you get conflicting signals. %$* 53
not here. %$* 53
this storm is dangerous. %$* 53
listen to your local officials. %$* 53
thanks for joining us here "inside politics," back at noon tomorrow. %$* 53
wolf keeps up our coverage right after this. %$* 53

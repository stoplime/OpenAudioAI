new blasts cause fear and panic in london -- transit systems struck again. %$* 116
the bloodshed is minimal but the message seems clear... %$* 116
they have the desire to use their terrorist techniques to frighten us. %$* 161
riding the rails:  is congress getting anywhere with efforts to step up mass transit security? %$* 116
key senators get face time with supreme court nominee john roberts. %$* 901
are democrats as open-minded as they seem? %$* 901
people need to just relax and let the process go forward. %$* 298
the abortion question: should judge roberts answer it? %$* 116
americans deliver a verdict on the confirmation debate ahead. %$* 116
now live from washington, cnn's inside politics. %$* 116
thank you for joining us, i'm candy crowley. %$* 164
london police say even if some of the explosives did not go off, the latest attacks on the city's transit system had been intended to kill, luckily they did not. %$* 164
at last report only one person was injured in the blast -- or attempted blast -- near three underground stations and on a double-decker bus. %$* 164
police say forensic evidence found at the crime scenes could provide a, quote, "significant break" in their hunt for suspects. %$* 164
for londoners, it was a frightening flashback to two weeks ago that killed 56 people, including 4 suicide bombers. %$* 164
british prime minister tony blair says authorities are fairly clear how today's explosions unfolded. %$* 164
we can't minimize instances such as this, because they obviously have been serious in the four different places as we know. %$* 756
i think all i'd like to say it this -- that we know by these things -- they're done to scare people and frighten them and make them anxious and worried. %$* 756
here in the united states, transit systems remain on high alert as they have been since the july 7 attacks in london. %$* 164
new york city authorities say they will begin conducting random searches of the bags and backpacks of commuters on the city's transportation system. %$* 164
and officials say the pentagon stepped internal security today in response to the blasts in london. %$* 164
president bush was briefed on the incidents overseas and spoke out yet again about the terror threat. %$* 164
and that's why we want to go to cnn's elaine quijano with at the white house -- elaine. %$* 164
hello to you, candy. %$* 478
president bush first learned about what was happening in london at the end of his daily intelligence briefing. %$* 478
now, we understand that he was briefed by his chief of staff, andy card, as well as the national security adviser, steven hadley. %$* 478
now, the president, we are told, after making some remarks here in washington, primarily focusing on cafta, the central american free- trade agreement, we're told the president received yet another update, this time not only from chief of staff andrew card, but also from his homeland security adviser, fran townsend, and that update included the remarks made by british prime minister tony blair. %$* 478
now in his speech today, the president did not refer specifically to these latest incidents, but instead he reiterated his position that the u.s. and its allies will prevail over terrorists. %$* 478
they have territorial designs. %$* 161
they have the desire to use their terrorist techniques to frighten us. %$* 161
in other words, they understand when they kill in cold blood it ends up on our tv screens. %$* 161
and they are trying to shake our will. %$* 161
and they're trying to create vacuums into which their ideology can move. %$* 161
they don't understand our country, though. %$* 161
they don't understand when it comes to the defense of universal freedoms, this country won't be frightened. %$* 161
now, in addition to fighting the war on terror, administration officials say that they are also making progress on the diplomat front as well. %$* 478
and on that front, karen hughes, a familiar face to the bush administration, is set to be going before the senate foreign relations committee sometime soon. %$* 478
thanks so much elaine quijano at the white house. %$* 902
we want to now bring in cnn security analyst, richard falkenrath, a former homeland security adviser to the white house. %$* 902
richard, thanks for being here. %$* 902
two attacks against the same basic target in two weeks. %$* 902
i am trying to imagine had there been another attack in the u.s. two weeks after 9/11. %$* 902
what questions does this bring to your mind? %$* 902
well, the number question is how could this happen? %$* 903
this has been a bad two weeks for tony blair and his team. %$* 903
they had a plot that resulted in 56 deaths two weeks ago. %$* 903
it's possible that some of the individuals involved in that were implicated in previous terrorist conspiracies that were successfully stopped. %$* 903
and if that turns out to be true, that is a devastating blow to tony blair's counter terrorism effort at home. %$* 903
and what of -- these being at the same targets -- i mean, we couldn't even get on a plane for a while in the u.s. after 9/11. %$* 164
it was a smaller, but a significant blast from two weeks ago. %$* 164
this was scary. %$* 164
what about what they have done in the mean time. %$* 164
do you have any questions about that? %$* 164
well, i mean, this is a blow to the confidence of the british people and the security at home. %$* 903
even though they probably dodged a bullet in terms of fatalities, to be able to carry out a simultaneous attack at rush hour in the evening -- in the morning, three subways, one bus, shows it's so similar that the british people, i think, are going to be very, very concerned now about the ability to prevent future such attacks. %$* 903
one of the questions that came up with prime minister tony blair that was asked to him was, do you think these attacks are because you are in iraq? %$* 164
is there any evidence to suggest that these attacks basically would not have happened had britain not been in iraq? %$* 164
to my knowledge there's not any such evidence in britain. %$* 903
but there is this debate raging in london right now, was triggered by a couple of academics writing a report that got a lot of attention. %$* 903
the attacks on -- two weeks ago were carried out by pakistanis, not arabs. %$* 903
they weren't associated really with anything going on in iraq. %$* 903
they were associated with what's going on in pakistan. %$* 903
and there has been a long-standing problem with pakistani-based militants internationally waging terrorist that predates the invasion of iraq. %$* 903
so, to my knowledge, there's not yet any evidence of this. %$* 903
but it is becoming a political issue for tony blair in london. %$* 903
and talk to me just a little bit about forensics. %$* 164
when they say, oh we have these bombs, apparently, did not explode -- or whatever they had did not explode. %$* 164
what do you learn from that? %$* 164
well, it's going to be a much easier forensic task today than it was two weeks ago in london, because they didn't have huge detonations, and they don't have a lot of dead bodies to deal with, as well. %$* 903
and so they're going to be able to learn much quicker, i suspect, the nature of this attack. %$* 903
indeed the prime minister suggested that in his remarks. %$* 903
he said we already have a fairly good idea of what happened. %$* 903
he wasn't saying that at this time two weeks ago. %$* 903
and so if, it in fact, was partially exploded or unexploded bombs, and the fact that they didn't go off, will tell the police a lot more than what they had previously where it was a burned out rail car. %$* 903
bringing this home a bit, this will undoubtedly bring up the question of should we be protecting our mass transit more carefully? %$* 164
it was a big debate two weeks ago after that attack. %$* 164
let me broaden it to just say in homeland security, when these discussions are had within the people who are in a position to put money in different places, how do you weigh that? %$* 164
i mean, is this about how many people get killed, let's protect that? %$* 164
or is it about where could be the worst disruption? %$* 164
how do you measure? %$* 164
well, the first thing that you measure is what does the law say you have to do? %$* 903
if you look at where we've spent money since 9/11, it's really where the law forced us to do it. %$* 903
and so we had a really strong statutory mandate to spend money at u.s. airports, now over $20 billion. %$* 903
there is no law saying the federal government has to take over, or really contribute hugely to mass transit security. %$* 903
so then the question is where you have discretionary money, how do you spend it? %$* 903
and there's really two schools of thought. %$* 903
one school says spend it where whatever seems the most likely to happen. %$* 903
and the other school is spend it against catastrophic threats, things which, even if they've never happened before, or are very difficult to carry out, could result in thousands of dead people. %$* 903
and secretary chertoff has really been very strong voiced in that latter camp for spending against catastrophic threats. %$* 903
he's taking some heat for it. %$* 903
it's a risky position for a political figure to do that. %$* 903
but i happen to believe it's the right approach. %$* 903
mr. falkenrath, thank you so much, appreciate it. %$* 164
on capitol hill, supreme court nominee john roberts is making the rounds for a second day. %$* 164
up next, what kind of impression is the judge making on senators who will decide his fate? %$* 164
we will have a live report from capitol hill. %$* 164
plus, we will check in with a member of the so-called "gang of 14,"  democrat mary landrieu, is the gang unified in its response to roberts? %$* 164
and later, the karl rove cia story and a memo reportedly marked s for secret. %$* 164
president bush is taking advantage of every opportunity to tout his new supreme court nominee. %$* 164
he even worked praise of judge john roberts into a speech about trade to the organization of american states. %$* 164
mr. bush says he appreciates the reception roberts is getting so far in the senate. %$* 164
he is a person that will make all americans proud to be a member of the supreme court. %$* 161
he is a -- he's got the experience, wisdom, fairness and civility to be a really good judge. %$* 161
he has a profound respect for the rule of law. %$* 161
he respects the liberties guaranteed in our constitution to all americans; from people of all walks of life. %$* 161
he'll strictly apply the constitution. %$* 161
he's not going to legislate from the bench. %$* 161
as for roberts himself, he's been busy again today meeting and greeting senators. %$* 164
he was today with senator schumer, who you see right there. %$* 164
sen. schumer is one of those who is holding his opinion until he gets a chance to question the nominee. %$* 164
we want to bring in now our congressional correspondent, ed henry, about the reception that the judge has been getting on capitol hill --ed? %$* 164
well good afternoon, candy. %$* 308
in fact, judge roberts is meeting down the hallway with senator kennedy right now -- just down the hallway from me. %$* 308
this is day two of the charm offensive on the hill and it's going extremely well. %$* 308
he started the day at home. %$* 308
he got a kiss from his wife before he left for the hill and i can tell you the affection here on the hill is about just as strong. %$* 308
he, first of all, got a lot of praise from the "gang of 14" moderates that averted that nuclear showdown last month over lower court judges. %$* 308
they came out of their first meeting about the nomination today, singing his praises, saying it's unlikely at this point that there could be a filibuster. %$* 308
also, praise from key members of the judiciary committee, including republican orin hatch, who is basically almost fitting judge roberts for the black robes of the supreme court, saying that he's going to make a fine justice on the high court. %$* 308
this is a nominee that would not fall into the filibuster category. %$* 750
this follows yesterday when three key members of the gang of 14, john warner, john mccain and ben nelson, all said they believe it's unlikely there'll be a filibuster. %$* 750
there's so much momentum, in fact and so much praise being dished out, that two top lawmakers, republican john warner, who, again, praised the judge yesterday and the democratic leader harry reid, today both reminded their colleagues that they've got to take the advise and consent part of the constitution seriously. %$* 750
they don't want to get ahead of themselves and prejudge the nomination. %$* 750
this is a very important confirmation process, not a coronation. %$* 841
cool your jets. %$* 298
let the process go forward. %$* 298
having said that, both warner and reid had more praise today for the judge. %$* 308
in fact, senator reid said that, quote, "nobody sees extraordinary circumstances at this point that would lead to a filibuster." %$* 308
but the key there, senator reid said, "at this point." %$* 308
that caveat is important. %$* 308
again, nobody wants to prejudge it. %$* 308
the confirmation hearings won't kick off until the fall, but another good sign for judge roberts came from a key moderate republican, susan collins of maine, who supports abortion rights and after this "gang of 14" meeting, seemed to say that she was satisfied with the answer that judge roberts gave on the abortion question when he was quarried two years ago over a lower court nomination. %$* 308
he also said that there was nothing in his personal beliefs that would prevent him from fully and faithfully applying that decision. %$* 664
now, obviously the supreme court has the ability to overturn its precedence, but i'm looking for a justice who will respect precedence. %$* 664
the supreme court does not ignore precedence and i am heartened by what judge roberts said. %$* 664
it's interesting that judge roberts actually may take more flack from conservatives than moderate republicans on the issue of abortion. %$* 308
conservative senator sam brownback of kansas was quoted in the "kansas city star" today as saying that he has some concerns that the judge -- judge roberts has not been clear enough about his position on abortion, saying quote, "if someone is not well articulated on a position, the tendency is to move left on the bench." %$* 308
senator brownback saying he has in mind justice david souter, who has, in the eyes of conservatives, gone a little bit left on the high court -- candy? %$* 308
ed henry on capitol hill. %$* 164
thanks, ed. %$* 164
i'll discuss the john roberts nomination with democratic senator mary landrieu, one of the so-called "gang of 14," next. %$* 164
and also an update on today's terror attacks on the london transit system exactly two weeks after the deadly bombings on similar targets. %$* 164
before we resume our political coverage, a quick update on today's attempted bombings in london. %$* 164
british police are gathering evidence at this hour after attackers tried to detonate explosive devices on a double-decker bus and near three subway stations. %$* 164
unconfirmed reports say one person was injured. %$* 164
today's attacks follow the much more powerful and deadly blasts in london exactly two weeks ago. %$* 164
we will have another update on the situation in london at the top of the hour. %$* 164
returning now to our coverage of the john roberts supreme court nomination, i am joined from capitol hill by senator mary landrieu, a democrat from louisiana and a member of the "gang of 14," although i don't think there are any cards or anything. %$* 164
you're just a member of the gang, right? %$* 164
just a member of this group, candy and i hope we're making some progress, you know, keeping the senate on track and working and senators talking to each other, so we'll see. %$* 875
but you pretty much decided, it seems to me, in a meeting you had this morning, that this is not a filibuster-worthy gentleman, this nominee. %$* 164
well, what i can say at this time is that the process has begun smoothly. %$* 875
and that's what many of us in our group and many senators were hoping for, a nominee that could help unite the country. %$* 875
but the process has just started, and i think pre-judging or pre- guessing anything today is really premature. %$* 875
the first indications are good. %$* 875
but, you know, this is to the highest court in the land, candy. %$* 875
people in the country are looking for someone of great intelligence, i think, objectivity, a sense of fairness, someone that will take each case and the evidence as it comes and make the best decisions on behalf of the nation. %$* 875
and, you know, the verdict is still out. %$* 875
the process has just begun, so i would -- while things are off to a smooth start, it's the beginning, not the end of this process. %$* 875
accepting that it's just begun, do you see anything so far that troubles you? %$* 164
no, at this point, but let me be quick to say that the committee hearings haven't even started. %$* 875
and the judiciary committee has a very serious role to play. %$* 875
and that will be required of republican and democrat members of the committee. %$* 875
the rounds have just started with personal meetings of some of the key members. %$* 875
we, the committee, or the "gang of 14" is not the judiciary committee and don't hold ourselves out to be. %$* 875
we're a group that's just trying to keep senators talking, to keep the work of the senate moving forward. %$* 875
and so far, we think we've contributed in that way. %$* 875
seems to me that one point of contention so far has been what sorts of questions are appropriate to ask this nominee. %$* 164
let us take -- and first of all, let's say that we know there are many other issues other than abortion. %$* 164
that's a hot button issue, though. %$* 164
and the question is here, do you think you can point blank say to judge roberts, do you believe in a woman's right to abortion? %$* 164
well, there will be many, many questions answered of this nominee, or asked of this nominee on the and through the committee process. %$* 875
i think what is important is to ask him about his general views, questions about what he has done in the past, opinions that, perhaps, he has written, maybe not representing clients, but as a staffer, to get -- ascertain some of his views. %$* 875
but the most important thing, candy, i think, is does he have the intelligence? %$* 875
does he have the experience? %$* 875
does he have the kind of personality that would lead us to believe that when he's presented with evidence he can make a fair decision based on the constitution and the law? %$* 875
so there'll be many questions, but again, the process is just started. %$* 875
let me try that again. %$* 164
i'm just trying to get a sense of whether you think it's appropriate to ask the judge his personal views on abortion and how he might rule on existing cases? %$* 164
well, i think many members of the committee will ask him in many different ways about that issue. %$* 875
as i have said on many different programs, i think the american people generally support some restrictions on a process, that they find many people immoral. %$* 875
but they don't want to criminalize it. %$* 875
they don't want to put women in jail, they don't want to interfere in people's personal decisions. %$* 875
so this issue will be -- continue to be talked about, probably on the supreme court level, but also here in congress and in many state houses across the country. %$* 875
just, lastly, i want to ask you real quick -- and we have less than 30 seconds -- are you disappointed that the president did not name a woman? %$* 164
well, you know, it would have been nice. %$* 875
i mean, we've only had two women out of 108 who have ever served on the supreme court. %$* 875
and i'm not taking anything away from this nominee who has been really extraordinary in his level of experience. %$* 875
but there are many,, many qualified women in this country, so let's hope that we'll keep that idea in mind and as the president considers, perhaps, additional appointments, i think that would send a very positive signal that women provide great leadership in this nation. %$* 875
as well as african-americans, latinos, hispanics, who have not represented in their right numbers in places of leadership. %$* 875
senator mary landrieu, appreciate so much your time. %$* 164
some lawmakers have been waving red flags about rail security in the united states, concerns fueled again today by the latest attacks on london's transit system. %$* 164
coming up, is washington doing enough to protect commuters? %$* 164
plus, senators may be withholding judgment on president bush's supreme court nominee, but many americans are forming opinions about john roberts. %$* 164
more inside politics ahead. %$* 164
as the markets get set to close on wall street, i am joined by christine romans in new york, with the dobbs report. %$* 164
christine? %$* 164
candy, you're stuck with me -- kitty pilgrim. %$* 315
right now, dow industrials -- let's take a look -- down about 60 points; nasdaq, half a percent lower. %$* 444
delta posted a $304 million loss, that was hurt by high fuel costs. %$* 904
the "wall street journal" reports that some executives believe that the company may not be able to avoid filing for bankruptcy. %$* 904
and at united, the machinists' union has ratified a four-and-a-half year contract, as it works to get out of chapter 11. %$* 904
in other news, china has bowed to international pressure to revalue its currency. %$* 904
it will be pegged to a basket of international currencies and some in congress were threatening sanctions if china did not act. %$* 904
many blamed the artificially low rate of the chinese currency on the soaring trade deficit china. %$* 904
well, i think they've been caution and i think admirably so. %$* 905
but i look at it as the first step in a number of further adjustments as they invariably increase their participation in the world trading markets. %$* 905
and so, i think it's a good start. %$* 905
now, the move will allow the currency to float a bit more freely to help u.s. exporters. %$* 315
however, american consumers could end up paying more for chinese-made clothes and electronics. %$* 315
coming up 6 p.m. eastern on "lou dobbs tonight,"  we'll have more on china's currency changes. %$* 315
treasury secretary john snow will be our guest. %$* 315
also chairwoman of the senate homeland security committee, susan collins, will join us to discuss the london terror attacks. %$* 315
00 p.m., on "lou dobbs tonight." %$* 906
but for now, back to candy. %$* 906
kitty pilgrim, we are never stuck with you. %$* 164
always a pleasure. %$* 164
thanks. %$* 164
thanks, candy. %$* 315
now back to inside politics. %$* 164
two subway lines in london remain closed and commuters still are on edge after a new series of explosions and attempted explosions on the city's transit system. %$* 164
only one person was reported injured. %$* 164
a stark contrast to the bloodshed in the london bombings two weeks ago. %$* 164
in response to the attacks, british police are calling today for sweeping new powers, including holding terrorism suspects for up to three months without charge. %$* 164
this new wave of fear in london is hitting many commuters in this country where they live -- at least where they commute and some are worried that officials in washington are not doing enough to protect mass transit systems. %$* 164
we are joined now by congressman peter king, republican of new york and a member of the homeland security committee. %$* 164
congressman king, first of all, thank you so much for being here. %$* 164
thank you, candy. %$* 53
your fellow congregation member, senator schumer, has said the $200 million that homeland security wants to direct toward rail and public transit is not enough and you need more. %$* 164
i am assuming since you are from new york, you agree. %$* 164
yes, i do. %$* 53
i can't tell you what the exact amount should be. %$* 53
the first thing we should do is put the $50 million back in which the senate took out. %$* 53
the house appropriated $150 million. %$* 53
the senate cut that to $100 million. %$* 53
that's wrong. %$* 53
so that $50 million should go right back in. %$* 53
also secretary chertoff is due very soon to -- actually is overdue to give us a report on his plan for mass transit. %$* 53
and i think that plan should indicate where more money should go. %$* 53
also, though, the london bombings today showed us that we just don't deal with mass transit attacks by putting in money. %$* 53
also, for instance, i believe that we strongly need the patriot act to be renewed. %$* 53
just as in britain now they're looking for additional security legislation, we should, at the very least, extend the patriot act here in this country. %$* 53
as far as the overall issue, secretary chertoff, he did, though, when he submitted his original budget, he asked for $600 million for transportation infrastructure protection and he wanted to have the right to determine whether the money should go to port security, to rail security, exactly what type of mass transit. %$* 53
congress didn't give him that right. %$* 53
i think we should look again at that to put more money in and let the secretary decide depending on what the threat is. %$* 53
because, you know, rail security, obviously, we're very concerned about that. %$* 53
next week, it could be port security. %$* 53
there could be an attack on department stores, on shopping centers. %$* 53
so i think the secretary should have more flexibility. %$* 53
i guess the question then is:  is that something that you could explain to new york constituents who do ride the subway every day and are watching this? %$* 164
secretary chertoff, as you mentioned, said a couple of weeks ago, "look, a plane can be used as a bomb and can kill 3,000 people and in the subway, maybe 30 or 40 are killed. %$* 164
we have to go where the biggest danger is." %$* 164
do you agree with that? %$* 164
is that something that you can sell in a state and certainly in a city, new york city, where there are so many public transit commuters? %$* 164
i think secretary chertoff could have used a more felicitous choice of words. %$* 53
i think what he was trying to say, what he meant to say was that we do have to prioritize. %$* 53
and we always are going to spend more money always on airport security because, first of all, we have to have federal screeners at the airport just by the nature of the damage that could be caused. %$* 53
but at the same time, listen, there could be terrible disasters. %$* 53
if you had a bomb go off in a new york city subway tunnel, you could end up killing hundreds if not thousands of people. %$* 53
so while we won't be spending as much money on rail as we will on air, nevertheless, i think it is fair to say that certainly, as this goes along, we are going to have to increase for rail. %$* 53
but, again, there's more than $200 million, even $100 million. %$* 53
because there's hundreds of millions, for instance, in new york now waiting to be spent just on strengthening the tunnels under penn station. %$* 53
that money has not yet been spent. %$* 53
i think that's something, hardening of the tunnels, increasing communications, coming up with more sensitive detectors as far as gases and chemicals, all that has to be done. %$* 53
so, yes, to answer your question, more has to be spent. %$* 53
the exact amount we have to see. %$* 53
i wish secretary chertoff had used a better choice of words in describing his sense of priorities. %$* 53
do you think that congress is in a position to make spending priority decisions when it comes to security? %$* 164
do you, as you suggest, believe it would be all right to say:  here is a bucket of money, spend it on security where you think it's going to spend? %$* 164
would congress go for that, and is that a better idea? %$* 164
king:  i think it might be a better idea, but i don't think congress is going to go for it yet. %$* 164
and congress should never abdicate -- i don't mean that. %$* 164
i think we can set general standards, for instance, set x amount of dollars for port security, for rail security, put it in one pot and let the secretary decide there. %$* 164
having said that, we should monitor very carefully. %$* 164
we have to have strict oversight which is why it's so important that the house has set up a permanent homeland security committee to be monitoring day to day what the department is doing. %$* 164
and secretary chertoff, in fairness to him, has only been in office several months and he has shown tremendous dedication to the job. %$* 164
what he's doing, which could end up bringing hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars more to a place like new york. %$* 164
he is strongly supporting threat-based funding. %$* 164
and that's the most important thing to help a place such as new york city, metropolitan area, houston, texas, for that matter, with its petrochemical plants. %$* 164
he wants to have the funding based entirely on threat. %$* 164
and that will necessarily guarantee more money going to subway systems in places such as new york city. %$* 164
whether or not the money is allocated per se to transit, by having that much money available to a high-threat area such as new york, it would guarantee much more money coming in for the subway system. %$* 164
new york republican congressman peter king, we thank you so much. %$* 164
thank you, candy. %$* 53
judge roberts is going one-on-one with senators today. %$* 164
an up-close-and-personal chance to win votes for his confirmation to the supreme court. %$* 164
roberts has been meeting with top members of the judiciary committee who will have the first say on his nomination. %$* 164
while members of both parties say roberts' prospects look good at this point, democrats say they will not be a rubber stamp. %$* 164
roberts also seems to be faring pretty well in the court of public opinion, as our senior political analyst, bill schneider, reports. %$* 164
the president's supreme court nominee seems to be making a good impression in washington. %$* 317
by all accounts, he's a very nice man. %$* 298
the public's first impression:  cautiously positive; 54 percent. %$* 317
before president bush announced the nomination, political forces seemed poised for a red-blue showdown. %$* 317
is there deep division over john roberts? %$* 317
not really. %$* 317
republicans certainly like him: 80 percent. %$* 317
but democrats are not lined up against him at this point: just 24 percent negative opinion, 35 percent positive. %$* 317
no leap to judgment, except maybe among late-night comedians. %$* 317
... and i think he's handsome. %$* 20
he looks kind of like that guy that married mindy from "mork and mindy." %$* 20
what is that, mark harmon. %$* 20
yes, or maybe that guy from "j.a.g." %$* 20
i like "j.a.g." %$* 20
i like saying "j.a.g." %$* 20
does the public think roberts' views are mainstream or too extreme? %$* 317
three-quarters say they need to know more about him. %$* 317
republicans and democrats both feel that way. %$* 317
the debate is likely to be over roberts' views on the issues, specifically abortion. %$* 317
if the question is asked in the context:  are you going to uphold roe and i think that crosses the line. %$* 309
many senate democrats disagree. %$* 317
i don't think it's too much to ask a nominee this question:  do you think that americans have a right to privacy? %$* 710
a lot of voters want to know, too. %$* 317
we want to know will you save roe? %$* 907
three-quarters of the public say it's fair for senators to ask roberts questions about abortion. %$* 317
republicans and democrats both want to know. %$* 317
most people think it's fair to ask him how he would rule on abortion cases, especially democrats. %$* 317
republicans are split. %$* 317
of course, asking is one thing, answering is another. %$* 317
i think senators can ask any questions they want, but these justice nominations really don't have to answer them. %$* 409
roberts may not. %$* 317
he didn't during his appeals court confirmation hearing two years ago. %$* 317
my personal views, personal ideology, those have no role to play whatever. %$* 405
laura bush and sandra day o'connor hoped the president would nominate a woman. %$* 317
they may be disappointed, but only 21 percent of the public is bothered and just 28 percent of women. %$* 317
democrats? %$* 317
38 percent. %$* 317
gender matters more to democrats than to most women. %$* 317
senators are politicians. %$* 317
they know what happened after the clarence thomas confirmation vote in 1991:  1992 became the year of the woman when four new women senators were elected. %$* 317
all very nice, interesting figures, but most people don't get to vote on a supreme court justice. %$* 164
so, is there any evidence along the line that public opinion about a supreme court nominee has ever made a difference in the process? %$* 164
well, i can speak to that from experience. %$* 317
i covered the bork confirmation in 1987 and the thomas confirmation in -- the bork's nonconfirmation -- and the thomas confirmation in 1991. %$* 317
and i remember getting calls from staffs of senators, particularly southern democrats, who were the swing voters, who wanted to know what the polls showed, particularly what they showed of african-american opinion, because southern democrats relied on that to stay in office. %$* 317
in bork's case, african-american opinion was negative and most of them voted against him. %$* 317
in thomas's case, african-american opinion at that time was positive and most of them voted to confirm him. %$* 317
that was a silly question, they're always watching the polls. %$* 164
of course. %$* 317
thanks, bill. %$* 164
more on john roberts next from a republican on the judiciary committee. %$* 164
i'll talk with senator charles grassley of iowa about the road ahead for the president's nominee. %$* 164
we've seen the attacks in london. %$* 164
what about about security on transit systems here in the u.s.  we'll talk about it in our "strategy session." %$* 164
and later, firsthand accounts of today's attacks in london. %$* 164
we'll check in with our blog reporters. %$* 164
for more on the nomination of john roberts for the supreme court, i am joined from capitol hill by republican senator charles grassley of iowa. %$* 164
he is a member of the judiciary committee. %$* 164
thanks for being with us, senator grassley. %$* 164
i wanted to note that before the president picked his nominee, you had said, well, you wouldn't be really surprised if we ended up with the kind of battles that you all had over some of those circuit court judges. %$* 164
now that you've had almost 48 hours to digest this and listen to your fellow senators, you want to change your prediction? %$* 164
well, i think i have to. %$* 751
it's much more quiet than i thought. %$* 751
people that you would normally think would fight this president's judges are relatively quiet, reserving judgment, probably going to hope that something will come up that will be very controversial. %$* 751
well -- and speaking of that, i want to show you a couple of poll numbers that we got recently. %$* 164
we asked people, would it be all right for senators to ask roberts his general views on abortion? %$* 164
seventy-four percent of americans said, well, that would be appropriate; 22 percent said it would be inappropriate. %$* 164
so what about the question, "generally, judge roberts, how do you feel about abortion?" %$* 164
well, i think to -- a very general question that doesn't go to the specifics of a case that he might have to rule on or would prejudge him so he would have to recuse himself from future cases would be ok. %$* 751
but on the other hand, you know, you shouldn't expect judges to meet litmus test-type questions to determine whether or not he's going to be on the bench. %$* 751
we should expect to have a clear view of how he's going to approach issues. %$* 751
we should have -- make sure that he's got the competence to do the job, overall honesty, a good educational background. %$* 751
and then i suppose for some of us, you know, is he a real strict interpreter of the constitution and laws, or is he a little more liberal in those and maybe going -- bordering on making laws? %$* 751
i think those are the things that we have a right to know and ought to know, but not how he might rule in some areas. %$* 751
well, look, i think this is a little confusing to the general public. %$* 164
and that is, do you think it's all right to find out what the nominee's personal opinions are about abortion and how is that relevant? %$* 164
you should not find out what their personal opinions are unless they were going to use those personal opinions in their judgment. %$* 751
because... %$* 751
well, he's going to say no to that. %$* 164
but then a person shouldn't be on the bench if they're going to use their personal opinions to reach a decision. %$* 751
a judge is supposed to look at the facts of a case and apply the laws to the facts, and that's -- and they have blinders on otherwise. %$* 751
and what about past cases on anything? %$* 164
can you ask a nominee, "listen, this case was decided; what do you think of roe v. %$* 164
wade?" %$* 164
well, i think that that's only legitimate from the standpoint that they would see how they would use that case to apply to a future case, but only in the very general sense of that being an issue. %$* 751
if they were asking how do you feel about this case as it might apply to another case, that would be entirely wrong. %$* 751
senator grassley, one of the things -- just as a closing question -- that interested me was that it's possible that some republicans may see more harm in this nomination than others. %$* 164
you have senator brownback who has said or indicated he seems a little worried that there are not some definitive cases that tell you about this judge, that perhaps he has been too reticent to take sides. %$* 164
what do you make of that? %$* 164
if you look at the history of the supreme court, that's immaterial. %$* 751
until just recently, did we have judges that came from other courts to make up everybody on the court -- and it's only been recently. %$* 751
you know, in 1950, we had three former senators on the supreme court. %$* 751
there wasn't any judgment at that time that you could be used. %$* 751
and i think you ought to look at senator kennedy, how he observed souter in his answering to the questions 15 years ago. %$* 751
kennedy made a statement, something to the effect that souter didn't have respect for privacy rights and he would have to vote to overturn roe v. wade. %$* 751
just see how wrong kennedy was on souter, and then you see why it's somewhat immaterial to draw conclusions about how somebody might rule. %$* 751
that's why we've got to direct our attention to a very general approach of his competence interpreting law versus making law and his educational background and his dispassionate approach to the law. %$* 751
senator charles grassley, republican of iowa, member of the judiciary committee, thanks so much for your input. %$* 164
glad to be with you. %$* 751
witnesses to the london attacks describe what they saw. %$* 164
we want to check in with our blog reporters next to hear firsthand accounts of today's terror attacks. %$* 164
inside politics continues with a quick update on today's attacks in london. %$* 164
two subway lines remain closed following today's attacks on three subway trains and a double-decker bus. %$* 164
police describe the attacks as, quote, "attempted bombings." %$* 164
and there is an unconfirmed report that one person was injured in the relatively small blast. %$* 164
today's attacks come exactly two weeks after bombings on similar targets. %$* 164
but prime minister tony blair says it is too early to say if the attacks are connected. %$* 164
well candy, clearly today's attacks in london did not have the same effect that they did two weeks ago. %$* 501
but one thing we are saying similar is the role of the blogs as a tool of communication, a way of getting firsthand account and instantaneous information out to people. %$* 501
we went over to europhobia.blogspot.com. %$* 501
we did take a look at them back on the 7th. %$* 501
so, decided to go back to them today. %$* 501
and they were live blogging extensively. %$* 501
two notes that we wanted to show you, or two links that they had that we thought were notable, one of them, as they noticed, that the traditional media is into their blogs this time around. %$* 501
they have a link to the "financial times." %$* 501
and they have a blog roundup that a lot of people are talking about. %$* 501
another link that they had we thought was interesting was the wikipedia entry. %$* 501
we should tell you what this is. %$* 501
we've talked about it before. %$* 501
it's an online encyclopedia that is created by updated, constantly changing and evolving as more information comes out about something. %$* 501
there is already an entry for today, it's 21 july, 2005, london explosions. %$* 501
and this will constantly change. %$* 501
so, you can check it out now and it will evolving as more and more information comes out. %$* 501
and the firsthand accounts are coming out, as well. %$* 384
and one place to get those is a site we looked at a couple of weeks ago, the london blogger tube mac. %$* 384
this is at londonbloggers.imcal.com. %$* 384
and it ranges the london blogs, over 2000 of them, according to this site, registered with this site. %$* 384
according to the their geographic location, which tube stop are they nearest to. %$* 384
and west london, shepherd's bush was the scene of one of the incidents earlier, you can go there to find six blogs at that station. %$* 384
one of them, featherboa.blogspot.com, a woman working in a shop right next door to the police cordon. %$* 384
she blogs that there was a confusion, people being evacuated. %$* 384
the police line was right by where she was. %$* 384
primary school kids being led away. %$* 384
wandering around there that maybe this was just a local loony, that's what she was writing, right afterwards. %$* 384
another one at the oval station, stephzucconi.blogspot.com, this now in south london. %$* 384
for the second time in two weeks this blogger is blogging from behind a police cordon. %$* 384
he's also wondering in a later post what role the closed circuit television cameras that he says are extensive around the area will play in picking up what happened and who did this. %$* 384
that same theme over at foreign dispatches.typepad.com, saying that one of the perps seems to have fled the scene. %$* 325
here's an opportunity for the closed circuit cameras to prove their worth. %$* 325
that was actually a man  that we were seeing here in the united states on local political blogs talking about whether or not these were an invasion of privacy. %$* 325
the right seemed to think that it was something they did not want. %$* 325
we'll see if that emerges again as more information comes out about the events in london. %$* 325
something that we do know is incredibly valuable are the images that come from the scene. %$* 325
and flickr.com, that's f-l-i-c-k-r.com is a photo blog, a group blog, people constantly posting to it. %$* 325
some of the pictures up there now -- this one from the inner cordon at the warren street area, there's a whole group of pictures up there. %$* 325
and that, again, is being added to constantly. %$* 325
back to the oval tube stop in south london, at londonphotobloggers.org, pictures have started coming in there from local people taking photos of what's going on. %$* 384
that picture there is from a blogger named onionbagblogger.blogspot.com. %$* 384
if you go to that one, you can see his pictures, a whole group of them, but also describing that he was in a local school where over a dozen different languages were being spoken. %$* 384
why is anyone trying to bomb such a tolerant community, is what he's saying. %$* 384
police cordons, sirens. %$* 908
his message, you can bomb us every fortnight, but we aren't going anywhere. %$* 908
and that theme of defiance continues. %$* 325
the interesting point over at terrorism unveiled, just that it doesn't have to be successful in terms of body count to be successfully terrifying. %$* 325
candy, we'll send it back to you. %$* 325
jacki schechner, abbi tatton, thanks so much. %$* 164
the "strategy session" is straight ahead on inside politics. %$* 164
today, a new wave of explosions in london's subway system. %$* 164
if london, is the u.s. next? %$* 164
are we prepared to defend against mass transit attacks? %$* 164
welcome back to inside politics and our "strategy session" on today's hottest political topics. %$* 164
with us today, democratic strategist paul begala, and republican strategist rick galen. %$* 164
today's topics:  rail security. %$* 164
london's latest wave of mass transit attacks has the u.s. on renewed alert. %$* 164
is our rail system safe? %$* 164
president bush's supreme court nominee makes more rounds on capitol hill and gets a preview of his senate committee interview. %$* 909
could a memo marked "s" for secret mean "t" for trouble for whoever disclosed the name of a cia operative? %$* 910
the latest strikes on london's mass transit system have no doubt set off fresh waves of alarm in major cities around the world. %$* 910
police say attackers tried to set off explosives at three london subway stations and on a bus, but the explosions resulted in little damage and there have been reports of one injury. %$* 910
the explosions did, once again, raise the question about the security of american mass transit systems. %$* 910
the bush administration says it's on top of it. %$* 910
our mass transit systems remain at a heightened state of alert. %$* 314
it was a step that we took two weeks ago out of an abundance of caution following the attacks that took place in london. %$* 314
there are additional security precautions that we put in place at that point. %$* 314
those included more law enforcement personnel around those systems, bomb-detecting dog teams, increased video surveillance and increased inspections. %$* 314
this seems to me, to be a bit of a shell game where kind of either, you know -- where as the pea keeps moving. %$* 164
but the question today, and it's been raised again by chuck schumer on capitol hill, is why hadn't more money been put into the rail system? %$* 164
i think we've pretty much gone over what chertoff said about all of that, but i mean, where do you stand and what do you think is the advice we can be giving people on capitol hill? %$* 164
should they hammer away at this? %$* 164
should they leave it up to homeland security. %$* 164
i thought your interview with peter king was very interesting. %$* 506
he's a republican member of the house from new york. %$* 506
he's on the homeland security committee -- people who didn't see that segment -- and he wanted both more money and more flexibility. %$* 506
i suspect he would find a very welcome audience among democrats -- at least some democratic colleagues on that. %$* 506
you know, the democratic strategy seems to be and has been for months now -- years, saying that we're under-investing and underfunding in homeland security. %$* 506
yes, we need to fight the terrorist there, but also, we need to protect the homeland. %$* 506
and as someone who comes from the greater houston area, i was glad to hear congressman king say that it's not just rail. %$* 506
petrochemical plants, nuclear plant -- there's a frightening documentary about the indian point nuclear plant new york state and how threatened that could be. %$* 506
i just think it's odd to me that an administration in a party that's built so much of its political strength around the notion that it will fight terrorism competently, doesn't seem to be funding homeland security as much as the experts say they should. %$* 506
well, rich, there was also earlier in the show, an interview with a former homeland security advisor to the white house who said:  look,  the first things we fund are what congress tells us to fund and after 9/11, they told us to fund airplanes. %$* 164
so, where is the balance? %$* 164
yes. %$* 388
i think that's right, candy, and one of the problems i think that everybody runs into -- i mean it's on a hypothetical level -- we want to fund everything to the total extent humanly possible, but there is a -- and i -- we fly a lot. %$* 388
you fly a lot. %$* 388
i just cracked through a million miles on delta to go with my million miles on american. %$* 388
people who fly more than me have their own airplane, ok?. %$* 388
people are -- i don't do this, but a lot of people are still very irritated at what they have to go through at an airport. %$* 388
30 in the morning and having to go through any kind of scrutiny that would get in the way --in between that new york and his coffee regular and his bagel? %$* 911
i mean, it's just not going to happen. %$* 911
and is there-- is there a way, paul, to -- i mean, one of the things that congressman king said was:  i don't think congress is going to give up its control of this. %$* 164
i mean, there is some need to try to micro-manage, if you want to call it that, where these funds go and isn't it true that you can't -- look, mall of america: shouldn't we be protecting that? %$* 164
i mean, how do you make those decisions? %$* 164
yes. %$* 506
yes, but congress needs to make the big decisions. %$* 506
for example, i mean the thing that has bothered me now for years is tax cuts versus homeland security. %$* 506
no president has ever cut taxes in time of war. %$* 506
in 227 years of american our history, it has never happened. %$* 506
why, because in time of war, every president used to understand that protecting our lives is the most important thing. %$* 506
if there's money left over to cut my taxes, great. %$* 506
i'm all for it. %$* 506
but first, secure the mall of america. %$* 506
secure the petrochemical plants. %$* 506
secure the nuclear plants. %$* 506
secure the borders and the ports. %$* 506
we know they can't be perfect, but they certainly can be better and i think that's the argument that democrats and now many republicans like congressman king are beginning to make. %$* 506
well, one of the problems i think we're in, we're in because of the nature of our political system on capitol hill across the street here -- is that everybody needs some piece of this pie. %$* 388
you've got to give little things out and i have traveled around and seen that in a lot of these smaller communities, smaller counties, they haven't any homeland security issues to speak of, so they use the money to buy cop toys. %$* 388
ok, small town in, you know, upper iguana, you don't need the money, we do need it in the bronx. %$* 912
everybody stay put. %$* 164
when our "strategy session" returns, president bush's supreme court nominee goes to capitol hill for meetings with the very lawmakers who could make or break his elevation to the high court. %$* 164
the "strategy session" continues after this. %$* 164
the "strategy session" continues on inside politics. %$* 164
with us:  paul begala and rich galen. %$* 164
it is another meet-and-greet day for supreme court nominee john roberts. %$* 164
the appellate court judge tapped by president bush this week, paid a round of courtesy calls on key senators today, getting some ideas of what to expect in confirmation hearings. %$* 164
meanwhile, mr. bush once again praised his supreme court choice. %$* 164
he has got the experience, wisdom, fairness and civility to be a really good judge. %$* 161
he has a profound respect for the rule of law. %$* 161
he respects the liberties guaranteed in our constitution to all americans, from people from all walks of life. %$* 161
he'll strictly apply the constitution. %$* 161
he's not going to legislate from the bench. %$* 161
well, at this point, after having heard some of what's going on on capitol hill, i'm not sure who he's trying to convince anymore. %$* 164
but the organization of american states? %$* 506
like the chileans are going to for him? %$* 506
well, you know, you can never get too many people behind you. %$* 164
listen, if you're advising a senator, what do you ask him to ask? %$* 164
what do you say? %$* 164
go out there and ask him this. %$* 164
once the hearings come? %$* 506
yes. %$* 164
oh, my goodness. %$* 506
ask about his philosophy on these important judicial issues -- not a particular case. %$* 506
there's cases on parental consent on abortion and so forth moving there way up; the supreme court will get them. %$* 506
do you believe is abortion is a constitutional right or is it simply something that should be left to the states? %$* 913
do you believe that brown versus board, which said that... %$* 913
but isn't that a case? %$* 164
i mean isn't... %$* 164
of course it is... %$* 506
i mean, can't he say look this might come up at some point. %$* 164
i can't possibly... %$* 164
yes, but so what. %$* 506
this separate-but-equal is a fairly -- it's not a case anymore. %$* 388
brown v. board. %$* 388
the questions ought to be about the topics that they should rule on. %$* 506
we shouldn't ask him how he feels about frank robinson -- how the job he's doing as the manager of the washington nationals. %$* 506
he finally sent down guzman, so that's -- %$* 388
that was a great move. %$* 506
but, what should they ask about? %$* 506
just level with us, just tell the truth judge. %$* 752
look, he's going to make it. %$* 752
ok. %$* 752
he's going to be confirmed. %$* 752
but the democrats i hope will put him through his paces, and have him say, no, abortion may be good or bad but it's not in the constitution, or yes, it's a constitutional right, and roe was right deciding. %$* 752
those are both honorable positions. %$* 752
isn't that a trap? %$* 164
look, this is by all accounts i don't know, but by all accounts, i've talked to republican, democratic lawyers, this is one of the smartest guys within the district of columbia. %$* 388
i mean, he's just a brilliant guy. %$* 388
and this is like when i used to travel with newt gingrich, you always waited for the guy in the back who thought he had the killer question, he was going to get newt. %$* 388
you're not going to find a killer question for this guy. %$* 388
he's going to have this figured out. %$* 388
he's got ed gillespie with him, fred thompson, the entire white house helping him figure this stuff out. %$* 388
they will ask those questions. %$* 388
he'll answer those questions. %$* 388
will he falsely deny that he has an opinion like clarence thomas who just, his pants were on fire. %$* 506
he said, well, i never debated roe versus wade. %$* 506
that's baloney... %$* 506
yeah, but we're not doing -- we're not doing... %$* 388
...or will he dance it like more recent nominees and say gee, it's inappropriate to answer questions about the job i'm trying to get. %$* 506
i don't think either of those are good answers. %$* 506
he should tell the truth. %$* 506
but the reality is that... %$* 388
call me a dreamer. %$* 506
well, you are. %$* 388
and we'll wake you up in time for the commercial. %$* 388
crowley:  we love you for that. %$* 388
but i'm not the only one. %$* 506
the question is, is this man qualified to be an associate justice of the united states supreme court or not. %$* 388
that's not the question. %$* 506
sure it is. %$* 388
it's a question. %$* 388
is he qualified? %$* 388
no, the constitution does not say the senate will advise and consent on qualifications. %$* 506
the senate can and should, i think, look at temperament, look at qualifications. %$* 506
they looked at the personal life of poor doug ginsburg and bounced him out because he smoked pot. %$* 506
they looked at the personal life of clarence thomas -- i'm not for that -- but i think they should, instead, look at his views about the issues that judges rule on. %$* 506
just went through it two years ago when he was confirmed for the circuit court, there's not much about this guy... %$* 388
he dodged and ducked then, because it was a lower court. %$* 506
well, it was a lower court, but it was legitimate -- he also might do the same thing. %$* 388
but one of the things that i think is interesting that the republicans are doing, and i think will in this case, and i haven't been a huge fan of the way we've handled some of the public affairs parts of this stuff -- but they have pretty much allowed the vocal wing, the vocal left wing of the democratic party to have pretty much a free ride. %$* 388
i mean, on the way over here, i was listening to maxine waters saying all the reasons that she hates him and she said, and george bush is not as clever as he thinks he is. %$* 388
and i was laughing, and i said, but he's a lot more clever than you are by the way. %$* 388
has the left done itself any favors by -- you know, within 14 hours, demonstrating in front of the supreme court, no more conservative judges. %$* 164
i mean, does that help or hurt whatever case may be made against him? %$* 164
it doesn't make the slightest bit of difference to the senators who are going to vote on this. %$* 506
i really don't. %$* 506
no, but it makes a difference as you begin move down when -- as real americans, not dopes like us, but real americans, as they move forward into the midterm elections and they look for a party identification with which they feel more comfortable, this does not help. %$* 388
but here's the thing. %$* 506
the cnn poll out today, three- fourths of the american people think we ought to asking this judge roberts about his views on issues like abortion. %$* 506
so, that's a massive majority of the country. %$* 506
that's not the same thing as the national abortion rights action league saying that he's an extremist and... %$* 388
the right wing groups we're running ads even before the nominee was named, my goodness. %$* 506
so, both sides have been, i think, a little ridiculous at the extremes. %$* 506
but i have said both parties' senators have been very responsible. %$* 506
one more time, stand by. %$* 164
we'll be right back. %$* 164
the john roberts' nomination is stealing the limelight right now but white house aid karl rove remains in the back of washington's mind. %$* 164
the latest when we come back. %$* 164
i'm wolf blitzer in new york. %$* 142
coming up at the top of the hour, two weeks to the day after the deadly london transit bombings, a brazen attempt to repeat the crime. %$* 142
just how much can the west do to protect transit riders against terrorists? %$* 142
court nominee john roberts courting votes on capitol hill. %$* 142
how much progress is he making in his bid for confirmation? %$* 142
and get this, an illegal tunnel under the united states' border with canada. %$* 142
we'll tell you who's accused of digging it and why. %$* 142
all those stories, much more minutes away on "wolf blitzer reports." %$* 142
now back to inside politics. %$* 142
the "strategy session" continues on inside politics. %$* 164
with us, paul begala and rich galen. %$* 164
karl rove is getting a bit of a break from all the media attention, thanks to the john roberts supreme court nomination. %$* 164
president bush's chief strategist has been the object of reporters' attention over the leak of cia operative valerie plame's identity. %$* 164
today there is a new development. %$* 164
the "washington post" reports on a classified state department memo marked "s" for top secrete in which plame's married name appears. %$* 164
if anyone in the white house saw that and still leaked her identity, that person could be in a world of trouble. %$* 164
i'm not sure it was top secret. %$* 388
it said secret. %$* 388
yeah, right. %$* 164
it didn't say "ts," it said "s," secret. %$* 164
so what does this mean to the story, explain this to me. %$* 164
where are we now? %$* 164
it means that the first of the republican talking points is now no longer operative. %$* 506
isn't that what ron ziegler said during watergate? %$* 506
the first talking point that my republican friends had was, there is no crime here. %$* 506
she wasn't undercover. %$* 506
this wasn't secret. %$* 506
well first off, if she wasn't undercover, why did the cia refer it for prosecution to begin with. %$* 506
and second, why has this prosecutor spent two years on a groundless case. %$* 506
it seemed to me... %$* 506
but wait a minute %$* 388
bill clinton, and you said there's nothing here. %$* 388
but now we have proof. %$* 506
now we have a memo, we don't know who received it, but we certainly know that the state department was telling people about her identity and the fact that her identity was secret. %$* 506
and yet, that identity was leaked. %$* 506
that's a pretty strong piece of evidence for the prosecution. %$* 506
but it's not contemporaneous with what she was doing when all of this started. %$* 388
she had not been a covert officer for some time. %$* 388
she was not undercover at the cia. %$* 388
she was using her real name... %$* 388
if that's true, than patrick fitzgerald is the most inept lawyer in america, because he spent pursuing something that is groundless. %$* 506
but he did, believe me, was go to the cia and say, does this meet the qualifications for the statute that i'm trying to enforce here. %$* 506
let me just ask you one quick question, did you have that same opinion about ken starr who spent all that time pursuing your guy bill clinton? %$* 388
i don't remember you saying... %$* 388
ken starr was an out of control prosecutor. %$* 506
do you believe fitzgerald was? %$* 506
may be. %$* 388
we don't know. %$* 388
we'll see which way this comes out. %$* 388
the new strategy will be to trash fitzgerald, candy. %$* 506
i think the new strategy, rich. %$* 506
it worked ok for you. %$* 914
starr was nuts. %$* 506
this guy seems to be pretty reasonable. %$* 506
he was. %$* 506
do we know what this investigation is currently about? %$* 164
does it look as though someone's being looked at for perjury? %$* 164
is it really about what we -- do we know what it's about? %$* 164
do we know anything? %$* 164
here's where talking point two collapses. %$* 506
which is that, it's very hard to violate intelligence identity's protection act of 1982, the iipa. %$* 506
that's true. %$* 506
the problem with that talking point is it's not the only law potentially violated here. %$* 506
and i stress potentially: perjury, obstruction of justice, conspiracy and the worst, most pernicious thing in the federal code, 18 u.s. code 1001, which says if anybody lies to a federal investigator, he or she goes to jail. %$* 506
that's why martha stewart did time. %$* 506
it's a terrible law, but it's a law. %$* 506
and you can't break it. %$* 506
galen:  i don't disagree with any of that. %$* 506
the question is, that we don't know whether fitzgerald, your guy... %$* 506
he's ashcroft's appointee by the way. %$* 506
...is after a reporter or a white house employee or somebody else all together. %$* 388
we have no idea what trail he's down. %$* 388
let me steer this just sort of towards politics, if it isn't already there. %$* 164
and ask you, bill clinton said this morning i think on the "today show" -- do democrats want to get karl rove because he's so brilliant and he's beating them over the head for eight years? %$* 164
and he said well, there's something to that. %$* 164
is there something to that? %$* 164
well, i can only speak for myself, karl's a long time acquaintance of mine. %$* 506
we go way back. %$* 506
and when this all first broke, i went on national television on this network endorsed him. %$* 506
i said i believe karl when he said he had nothing to do with this. %$* 506
and i look like a chump. %$* 506
ok, karl lied. %$* 506
and i like karl, but he lied. %$* 506
he told scott mcclellan to tell america that he had nothing to do with this, that it was ridiculous. %$* 506
and now we know he had everything to do with it. %$* 506
maybe it's not a crime, maybe it is, but he was at the center of this. %$* 506
you have to stop doing that. %$* 388
and don't look shocked at me because you know. %$* 388
they said he had nothing to do with it, they meant he was at the center of the it. %$* 506
to use your guys, the way that he put it, it depends on what the definition of it is. %$* 388
if the it has to do with -- valerie plame... %$* 388
i am loving this. %$* 506
identifying valerie plame as a covert officer of the cia, than he is absolutely correct. %$* 388
he had nothing to do with it. %$* 388
all we know is a, one reporter called and b another, all did he was say i heard that too. %$* 388
if you go to for that, we're in trouble. %$* 388
we'll bring you back. %$* 164
you can start. %$* 164
i don't believe you're as calm and collected as you're supposed to be on our "strategy session." %$* 164
but we'll forgive you this one time. %$* 164
we are not finished with the karl rove story. %$* 164
it is still a big story on the blogs. %$* 164
an update on the rove debate online next when we rejoin our blog reporters. %$* 164
turning to our "political bytes," new york senator hillary clinton is well ahead of a potential 2006 republican opponent in a new poll of state voters. %$* 164
a siena college survey finds clinton leading westchester county district attorney janine pirro 57 percent to 31 percent. %$* 164
60 percent of voters surveyed also said they think senator clinton should be reelected. %$* 164
a published report says top republicans, including karl rove, want florida congresswoman katherine harris to run for reelection to the house, instead of running for the senate. %$* 164
"the washington times" reports rove and republican senatorial committee chair elizabeth dole are concerned by polls that show harris winning the primary and losing the general election. %$* 164
first lady laura bush is scheduled to attend two fundraisers today. %$* 164
she was to appear at a lucntime event for congressman jim garlick in king of prussia, pennsylvania. %$* 164
and a few hours from now, she attends a reception for maryland governor bob ehrlich. %$* 164
in california, a new poll finds more golden state voters now approve of the way president bush is handling his job than approve of governor arnold schwarzenegger. %$* 164
according to the public policy institute of california, the president has a 38 percent approval rating, while schwarzenegger has a 34 percent approval mark. %$* 164
back here in washington, developer donald trump appeared at a senate hearing today. %$* 164
trump has said the u.n. headquarters can be rennovated for less than half of what the united nations says is needed. %$* 164
some in congress are concerned that u.s. taxpayers will shoulder too much of the planned $1.2 billion project. %$* 164
bloggers continue to debate the karl rove cia leak story online. %$* 164
we want to rejoin cnn political producer abbi tatton and john schechner, our blog reporter -- jacki. %$* 164
yesterday, lefty bloggers, candy, were clamoring to keep the karl rove/valerie plame affair front and center in the mainstream media. %$* 325
today they got exactly what they wanted. %$* 325
well, close to it. %$* 325
definitely front and to the right. %$* 325
over at blah3.com, they've got the front page of the "washington post." %$* 325
the valerie plame identity memo story is right there on the front page above the fold. %$* 325
and they say that while everyone was jabbering about what's his name, the judge, this is what the "washington post" was working on. %$* 325
daily kos is saying the same thing. %$* 384
glad that this story is front and center and not the story about the roberts nomination, saying it looks like bush rushed forth this nomination for no good reason at all. %$* 384
but that's getting attention from conservatives. %$* 384
james joyner at outside the beltway says that that is just ludicrus to say that this was rushed to take the spotlight away from rove, saying that getting a replacement by october for sandra day o'connor who often voted against the interests of the bush administration was not what they absolutely wanted to do in this circumstance. %$* 384
so, talking about the memo that did make the front page of "the washington post" that talking about valerie plame's secret identity, but also in the memo on something that a lot of the bloggers on the left are pointing out was actually the main point of the memo, that being why state department experts did not think that saddam hussein was trying to buy uranium from niger. %$* 325
and they say over at washingtonmonthly.com, this is kevin drum  posting. %$* 325
this was back in february of 2002, the state department was trying to talk to anyone who would listen. %$* 325
unfortunately, no one would listen. %$* 325
we wanted to show you one associated press photo that's doing the rounds today. %$* 384
it's over here crooksandliars.com. %$* 384
a photo from the summer of 2003, the summer in question, depicts karl rove and robert novak standing together at a party. %$* 384
it's notable for the button that karl rove is wearing, saying i'm a source, not a target. %$* 384
that you can see right here. %$* 384
if you can't read it there on the screen. %$* 384
obviously taking on a new relevance right now as the story develops. %$* 384
candy, back to you. %$* 384
abbi tatton, jacki schechner thanks so much. %$* 164
we're going to call it a day now on inside politics. %$* 164
i'm candy crowley. %$* 164
"wolf blitzer reports" right now. %$* 164

now live from washington, cnn's inside politics. %$* 116
thanks for joining us. %$* 597
i'm lisa sylvester. %$* 597
we begin with supreme court nominee john roberts under the microscope and the subject of partisan bickering. %$* 597
even as roberts continues to make the rounds on the hill, republicans and democrats remain at odds over the start-date for confirmation hearings and whether the administration has made enough of the judge's paper trail public. %$* 597
documents that have been released are shedding some additional light on roberts' views and how he might rule on the high court. %$* 597
here's our white house correspondent, suzanne malveaux. %$* 597
on john roberts' first day at the justice department in the summer of 1981, the 26-year-old lawyer was assigned to prepare sandra day o'connor for her supreme court confirmation hearings. %$* 307
roberts, who would be poised to succeed o'connor on the high court nearly a quarter century later, advised her quote, "avoid giving specific responses to any direct questions on legal issues." %$* 307
on judicial activism, documents show roberts discouraged it supporting republican legislation instead that would limit the supreme court's jurisdiction over abortion, busing and school prayer. %$* 307
on affirmative action, roberts rejected a positive report about the program by the u.s. commission on civil rights, saying, "there is no recognition of the obvious reason for failure. %$* 307
the affirmative action program required the recruiting of inadequately prepared candidates." %$* 307
on school desegregation, roberts questioned the efficacy of bussing in a draft letter for the attorney general, saying, "we do not believe bussing is necessary to provide the equal educational opportunity mandated by brown, the supreme court decision that made segregation of public facilities unconstitutional. %$* 307
and on sex discrimination, roberts advocated limits to the law affecting gender equality for college sports. %$* 307
so, lisa, of course the big question is:  what does this really say about roberts' thinking? %$* 307
does it really give us a window into his thinking? %$* 307
well, of course, some legal scholars are saying:  perhaps very little. %$* 307
they say when you look at the formal drafts in the letters, it reflects the administration's ideas, but if you look at the handwritten notes, perhaps you get an own sense of his opinions. %$* 307
democrats are arguing however, they want recent records, most importantly, that at his time at the solicitor general's office -- lisa? %$* 307
suzanne malveaux at the white house. %$* 597
thank you very much for that report. %$* 597
in the lead-up to roberts' confirmation hearings the ranking democrat on the senate judiciary committee is trying to keep the pressure on republicans. %$* 597
senator patrick leahy is leading the charge against chairman arlen specter's proposal to begin hearings at the end of august, in part because he wants adequate time to review roberts' records. %$* 597
on the senate floor today, leahy urged the white house to release documents from roberts' work from the first bush administration, in addition to thousands of pages made public from the reagan era. %$* 597
begin video clip) %$* 597
the white house is eager to supply documents it selected and certainly provided it with great fanfare. %$* 598
but we have yet to receive the documents that we have in fact requested. %$* 598
it's an unfortunate pattern we've see too often. %$* 598
public opinion seems to be on john roberts' side. %$* 597
a new quinnipiac poll shows 44 percent of americans approve of roberts' nomination. %$* 597
about one-fourth disapprove. %$* 597
a little more than a fourth are unsure. %$* 597
forty percent of those surveyed say roberts would make the supreme court more conservative, compared to five percent who think he'd make the court more liberal. %$* 597
twenty-nine percent predict no change. %$* 597
and 53 percent say public opinion of roberts' nomination should have a great deal of influence on whether he's confirmed, but only six percent believe it will have a great deal of influence. %$* 597
unlike john roberts, you don't see president bush on capitol hill every day, but he was there today. %$* 597
evidence that a trade agreement he's promoting is facing a tough fight in congress. %$* 597
our congressional correspondent, ed henry, has more on the pact and showdown vote that could come as soon as tonight. %$* 597
with key initiatives like social security reform stalled, president bush made a rare visit to capitol hill to rally his own party behind a struggling trade pact. %$* 308
republicans emerged fired-up, insisting the free trade deal with help the united states by shoring up emerging democracies in central america. %$* 308
why in the world should people stick to the path of democracy if supposedly the richest, most generous democracy in the world rejects a trade agreement with these countries? %$* 21
but democrats shot back:  the deal is bad for america and will lead to more lost of manufacturing jobs. %$* 308
the american people will know in a very clear way the difference between how the democrats are fighting for them and how the republicans are ignoring their aspirations. %$* 201
republican leaders counter the pact will create jobs and guaranteed victory. %$* 308
it will be a tough vote, but we will pass cafta tonight. %$* 510
we will honor our commitments to our neighbors to the south. %$* 510
we will protect our national security and we will do it all with very few democrats. %$* 510
but the president is facing major defections in his own ranks, so the republican leadership has resorted to wheeling and dealing on the highway bill, promising lawmakers roads and bridges to scrounge up votes. %$* 308
but that has not swayed republican opponents worried it will decimate the textile and sugar industries. %$* 308
if we don't protect the jobs in america one day, the flags that cover the coffins of the brave who die for this country, the flags that cover those coffins might say "made in china or "made in honduras." %$* 31
let's save america and god help us save america and let's do what is right and kill this enemy that's called cafta. %$* 31
the wheeling and dealing will continue into the wee small hours. %$* 308
we're not expecting a vote until at least midnight and it's not just the president who is twisting arms. %$* 308
secretary of state condoleezza rice was just spotted in the capitol lobbying, wavering republicans right down to the final hours here. %$* 308
it gives you an idea of just how high the political stakes are for this white house -- lisa? %$* 308
and it certainly sounds like it's going to be a long night there. %$* 597
now, with the president on the hill, did lawmakers bring up the subject of a troop pull-out from iraq? %$* 597
well, we didn't here about it coming up in the actual meeting, but it's interesting some pressure is coming from more republicans. %$* 308
remember, this resolution that was authored a couple months back republican walter jones, saying the president needs to come up with a timetable next year to start bringing the troops home. %$* 308
republican jim leech, a veteran of the international relations committee, did not appear at the initial press conference for this, but we're told he has signed on as a co-sponsor and now republican wayne gilchrest, a congressman who was actually wounded in vietnam when he was a marine, is going to sign on tomorrow at a second press conference that walter jones is having to add some momentum to this push to get the troops home from iraq -- lisa? %$* 599
all right. %$* 597
thank you very much. %$* 597
ed henry from capitol hill and of course, we will have mr. jones on our show later in this broadcast. %$* 597
would cafta hurt worker security? %$* 249
would it help national security? %$* 249
two congressman will debate those questions ahead. %$* 249
the drive to pass an emergency bill compromise. %$* 316
will it do anything to lower gas prices? %$* 316
we'll tell you what's in the measure and what's not. %$* 316
where will his new path lead him? %$* 600
as the massive and long-awaited energy bill nears a final vote in congress, details of the multibillion-dollar legislation are beginning to emerge. %$* 597
our bruce morton takes a look at the fine print. %$* 597
the bill gives energy industries $11.5 billion in subsidies for oil, gas, coal, even nuclear power. %$* 321
but what will it do? %$* 321
the u.s. now imports 58 percent of the oil it uses. %$* 321
federal officials project that will be 68 percent by 2025, and analysts say this bill won't change that much. %$* 321
will it lower gas prices? %$* 321
even the chairman of the house energy committee says that might take a year, and he's one of the optimists. %$* 321
mandates an inventory of current offshore oil and gas reserves, even in areas now off-limits like california and florida. %$* 601
it gives the federal government the exclusive right to approve construction of liquefied national gas facilities, even if governors or local officials object. %$* 601
it doesn't mention drilling the arctic national wildlife refuge in alaska, but that's been approved in other bills and final approval is likely in september. %$* 601
it delays for at least 141 days a u.s. government review of china's bid to purchase unocal. %$* 601
it does not protect the manufacturers of gasoline additive mtbe as suspected carcinogen from lawsuits. %$* 601
it does not require increased fuel efficiency in u.s. cars and trucks. %$* 601
conferees defeated a proposal to require that 10 percent of u.s. electricity come from renewable sources, wind, solar power and so on, by 2020, and a proposal calling on the president to cut u.s. oil consumption, now 20 million barrels a day, by one million barrels a day by the year 2015. %$* 601
one democratic critic called it a scrapple full of pork many democrats will like, and passage is expected this week. %$* 601
and then... %$* 601
i think it's important for the republicans to be able to say they've done something, they've addressed energy finally. %$* 318
but the devil is always in the details and if six months or a year from now people don't see lower energy prices or hear that there is more energy available, they may say the republicans really didn't do very much. %$* 318
the bill does one other thing: it expands daylight saving time, starting it earlier, second sunday in march instead of the first sunday in april, and extending it a week to end on the first sunday in november. %$* 321
this is very important to a powerful lobby, america's children. %$* 321
what it means, kids, is a longer halloween. %$* 321
trick or treat! %$* 321
bruce morton, cnn, washington. %$* 321
new york governor george pataki makes big decision, but another one still looms in our wednesday political bytes. %$* 597
pataki said today he will not run for a fourth term as governor next year. %$* 597
recent polls have shown him trailing state attorney general and probable democratic candidate eliot spitzer. %$* 597
and while pataki has decided to leave albany, he has been mentioned as a possible white house hopeful in 2008. %$* 597
today pataki offered only a slight hint about his future plans. %$* 597
in a year and a half, i will be able to leave this office confident in the future of our great state, because i believe in you. %$* 602
in the meantime, we're going to keep this state moving forward, and come 2007, i will follow a new path, find new challenges, knowing i am leaving the state we love in the best hands possible. %$* 602
former democratic running mates john kerry and john edwards are both expected in new hampshire on friday. %$* 597
kerry will attend a thank you reception for his new hampshire supporters in last year's campaign. %$* 597
edwards will attend a manchester fundraiser for his former new hampshire state chairman. %$* 597
and in the battle for campaign cash, republican john mccain has reportedly taken steps to get his political action committee back up and running. %$* 597
"political moneyline" reports that straight talk america registered as a federal pact earlier this month. %$* 597
just ahead, is free trade the solution or part of the problem? %$* 597
as the white house takes up the central american free trade agreement, i'll talk with two congressman from the same party, but with very different views. %$* 597
as we have reported, president bush was on capitol hill this morning to rally support for the central american free trade agreement. %$* 597
and with me now to talk about cafta, as it's known, are two republicans on opposite sides of the issue. %$* 597
congressman clay shaw of florida supports the trade deal. %$* 597
congressman walter jones of north carolina opposes the agreement. %$* 597
our first question for you, representative shaw. %$* 597
as we just mentioned, president bush was on the hill talking about cafta and house majority leader tom delay is predicting a win tonight. %$* 597
how do you get there, though, from where -- if you only have six to 12 democrats, a handful of democrats voting for it and a number of republicans against it? %$* 597
well, there's a lot of democrats that are kind of hiding their vote at this time, so hopefully we'll grow that total. %$* 603
and hopefully we'll get some of our good friends like walter here to take another look at the issue. %$* 603
it's a win-win for america. %$* 603
and it's simply imposing fair trade where right now there's one-way free trade coming into the united states. %$* 603
we want to level the playing field and have a fair trade and get those tariff barriers down going into central america. %$* 603
so it's good for america, and i think the president made a very good -- a very good pitch this morning. %$* 603
and it was very passionate pitch, as i'm sure my friend walter here will agree. %$* 603
representative jones, do you agree? %$* 597
do you think they actually do have the votes to pass cafta? %$* 597
that there are some hidden democratic votes out there? %$* 597
well, clay shaw is one of my dearest friends and a man i have great respect for. %$* 31
we feel pretty confident right now -- obviously at 3:40 in the afternoon or 3:50, this could change tonight by 7:00 or 8:00. %$* 31
we think we have at least 25 to 28 hard no votes on the republican side. %$* 31
the democrats are telling me that they only feel like they will lose between eight and 10. %$* 31
if those numbers hold true, then we think we're in great shape, defeating this cafta, going back to the negotiating table. %$* 31
representative shaw, you know, i've heard the argument -- in fact, you just described the argument that's been made repeatedly, that cafta will level the playing field, that it will increase exports to central america. %$* 597
but if you look at nafta, those exact same arguments were made then and instead what we've seen are tens-of-thousands of jobs -- american jobs that have been lost. %$* 597
the trade deficit has ballooned. %$* 597
why would anyone expect that cafta would be different? %$* 597
well, don't lose sight of the fact right now the tariff barriers coming into the united states are already down. %$* 603
plus, central america is not that large a piece of the trading situation. %$* 603
i think like 13 percent of our exports go into central america. %$* 603
so, it's not that huge, but i think this goes beyond just simply trade. %$* 603
i was here during the reagan administration and at that time, we had terrible problems down in central america. %$* 603
we had -- the communists were running half the show down there. %$* 603
we had dictatorships. %$* 603
we had  revolutions. %$* 603
now they've settled down. %$* 603
they're looking north to us. %$* 603
they all have democracies, even though they have a lot of poverty down there, still, which this bill would certainly address, they still -- i think, the future of central america could very well hinge on this important agreement. %$* 603
and the future of central america and being pro-american, that is united states american, is very important to our national security. %$* 603
so, this thing has legs that are much longer than just simple trade. %$* 603
lisa, could i speak to that? %$* 31
yes. %$* 597
i was just going to ask you to weigh in, representative jones. %$* 597
i'm sure you have some comments on this. %$* 597
well, let me share with you -- i have a letter signed by seven elected officials from honduras, guatemala, el salvador, nicaragua and just one sentence i want to share with you in this letter. %$* 31
it was written to all members of congress, by the way and it says, "cafta will only lead to more social instability in the region as more medium and small farmers will lose their livelihood and become part of the poor population numbers." %$* 31
they're asking us to vote against this. %$* 31
go back to the negotiating table and do what is right for the central american workers and also the american workers. %$* 31
in my state of north carolina, since nafta, we lost over 200,000 jobs and in this country alone, we lost 2.5 million jobs. %$* 31
congressman shaw, the administration has made it very clear that this is a top priority. %$* 597
and it hasn't been shy at all about asking representatives:  what will it take to sweeten the pot? %$* 597
what will it take to secure their vote, even though as we just heard, there have been thousands of -- tens-of-thousands, in fact, of jobs lost. %$* 597
it puts representative in quite the quandary. %$* 597
now, why not just try to pass cafta on its own merits? %$* 597
well, first of all i would dispute the figures as to the loss of jobs. %$* 603
that is a bogus argument. %$* 603
even though there are some jobs that have gone to mexico, i think that as far as the economy of the united states, nafta has not been a -- has not been a negative. %$* 603
but just look at it this way, you've got right now, about american apparel, up to 23 percent tariff on goods going from the united states into central america; up to 16 percent on textiles. %$* 603
plastics, rubber, i can go right down the line and talk about the tremendous amount of tariffs that the united states manufactures are having to cope with in getting their goods into central america. %$* 603
agriculture -- this thing is huge. %$* 603
you mentioned the poor farmers -- or my friend here, mr. jones, mentioned the poor farmers. %$* 603
obviously there's always some people that are going to be alarmed by free trade. %$* 603
they're no longer going to be protected by a lot of tariffs. %$* 603
but the majority of the people in central america will certainly profit by this. %$* 603
the trade preferences to central america go away at the end of 2006 and at that point, also, perhaps the cut-and- show sew shops, the investment and guess who -- where it will go? %$* 603
it will go to china. %$* 603
well, i've got -- let me just interrupt you there for a moment. %$* 597
congressman jones, i want you to comment, because we're running out of time. %$* 597
but first, quickly, on the jobs issue, because it sounded like you wanted to say something and then your thoughts on the pentagon announcing that it wants to start bringing troops back by next spring or summer. %$* 597
well, i -- the only thing i want to say to my friend, mr. shaw, is my numbers about north carolina and the effect of nafta are absolutely correct, because i've checked with the state of north carolina numerous times and it is in my state 200,000 jobs have been lost due directly to nafta. %$* 31
congressmen, thank you very much for joining us and we'll have to see how this debate shapes up tonight on cafta. %$* 366
i know it's going to be a long night for everyone. %$* 366
and i might add that these countries that we're talking about have been supporting us in iraq and that's important. %$* 603
all right. %$* 597
you get the last word in there. %$* 597
all right. %$* 597
thank you very much, gentlemen. %$* 597
we look forward to having you on again. %$* 597
i'll talk to a top senate democrat and republican about john roberts' records. %$* 390
what's in them and how will they affect the fight of the president's supreme court nominee? %$* 390
will this former surfer ride in a mayor's office that has been under a wave of controversy? %$* 316
the votes are in, but the political saga continues. %$* 316
more inside politics ahead. %$* 316
as the markets get set to close on wall street, i'm joined by kitty pilgrim in new york with "the dobbs report--"  kitty? %$* 597
hi, lisa. %$* 315
thanks. %$* 315
dow industrials are up about 56 points. %$* 604
nasdaq nearly half-of-one percent higher. %$* 604
we had a rough day, however, at delta airlines. %$* 604
delta shares sank 15 percent. %$* 604
that's after the company's ceo sent a memo to employees. %$* 604
the bottom line he said:  the airline's restructuring plan, not enough to save it from bankruptcy. %$* 604
the other steps will be needed. %$* 604
northwest ceo says it, too, may be forced into bankruptcy if the carrier does not quickly cut a billion dollars out of labor costs. %$* 604
however, there is some good news for travelers. %$* 604
we do have good news in the airline industries. %$* 604
delta will let you cancel tickets now without penalties if you find a cheaper fare elsewhere. %$* 604
that's the condition. %$* 604
well, if you're shopping for a new car you'd better act fast. %$* 604
g.m. %$* 604
says it will end employee discounts to everyone this weekend. %$* 604
it's running out of cars. %$* 604
g.m. %$* 604
discounts were so successful that other automakers copied it. %$* 604
ford and chrysler will also end their employee discounts this weekend. %$* 604
so you'd better act fast. %$* 604
00 p.m. eastern on "lou dobbs tonight:" north korea refuses to give up its nuclear weapons and still u.s. negotiators at the talks in beijing are trying to appear upbeat. %$* 605
it's complicated and there was a lot of work that we all had to do, but i think there's also a real spirit there. %$* 81
we should really try to accomplish something. %$* 81
pilgrim:  also tonight, house majority leader tom delay says the house now has enough votes to pass cafta, the controversial free trade agreement with central america. %$* 81
we'll have a full report on that. %$* 81
also, a debate between a republican proponent of cafta and a democratic opponent. %$* 81
another alarming government warning about traveling across the border to mexico. %$* 316
we'll have that and more. %$* 316
do join us. %$* 316
6:00 eastern. %$* 316
"lou dobbs tonight." %$* 316
now back to lisa. %$* 316
and we'll be watching. %$* 597
thanks, kitty. %$* 597
and now back to inside politics and a must-read for many senators and journalists, those reams of documents from john roberts' legal work for the reagan administration. %$* 597
our senior political analyst, bill schneider, has been going over the supreme court nominee's records, looking for clues about the kind of justice he'd be. %$* 597
if you had doubts about whether john roberts, the president's supreme court nominee, is a committed conservative, the documents just released should dispel them. %$* 317
there are more than 15,000 pages from 1981 and '82, when roberts served as special assistant to william french smith, president reagan's first attorney general. %$* 317
they paint a picture of an eager, self-confident food soldier in the reagan revolution. %$* 317
roberts was candid, even fearless, with his superiors, nothing wishy-washy about this young man. %$* 317
in 1981, roberts was asked to review a report on affirmative action by the outgoing chairman of the civil rights commission. %$* 317
roberts dismissed the chairman's argument that failures in affirmative action were caused by sabotage. %$* 317
"there is no recognition of the obvious reason for failure," roberts wrote. %$* 317
"the affirmative action program required the recruiting of inadequately prepared candidates." %$* 317
in 1982, roberts disagreed with the position taken by assistant attorney general ted olson. %$* 317
olson believed legislation pending in congress to limit the supreme court's jurisdiction over abortion, busing and school prayer cases raised constitutional problems. %$* 317
roberts wrote in the margin of olson's memo, "real courage would be to read the constitution as it should be read and not kowtow to the tribes, lewises and brinks." %$* 317
"it really should not matter what the personal ideology of our appointees may be, so long as they recognize that their ideology should have no role in the decisional process," a view that roberts advanced again 21 years later during his confirmation hearing for the federal appeals court. %$* 606
there's no role for advocacy with respect to personal beliefs or views on the part of a judge. %$* 405
but, unlike the appeals court, the supreme court can set precedent. %$* 317
roberts spent his very first day at the justice department helping coach supreme court nominee sandra day o'connor for her confirmation hearings. %$* 317
now he's been nominated to succeed o'connor on the court. %$* 317
how is that for a historical footnote? %$* 317
everything seems to go full circle, doesn't it, bill? %$* 597
it certainly does. %$* 317
all right, thank you very much, bill schneider. %$* 597
well, many senators are poring over roberts' history and making early assessments whether he's likely to get their confirmation vote. %$* 597
today, patrick leahy set a benchmark for rejecting roberts' nomination. %$* 597
in an interview with vermont public radio, the ranking democrat on the judiciary committee was asked if he would vote for roberts if it appeared he would pursue an activist agenda. %$* 597
and the senator responded, "no, i wouldn't." %$* 597
now let's talk to another democrat about roberts' prospects and the current flap over releasing his records. %$* 597
senator ben nelson of nebraska is an influential figure in the confirmation process as a leader of the so-called gang of 14 moderates who averted an earlier battle over judicial nominees. %$* 597
now, i understand that you have been, said that you are leaning toward voting for roberts for confirming him. %$* 597
is that correct? %$* 597
well, what i said is, i see nothing in the process to date that would cause me not to vote for him. %$* 420
the process is continuing, of course. %$* 420
well, we have seen at least 15,000 new pages on roberts released in the last day. %$* 607
was there anything in there that gives you pause, anything that makes you think that he will face more opposition in the senate than previously thought? %$* 607
well, i don't know, but i doubt it. %$* 420
i say that because i don't think that it should be about his judicial -- it shouldn't be about his political philosophy. %$* 420
it should be about his judicial philosophy. %$* 420
in other words, is he in -- is he content to be an adjudicator and doesn't want to be a legislator making law? %$* 420
to me, that is the issue about judge roberts, not that i prejudge that, thinking that he wants to be an activist judge. %$* 420
but i want to be sure that he doesn't plan to be and wouldn't become an activist judge. %$* 420
that's what i think we ought to be looking at. %$* 420
political philosophy is interesting, but judicial philosophy is essential. %$* 420
on that note, speaking of judicial philosophy, a number of senators believe they have to have the documents, all of the documents. %$* 597
in fact, another document fight is brewing over roberts' tax records. %$* 597
will the irs -- i understand the irs will provide a one- page summary. %$* 597
but the bush administration is refusing to release his complete annual tax forms. %$* 597
why is it necessary to have these tax records? %$* 597
well, i don't know. %$* 420
i assume that there are those who want to take a look to make sure that everything is in order. %$* 420
this is a lifetime appointment. %$* 420
i haven't weighed in on the docu-drama that's going on right now, quite honestly. %$* 420
i think the committee ought not to ask for anything it shouldn't and i think the white house, the administration, ought to provide everything that it should. %$* 420
but they ought to be able to work that out. %$* 420
if there is some probative value, some particular level of interest because of -- it bears on his judicial abilities, then i think they're entitled to it. %$* 420
but just to pore over documents because they're there i don't think helps anybody and it isn't going to make a difference in whether this person will be a good judge or not. %$* 420
in terms of the timeline, senator specter has said that he wants to start the hearings august 29, as early as august 29, to bring back senators for that. %$* 597
that would give democrats more than a month to review. %$* 597
is that a sufficient time? %$* 597
i know some democrats are trying to drag this out and they are insisting on a later date. %$* 597
do you agree with them? %$* 597
well, i don't know, because i'm not a member of the judiciary committee. %$* 420
and -- and the nomination is properly before the judiciary committee right now. %$* 420
and they ought to make that decision. %$* 420
but, once again, i don't think anybody ought to be interested in dragging this out. %$* 420
but i do think that a thorough review of the -- of the appropriate documents is in order. %$* 420
that's what the hearing process is all about. %$* 420
so, i certainly support their effort to get the documents. %$* 420
i support their effort to get the right amount of time. %$* 420
and, at this point, i leave that up to them to decide in both cases. %$* 420
well, let me just switch gears really quickly here. %$* 597
the pentagon is now talking about a true pullout as early next spring or summer. %$* 597
how does the u.s. achieve this, though, given the situation that the iraqi police forces are not quite -- they're not even really close to standing on their own two feet at this point? %$* 597
well, i think it's going to be very difficult to pull out any significant number of our troops or of the coalition troops until there's a general belief that the iraqis are in a position now to provide their own self-defense and their own self-government, maybe, in some instances, with our support and our help. %$* 420
but i -- i would like to know more about what the percentage of their capability is. %$* 420
are they 50 percent capable of their self- defense? %$* 420
are they now about 50 percent capable of their self- government, with a constitution hopefully about to be finalized? %$* 420
that's -- those are the questions that i've got. %$* 420
what percentage of capability do they have? %$* 420
if we can answer that, then i think we can begin to decide about the drawdown. %$* 420
important questions. %$* 597
all right, thank you very much, senator ben nelson. %$* 597
thank you. %$* 420
and we'll get a republican take on roberts and how the confirmation process is playing out. %$* 597
up next, i'll talk with senate judiciary committee chair -- member lindsey graham. %$* 597
also head, have san diego voters shut the revolving door at the mayor's office? %$* 597
the results are in. %$* 597
and when we go "inside the blogs," can a missing person be found online? %$* 597
now a republican in the thick of the process of confirming or rejecting supreme court nominee john roberts. %$* 597
we're joined by senator lindsey graham of south carolina, a member of the judiciary committee. %$* 597
thank you very much for joining us today. %$* 597
we certainly appreciate that. %$* 597
yes, ma'am. %$* 176
well, when roberts was advising sandra -- sandra day o'connor, as we have heard, that he was advising her on her confirmation hearings, he said that nominees should not have to answer questions about specific cases. %$* 597
but if the majority of americans, 61 percent, in fact, according to a cnn/"usa today"/gallup poll, think they have a right to know how he will rule on abortion issues, shouldn't he have to answer that question? %$* 597
no. %$* 176
who wants a judge that has decided how the case is going to be determined before they hear it? %$* 176
one hundred percent of americans should want a judge not to make up their mind before they hear the facts. %$* 176
and i just disagree with the poll. %$* 176
if we start making judges tell us in judiciary hearings how they're going to rule on abortion, same-sex marriage, guns, you name it, then they've disqualified themselves from hearing cases, because cases involve individual people. %$* 176
courts are for individual rights. %$* 176
polling is for politics. %$* 176
and we don't want to take polling into the courtroom. %$* 176
well, let me just press you a little bit on that, which is, how are we to know his philosophy, we meaning how are americans supposed to know his philosophy to know what kind of judge he will make, whether or not he's going to be a legislative justice or whether or not he's going to let the -- the -- that judicial process work itself -- itself out? %$* 597
the way he's conducted himself in every job he's had. %$* 176
what do other lawyers who have worked with him think of him? %$* 176
has he been a lawyer that cuts corners, that tries to be overly active? %$* 176
he's been a judge for two years. %$* 176
has he used the robe to become a legislator? %$* 176
what do people think of him who have served with him as a judge, who have worked with him as a lawyer? %$* 176
is there anything in his background to make you believe that he would take his own personal opinions, put on a robe and enact a personal agenda vs. following the law? %$* 176
i think, when you look at those qualities and that standard, you'll find a guy that's very modest in terms of judicial philosophy. %$* 176
he's well respected and will not let a personal agenda get in the way of being a judge in a case that may involve you or me. %$* 176
well, we're learning more about roberts from documents released from the early 1980s. %$* 597
an example is, he spoke out against a u.s. commission on civil rights report, advised the attorney general on how to tactfully refuse a funding request for an atlanta- based center that was named after martin luther king. %$* 597
are these concerns? %$* 597
do you think that these will be roadblocks to his confirmation? %$* 597
if we start holding the advice a lawyer gives to their client against the lawyer in a privileged setting, then we're going to destroy the law. %$* 176
two things should not happen here. %$* 176
we should not hold the fact that -- against judge roberts who he represented or any legal advice he gave at the request of a client or at the request of a boss. %$* 176
i've represented rapists, murders. %$* 176
you name it, i've represented them as a defense attorney in the air force and i've prosecuted him. %$* 176
you shouldn't hold it against me the thoughts of my client. %$* 176
you should not hold it against judge roberts for any legal advice he gave someone seeking legal advice, because that was his job. %$* 176
you should judge him on his abilities as a lawyer, his qualifications, his judicial temperament, because, if we start doing that, people are not going to represent folks that are unpopular. %$* 176
and, on that note, attorney general alberto gonzales said the legal right to abortion was settled for lower courts, but not the supreme court. %$* 597
was this in essence a message to the senate that roberts won't be bound by his past statements that the 1973 roe vs. wade decision essentially settled this issue? %$* 597
if you're a lower court, you're bound by the precedent of the supreme court. %$* 176
if you're a member of the supreme court, you and your colleagues can revisit any area of the law. %$* 176
but to overturn a well-settled area of the law, you've got to find something new. %$* 176
there's a pretty strict standard for that. %$* 176
the idea of having him tell us whether he will affirm or reject a particular case is out of bounds, inappropriate. %$* 176
we're looking at his abilities, his qualifications, not a commitment or a bargain to make to get on the court. %$* 176
it's not about our pet peeves as senators. %$* 176
it's about his qualification as a person and as a judge. %$* 176
so, i don't think anybody's going to get him to answer that question how you'd rule on roe v. wade in the future, just like justice ginsburg refused to answer 36 times her view of the first amendment, her view of the right of privacy. %$* 176
she wasn't going to bind herself and disqualify herself before she ever got the job. %$* 176
let me turn here to another issue. %$* 597
we only have about 30 seconds or so. %$* 597
yes, ma'am. %$* 176
defense secretary rumsfeld made a surprise visit to baghdad, urging the iraqis to finish their draft constitution before the august 15 deadline. %$* 597
and general george casey said that the u.s. is hopeful that it can bring back a substantial number of troops next spring, summer. %$* 597
how realistic, though, is this, given the situation on the ground? %$* 597
some people are even referring that the situation could tip into a civil war. %$* 597
well, the constitutional process is moving forward. %$* 176
if we get it drafted in august and confirmed in october, it would be historic. %$* 176
it took us 11 years. %$* 176
if they need six more months, so be it. %$* 176
but the idea of coming home too early is off the table. %$* 176
i hope we can bring troops home next spring. %$* 176
but the constitutional process is difficult in america. %$* 176
it's difficult in iraq. %$* 176
taking a 1,400- year-old religious dispute and solving that problem between now and october is tough. %$* 176
but progress is being made. %$* 176
there's all -- every reason to be hopeful that the iraqis are coming together to draft a constitution they can live under. %$* 176
senator lindsey graham, thank you very much for joining us. %$* 597
graham:  thank you. %$* 597
we appreciate it. %$* 597
well, we turn our focus outside of washington in the second edition of "political bytes." %$* 597
in an update to a story we told you about yesterday, san diego surf shop owner and city councilwoman donna frye was the top vote getter in yesterday's special election for mayor. %$* 597
frye, a democrat, received 43 percent of the vote. %$* 597
she now faces a run-off against republican  jerry sanders. %$* 597
frye, who was almost elected to the post last year as a write-in candidate, urged her supporters to return to the polls this fall. %$* 597
need to get engaged in november. %$* 608
this is important. %$* 608
this is -- this is a fight for our city and to return it back to the public. %$* 608
in new england, meantime, the brother of former democratic presidential candidate john kerry is considering his own political run for office. %$* 597
cam kerry says he will run for massachusetts secretary of state if the current secretary leaves to run for governor. %$* 597
cam kerry tells "the boston globe" he is already working with some of his brother's top campaign fund-raisers. %$* 597
the karl rove story is still a hot topic of bloggers. %$* 597
up next, our blog reporters will have the latest from rove's critics and defenders online. %$* 597
bloggers continue to debate the karl rove connection to the cia leak investigation. %$* 597
and for more, we check in with cnn political producer abbi tatton and jacki schechner, our blog reporter -- jacki. %$* 597
hi, lisa. %$* 325
well, there is plenty of information to talk about as the nuggets keep trickling out with regard to the valerie plame investigation. %$* 325
a "washington post" article today now says that special prosecutor patrick fitzgerald's net of people he was going to talk about is much wider than initially thought, that he spoke to people such as george tenet, other cia officials, and also an unnamed stranger who approached bob novak, who is a cnn contributor, by the way, on the street at one point. %$* 325
the left side of the blogosphere taking a very hard look at this today. %$* 325
hullabaloo, this is digbysblog.blogspot.com, pleasantly surprised to read about this new information, not sure what's going to come up of it, everybody a little skeptical at this point, but does say this is evidence of a widening rift between the white house and the cia as to who is really to blame regarding information -- or misinformation, rather, over the appearance of yellow cake uranium. %$* 325
the leftcoaster.com saying exactly the same thing, that, if you come away from this article without seeing that the agency is about to get revenge, then you are not paying attention. %$* 325
so, valerie plame out, more cia-white house in right now. %$* 325
two other smaller stories are getting a little bit of attention on the left and on the right today involving this larger news story. %$* 384
both involve money. %$* 384
valerie plame gave some away, and karl rove might be getting some more. %$* 384
at the stakeholder -- this is the blog of the democratic congressional campaign committee -- they're looking at a pay raise that karl rove is getting, along with other senior white house aides, including scooter libby as well, going up to $161,000. %$* 384
in the comment section there, someone says, well, he's going to have massive legal bills. %$* 384
so he probably needs it. %$* 384
on the right, power line blog is looking at another story. %$* 384
valerie plame, it's reported in "the new york post," gave away $372 as a campaign contribution to a progressive group last year, america coming together. %$* 384
the right has been very interested in the political persuasion of joseph wilson and his wife. %$* 384
over at "the washington monthly," again on the left, kevin drumm is looking into what he thinks is a wider republican p.r. %$* 384
strategy on the karl rove affair, on the valerie plame affair. %$* 384
what he's looking into is -- what they're trying to do is, in his words, diminish the seriousness of outing a cia agent. %$* 384
he's pointing to senator pat roberts, who wants to look into covert status and what he says is, roberts is preemptively defending rove on this one, he's saying preparing the public for something that rove might have done. %$* 384
and the back and forth that often happens on the blogs, pejman yousefzadeh at pejmanesque.com says he's surprised that kevin drumm can read minds, because drumm is a democrat. %$* 325
pejman is a republican. %$* 325
"and he has no idea what the republicans are doing. %$* 325
how is it that kevin could?" %$* 325
we should just make note, he does not want this become a shout fest between him and kevin. %$* 325
that -- he says do not go into his comment section and scream at kevin, so a little bit of warning and little of this civility, but definitely some disagreement. %$* 325
all right, jacki and abbi, thank you very much for your report. %$* 597
and we'll check back with you in just a few minutes. %$* 597
well, you can call it a family affair. %$* 597
timothy flanigan, the president's nominee for deputy attorney general, appeared yesterday before the senate judiciary committee for confirmation hearing. %$* 597
the room was packed largely with flanigan's own family. %$* 597
here's what happened when flanigan's wife stood to make some introductions. %$* 597
let me introduce my children and their spouses, if that's all right. %$* 609
our son patrick and his wife, rapita of, and our two granddaughters, samantha  and jessica , our son james  and his twin brother, timothy, our son -- our daughter elizabeth and her husband dan , our daughter maureen  and her husband, mark severin . %$* 609
and her twin sister is the one who's not available. %$* 609
she's in las vegas -- las vegas. %$* 609
that is most impressive. %$* 21
i thank you. %$* 21
we're not finished yet. %$* 609
our son kevin , our son mark , our son john , our daughter rachel , our daughter molly , and our  twins emily  -- or sarah   melanie  flanigan. %$* 609
did you get all of that? %$* 597
well, if you lost track, that's understandable. %$* 597
we kept count. %$* 597
the flanigans, who are mormons, have 14 children. %$* 597
and 13 of them made it to yesterday's hearing. %$* 597
well, the examination of supreme court nominee john roberts continues. %$* 597
thousands of pages of documents connected to roberts' early government service were released. %$* 597
coming up, our "strategy session" looks at whether they reveal what kind of justice he could be. %$* 597
welcome back to inside politics and our "strategy session" on today's hottest political topics. %$* 597
with us today, democratic strategist paul begala and republican strategist joe watkins. %$* 597
supreme court nominee john roberts continues his charm offensive as thousands of his legal documents are released. %$* 610
the president and vice president head to the hill. %$* 610
it's part of their strategy for dealing with congress/  and the defense secretary heads to iraq as a top american general says improving conditions could bring good news for u.s. troops. %$* 610
but first today, john roberts met with more senators, including republican olympia snow of maine. %$* 610
and the national archives released thousands of justice department papers from the time roberts was a special assistant to the attorney general. %$* 610
included are roberts' arguments on affirmative action and his 1981 advice to then supreme court nominee sandra day o'connor. %$* 610
but first, i just want to say, a point of clarification. %$* 610
which is, earlier i mentioned that with the irs documents that the irs is willing to release a one-page summary of roberts' records. %$* 610
and i said that the white house had refused to. %$* 610
what the white house is telling us is that they just haven't been asked for those records yet. %$* 610
now it gets us into this whole big debate with the records, 15,000 documents. %$* 610
the white house has been essentially been very forthcoming in terms of offering documents. %$* 610
and what do you say? %$* 610
do you think it's a good strategy there. %$* 610
it's a very good strategy. %$* 611
the idea, of course, is to get this nominee confirmed and confirmed in time for the october 3 session. %$* 611
there's no argument here. %$* 611
the whole idea is to lay stuff out on the table for everybody to see it. %$* 611
and for the most part, from a strategic standpoint, democrats initially had a strategy, at least in early july, of trying to attack whoever the nominee was by discounting the fact that the president -- by saying the president probably would not met -- confer with a good number of senators, especially on the other side of the aisle. %$* 611
two, that the nominee would be somebody who was an extremist. %$* 611
and three, that they would not fork over the documents necessary for the senate to really know who this person was. %$* 611
and i think all those things have been satisfied. %$* 611
well, they're essentially taking away some of their punch. %$* 597
do you agree with that, paul? %$* 597
yeah. %$* 506
very smart. %$* 506
they've tried to kill the democrats with kindness. %$* 506
they've cooperated them to death over the prenominee period. %$* 506
the president consulted far more than the constitution requires, very smart, very good for him. %$* 506
they're releasing as you said 15,000 documents. %$* 506
they're drawing a line, though, there's a lot of documents they won't release. %$* 506
they're going to argue that those are documents from when mr. roberts was deputy solicitor general. %$* 506
and was giving legal advice to the president. %$* 506
i have to say i think they're right about that. %$* 506
i worked for the president. %$* 506
i think a president ought to have the right to confidential communications with his staff, something that ken starr and others didn't want president clinton to have, so i'm going to be consistent here. %$* 506
and the right should have belonged to president clinton, it ought to belong to president bush. %$* 506
but it makes it all the more glaring that they won't release his tax returns. %$* 506
they have to. %$* 506
as a political matter. %$* 506
not as a legal matter. %$* 506
candidates for senate, for congress, for dog catcher routinely release tax their returns. %$* 506
and judge roberts has to, as well. %$* 506
he just has to as a political matter so we know, is there any financial conflict of interest or are there any other issues that they raise. %$* 506
and they're going to have to do it. %$* 506
save this tape. %$* 506
he's going to have to release his tax returns. %$* 506
well, you know what they're saying on that, and that's in fact the point i was just clarifying. %$* 597
if you come out and you say the white house is refusing to release these tax records, the white house comes back, you know they call us up and they say no, no, no, no, we're not refusing. %$* 597
they just haven't asked us. %$* 597
is this part of the whole political process? %$* 597
i mean, are we splitting hairs here? %$* 597
what do you think? %$* 597
well, i think that maybe some folks on the other side are looking for something to attack and there really isn't a lot to attack here. %$* 611
this is a person who happens to be liked, well liked on both sides of the aisle. %$* 611
he's worked with people on both sides of the aisle. %$* 611
he really -- and no matter what you say about his political beliefs, whatever they may have within in the past, you have to look at his temperament as a judge and his judicial temperament and philosophy right now i think is one that puts him in good pace to be confirmed by the end of september. %$* 611
one of the conservatives argument on the supreme court is we should listen to the intent of the founding fathers. %$* 506
well, the founding fathers were clear about this. %$* 506
thomas jefferson said when a person accepts a public trust, he becomes public property, meaning you have to disclose everything, and especially on finances. %$* 506
i don't want to see medical records, or what videos he rents. %$* 506
that's too yucky for me. %$* 506
but his finances, the american people have a right to know. %$* 506
let me just jump in really quickly, because i want to read a quote here. %$* 597
this is a memo that was released back from when roberts was in the department of justice back in 1981. %$* 597
quote, "the approach was to avoid giving specific responses to any direct questions on legal issues likely to come up before the court, but demonstrating in the response, a firm command of the subject area and awareness of the relevant precedence and arguments." %$* 597
basically, talk as if you know the subject but don't give anything away. %$* 597
smart strategy or not. %$* 597
what do you say, paul? %$* 597
bad strategy i think. %$* 506
i think they should just tell the truth. %$* 506
i think telling the truth is the best thing. %$* 506
when ruth bader ginsberg was nominated by president clinton to the supreme court in 1993, she was asked by senator brown, then a senator from colorado, about her views on abortion. %$* 506
she didn't say gee, it might come before me. %$* 506
of course it's going to come before her. %$* 506
she didn't talk about a case particular. %$* 506
but she said if a woman doesn't have a right to have an abortion, she's not a fully adult human being. %$* 506
that's what she said. %$* 506
now, that's a pretty -- in some people's eyes, extreme, certainly committed principal position on abortion. %$* 506
she was still confirmed nearly unanimously. %$* 506
judge roberts should say the truth. %$* 506
he thinks abortion is not a constitutional right. %$* 506
and roe versus wade was wrongly decided. %$* 506
that's an honorable position. %$* 506
members of the judiciary committee in the senate have that position. %$* 506
he should just tell you the truth. %$* 506
but i bet you a nickel he won't. %$* 506
you're eating into joe's time right now. %$* 597
we have just a few minutes left. %$* 597
i want to get your insight. %$* 597
well, the question becomes whether or not you want an activist judge on the court. %$* 611
and this president has said he didn't want an activist. %$* 611
he wants somebody who's going to fairly and rightly interpret the constitution of the united states. %$* 611
and how can you say what you're going to do on a given case, especially one that hasn't yet come up before you? %$* 611
i think that judge roberts is doing the right thing. %$* 611
he advised justice o'connor rightly. %$* 611
and i think he's going to do the right thing himself when he's questioned. %$* 611
ok.  joe and paul stay right there. %$* 597
we're going to get back to you in a minute on another topic. %$* 597
well, the president headed to the other end of pennsylvania avenue today. %$* 597
coming up when the "strategy session" continues, president bush's personal appeals to members of congress. %$* 597
what's behind his on-site visit. %$* 597
the "strategy session" continues on inside politics. %$* 597
still here, paul begala and joe watkins. %$* 597
president bush, along with vice president cheney headed to capitol hill this morning to meet with house republicans. %$* 597
and part of the visit was to push for cafta, a free trade agreement with central american nations up for a vote in the house. %$* 597
the face-to-face approach brought very different reactions from the top republican and democrat on the ways and means committee. %$* 597
this is not a major trade vote. %$* 588
it is a major political vote. %$* 588
it's been made a major political vote by the democrats, because they believe there's an opportunity to blunt the thrust of the republican majority and the republican president. %$* 588
it is not about trade. %$* 588
why the president believes that he has to have this win, and the way he's doing it and the heavy-handed way he's carrying this, i don't know. %$* 612
is it the way the war's going? %$* 612
is it karl rove? %$* 612
is it social security? %$* 612
is it his ratings? %$* 612
i have no clue. %$* 612
well, there you heard that. %$* 597
do you agree with what bill thomas is saying, that this is basically a political punch at the president and not about the principals of cafta? %$* 597
i agree with both of them. %$* 506
i agree that -- that bill thomas is right, this is going to be a major political issue. %$* 506
no one is happier to see the president twisting republican arms than the democrats. %$* 506
the democrats think they're going to have a big issue here accusing republicans of shipping jobs overseas with unfair trade deals. %$* 506
that's why charlie rangel was smiling. %$* 506
you know, it was interesting that he points out that republicans are becoming nervous. %$* 506
they're just starting to run away from president bush, because his approval rating is low. %$* 506
the iraq war is unpopular. %$* 506
karl rove is in trouble and carlie's just throwing more kerosene on the fire. %$* 506
so, i love it. %$* 506
he's just brilliant. %$* 506
and joe? %$* 597
well, this is an important one of course. %$* 611
obviously, it's not the largest agreement. %$* 611
you know, 32 billion doesn't make it the largest agreement and i think all of these countries together in the composite would make them the 13th largest trading partner. %$* 611
so, it's not a huge deal in that regard, but certainly going forward, it's important. %$* 611
so, i think the president was very, very smart. %$* 611
i mean, a lot of folks are saying now that the votes are there for this thing to be passed, but the president was very smart, i think, to go to capitol hill, to make a personal appearance; to talk to folks personally. %$* 611
there's no substitute for personal charm and him going to the hill was -- i mean, normally folks come to the white house, but in this case, he went to the hill. %$* 611
i think it was a smart move. %$* 611
does it seem to suggest though, desperation? %$* 597
i mean, for lack of a better word, when you're -- if you've got to have the president personally lobbying? %$* 597
it's not just the pick up the phone and place a phone call to a few select members, this is... %$* 597
well, these votes are important -- these votes are important and so, the president has to pay attention of course and he is. %$* 611
i think he's doing the right thing by going to visit with members of congress and it's good. %$* 611
it shows a president in touch with the members of the house. %$* 611
it shows a president who's asking vulnerable republicans to walk the plank on what joe accurately describes as a relatively minor trade deal. %$* 506
republicans are going to lose seats over this. %$* 506
president bush is not. %$* 506
he's not up for reelection. %$* 506
so, he's going to men and women in who are in vulnerable districts -- not the safe republicans like bill thomas, but there are plenty of republicans being targeted by the democrats who will be harmed politically by this vote and it's the worst position a president can put his party in. %$* 506
my president, bill clinton -- george bush is my president too, but when i worked for bill clinton, we did that to democrats on gun control and other tough issues and it was hard and we lost seats. %$* 506
and i think those republicans need to know tonight, that some of them voting for president bush are going to lose their job because of it. %$* 506
well, a lot just depends, too, on what the people buy; whether or not they buy what republicans are saying. %$* 611
and republicans are saying:  you know what, this is going to create jobs. %$* 611
its is good for these trade barriers to come down. %$* 611
it's going to create new jobs, that's a good thing for the economy and it's good for those central american countries where perhaps, communism and terrorism in the past have wanted to take root. %$* 611
this stops all that stuff. %$* 611
it creates a -- gives them more power, more economic leverage and makes them more viable. %$* 611
and so, it ends up being a good thing for everybody. %$* 611
of course, democrats disagree with that. %$* 611
they're saying, of course, that you lose jobs. %$* 611
does the strategy -- this essentially twisting arms and this personal appeal, does it actually work in the end and do you think that cafta -- bottom line, do you think we'll have a cafta agreement approved when we wake up tomorrow morning? %$* 597
yes, i think it works. %$* 506
i think joe's right. %$* 506
there's nothing like a president looking a member in the eye and saying:  i need you on this. %$* 506
i think it's going to work. %$* 506
i think they're likely to pass it. %$* 506
yes, i think they probably have the votes. %$* 506
they wouldn't be calling the vote if tom delay and the others who run the house didn't think they had the votes. %$* 506
but i'm telling you, the first person who's going to lose his job over cafta is not going to be a textile worker north carolina. %$* 506
it's going to be vulnerable republican congressmen on the ballot in '06. %$* 506
well you know, obviously the deal's been sweetened by some side deals and so, that's something to be considered, as well. %$* 506
but i think this ends up being a good thing. %$* 506
i think it passes and i think that as long as members can share with their constituents what this means for their district -- that is to say jobs -- new jobs and that it's a good thing for the district, then they'll be fine. %$* 506
if the district's in ecuador, but there are not a lot of congressmen from ecuador and guatemala. %$* 506
we'll see what happens and i'll call you both depending on what the results are. %$* 597
so, i'm going to hold you to this. %$* 597
all right. %$* 597
thank you. %$* 597
we'll see you in just a moment, but first, the defense secretary makes another unannounced visit to iraq, at the same time, the top u.s. commander there says there could be a fairly substantial troop withdrawal from iraq. %$* 597
but there are some fairly substantial "ifs" involved. %$* 597
all that when this "strategy session" returns. %$* 597
i'm zain verjee reporting from washington. %$* 613
coming up at the top of the hour:  a big arrest in britain. %$* 613
police think they have the man who tried to bomb the warren street underground station. %$* 613
the pentagon talks about a big troop withdrawal from iraq. %$* 613
we'll tell you how many, how soon. %$* 613
we'll give you a hint, it's likely not at the basketball court. %$* 614
all those stories and much more just minutes away on "wolf blitzer reports." %$* 614
for now though, back to inside politics. %$* 614
this "strategy session" continues on inside politics with paul begala and joe watkins and what could happen in iraq. %$* 597
during an unannounced visit to baghdad by defense secretary donald rumsfeld, the top u.s. commander in iraq said u.s. troops, a lot of them, might head home as early as next spring. %$* 597
what are the chances that some of the estimated 135,000 american troops getting out? %$* 597
general george casey says it depends on a few things. %$* 597
if the political process continues to go positively and if the development of the security forces continues to go as it is going, i do believe we'll still be able to take some fairly substantial reductions after these elections in the spring and summer of next year. %$* 615
that does sound like quite a few ifs:  "if this happens, and if, and if..." %$* 597
very smart to say it that way. %$* 506
that's a lot different than a timetable that's been suggested by some like congressman jones, of course, some weeks ago, suggested that there be a timetable laid out, which, of course, is always a difficult thing to do, because then you telegraph to the enemy -- to people who don't want you to succeed exactly what you're doing and when you're doing it. %$* 506
this is a, i think, a lot smarter approach. %$* 506
it gives hope certainly to the troops. %$* 506
it gives hop to the iraqi people. %$* 506
they're moving forward nicely. %$* 506
they've got elections that are due at the end of the year and if all goes well, if they complete all that stuff, there's a good chance that the transition will be made and that u.s. troops will start to come home. %$* 506
but paul, does it give everyone false hope? %$* 597
in other words:  you put that out there like that and people start thinking: ok, well maybe, you know, relatives can start coming home. %$* 597
how realistic is this even? %$* 597
well, we're getting mixed signals. %$* 506
general casey says this hopeful thing that we'll be able to bring a whole lot of troops home next year, on the very day, as you pointed out, that secretary rumsfeld goes into baghdad under cloak of secrecy. %$* 506
now, we're the liberating power here and our secretary of defense two years after the liberation, still has to hide and sneak around before he can go in, when the ministers from iran, our sworn enemies, go to baghdad, they're treated like heroes. %$* 506
the actions of the defense secretary, who's acting like it's not at all safe there by going there under cloak of secrecy or general casey, who gives us a very hopeful message. %$* 616
i certainly hope casey's right. %$* 616
well, obviously the threat of terror is real everywhere. %$* 611
certainly in the middle east it is, given the sad thing that happened last week in egypt and certainly other threats that have been made. %$* 611
so i think it's smart for any cabinet secretary, any high profile person to not let the folks know, not let the bad guys so to speak, know that they're coming. %$* 611
but isn't it galling -- i say this is as an opponent of war -- isn't it galling that the country that liberated them from saddam hussein has to hide? %$* 506
and the terrorist state of iran can send officials there in the broad daylight and no one -- they don't worry about their security. %$* 506
it says something about the failure of the bush strategy in iraq. %$* 506
well, the good people in iraq are happy that don rumsfeld is there. %$* 611
they're happy that saddam is gone. %$* 611
and that's most of the people in iraq. %$* 611
it's just the insurgents which are pockets of people who disagree with what's happening who want to cause and successfully have caused terror to take place. %$* 611
but those are the insurgents that are keeping the country from moving forward. %$* 597
and do you think... %$* 597
although, it is moving forward. %$* 611
if you listen to what's said here, it always seems like there are problems with the country moving forward. %$* 611
think of all the stuff they've accomplished really in record time just in the last few months. %$* 611
and if they have the elections as planned. %$* 611
and i'm sure it will happen before the end of the year, that's a good thing. %$* 611
that's a very good thing. %$* 611
that's like saying most of the people at ford's theater saw a good play. %$* 506
ok, you know, but they shot lincoln. %$* 506
it was a bad day. %$* 506
i don't mean to diminish what's going on in iraq. %$* 506
but the news that we see on cnn every day is real. %$* 506
and it's a reality for 150,000 american troops. %$* 506
and that's, i think, where the focus is. %$* 506
that's why when general casey says something like this, all of us on both sides of this become hopeful and optimistic. %$* 506
and i just hope it pans out. %$* 506
and final word. %$* 597
we only have a short while. %$* 597
you can get the final word in. %$* 597
my friend, paul. %$* 611
he's so smart. %$* 611
but the truth be told, he's right. %$* 611
paul is actually right. %$* 611
it's a happy day for everybody. %$* 611
this is not a democrat or republican thing. %$* 611
this is an american thing and an iraqi thing and a thing of freedom thing. %$* 611
and obviously, if those troops are able to come home and the transition is made successfully, everybody wins. %$* 611
yes. %$* 597
but first a couple of steps in the way. %$* 597
of course, august 15, the deadline for the new constitution. %$* 597
and then, as you mentioned, the elections later this year. %$* 597
all right, thank you very much. %$* 597
paul begala, joe watkins, thank you very much for joining us. %$* 597
we appreciate the time. %$* 597
thank you. %$* 597
well, just when we thought senator rick santorum was not interested in running for president, the pennsylvania republican appears to be opening the door again. %$* 597
monday, santorum responded to a question during an online chat by saying he did not intend to run for the white house in 2008. %$* 597
but at a breakfast meeting with reporters today, santorum said he would not completely rule out a run for president in '08. %$* 597
he says it would take a strange remote set of circumstances to get him into the race. %$* 597
we'll try to pin santorum down tomorrow when he's a guest on inside politics. %$* 597
a missing person case gets new attention. %$* 597
up next, our blog reporters tell us about a story that received little notice until a blogger got involved. %$* 597
the ranking democrat on the senate foreign relations committee is raising questions about john bolton's stalled nomination to be the ambassador to the u.n.  at issue, whether bolton has testified in the cia leak investigation. %$* 597
and if so, when? %$* 597
senator joe biden cites an msnbc report on july 21 that bolton had testified before the grand jury in the leak case. %$* 597
back in march, bolton filed a committee questionnaire requiring him to state whether he had testified before a grand jury within the past five years. %$* 597
biden is asking secretary of state condoleezza rice to clarify if and when bolton has testified in the leak case. %$* 597
a philadelphia blogger has taken up the case of a missing woman. %$* 597
and now the mystery is receiving new attention. %$* 597
for more, let's rejoin cnn political producer abbi tatton and jacki schechner, our blog reporter -- jacki. %$* 597
hi, lisa. %$* 325
a lot has been said online about how news coverage of missing people focuses very much on missing white women. %$* 325
more so than on nonwhites. %$* 325
well, now there is a missing woman in the philadelphia area and one blogger is using his network of friends and fellow bloggers to get the word out about her. %$* 325
the blogger behind this real push is a philadelphia blogger by the name of richard blair. %$* 617
he blogs at allspinzone.com, which is a blog usually devoted to progressive politics. %$* 617
earlier on in the week, and in fact last friday, richard was listening to local news reports, heard this story, but then over the weekend he saw that it was getting very limited local coverage and almost no national attention at all. %$* 617
he decided to do something about it. %$* 617
he did numerous posts on his site, again allspinzone.com, about the case. %$* 617
he also wrote a letter to cnn's headline news trying to publicize the case. %$* 617
on top of that, he used a mailing list, an e-mail list of his network of progressive bloggers to try and get the word out. %$* 617
he says this is something that bloggers do sparingly, but he sent out this post saying this is a very important story. %$* 617
i want you all to blog about it, all to follow it. %$* 617
and it really seems to have worked. %$* 617
richard considers himself a mid tier political blog. %$* 325
and now he has gotten traction from some of the much larger blogs, including escaton. %$* 325
that is duncan black's atrios.blogspot.com. %$* 325
he is by far the largest progressive political blog in the philadelphia area. %$* 325
he has linked back to the all spin zone. %$* 325
that will definitely help the traffic to that. %$* 325
also, richard has posted in a diary at dailykos.com, that one of the top liberal blogs also getting more than half a million hits a day from what we understand. %$* 325
but you don't have to be a giant blog to help. %$* 325
and there are a lot of local philadelphia blogs who are chiming in right now. %$* 325
and we like this over at the smedley blog, basically saying you don't have giant readership in order to help out. %$* 325
just put the photograph on your blog, post a little bit of information, track back to the all spin zone. %$* 325
even if it's one or two people that read your blog, that's one or two more people out there who can really put her face on the story. %$* 325
and maybe help to find her. %$* 325
but the idea is not just publicity for blair. %$* 384
what he's trying to fund raise, to get money for a reward fund, hoping that more people will come ahead with information. %$* 384
he looked at a local citizen's crime group that was looking at this story, as well and saw that they will had a fundraising drive going, but no way to raise money online. %$* 384
so what he did was work with them to invite people to his site in order to donate directly from his web site using his paypal account. %$* 384
he had been fundraising for his own blog, his quarterly fundraising drive, but he gave that up on saturday to help this effort to help this missing woman. %$* 384
back to you, lisa. %$* 384
keeping us informed on the blogs. %$* 597
thank you very much. %$* 597
well, that's it for inside politics. %$* 597
i'm lisa sylvester. %$* 597
wolf blitzer report starts right now. %$* 597

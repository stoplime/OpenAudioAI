president bush puts the work into his working vacation, taking to the road to tout his legislative achievements. %$* 116
i'll be signing next week a comprehensive energy bill and it's a good piece of legislation. %$* 161
we'll take a look mr. bush's victories and setbacks. %$* 116
... that this is a very lethal and unfortunately, adaptive enemy that we are faced with inside iraq. %$* 157
a very deadly week for u.s. forces. %$* 116
will the violence over there impact the politics back here? %$* 116
an iraq war veteran almost pulls off an amazing upset in ohio. %$* 116
there's nothing to cry about here. %$* 496
this was a success. %$* 496
we should all be proud. %$* 496
so, let's rock on. %$* 496
is yesterday's special election a bellwether for next year's battle for control of congress? %$* 116
john roberts responds. %$* 116
the supreme court nominee answers questions posed by senators, but what do his replies reveal? %$* 116
now live from washington, cnn's inside politics. %$* 116
thanks for joining us. %$* 360
i'm joe johns. %$* 360
president bush kicked off his month-long stay in texas today with a speech highlighting the early accomplishments of his second term. %$* 360
in remarks to state lawmakers he offered a progress report on everything from the just-passed energy and highway bills, to the upcoming battle over his supreme court nominee. %$* 360
he also talked about the recent violence in iraq, calling it a grim reminder of the enemies facing america. %$* 360
cnn's elaine quijano is traveling with the president. %$* 360
on his first full day of a nearly five-week long working vacation, president bush touted his second-term legislative accomplishments. %$* 478
and finally, after years of work, i'm proud to announce i'll be signing next week, a comprehensive energy bill. %$* 161
besides an energy bill, he put a highway bill and the central american free trade agreement in his win column. %$* 478
the president also claimed progress on the economic front. %$* 478
employment is up in 48 of the 50 states. %$* 161
unemployment is down to 5 percent. %$* 161
yet the president has not been able to claim victory on what was supposed to have been the signature legislative agenda item of his second term -- changing social security -- despite his hard sell on the issue. %$* 478
the system is going broke, is what is the problem. %$* 161
president bush ran with two major priorities, sweeping domestic changes he wanted to implement. %$* 497
number one, social security; number two, tax reform. %$* 497
social security is in worse shape now than it was when the president was inaugurated in january in terms of getting any traction. %$* 497
and last week, another political setback for president bush. %$* 478
the senate majority leader bill frist broke with the president, expressing support for expanding federal funding of embryonic stem cell research. %$* 478
and of course, joe, president bush has threatened to veto any legislation that will do that -- joe? %$* 478
and apparently even in the face of all of that, he is still standing by that veto threat, right, elaine? %$* 360
that's correct. %$* 478
the president was asked about this during an interview with texas newspapers recently and the president essentially said that his position, the one that he outlined back in 2001 -- in august of 2001, that the existing stem cell lines at that time should be the only ones receiving federal funding. %$* 478
he has not changed from that position, the president, saying that he is confident that he has achieved, quote, "the right balance between science and ethics," unquote, not appearing to be swayed at all by senator frist's position -- joe? %$* 478
sticking by his guns. %$* 360
thanks so much, elaine quijano. %$* 360
president bush also used today's speech to comment on the situation in iraq. %$* 360
he stuck to familiar themes, pledging that the u.s. will remain in iraq until the mission is complete and that it would be a mistake to set a timetable for withdrawal. %$* 360
fourteen marines died in a roadside bombing near the iraqi town of haditha in the euphrates river valley. %$* 360
the marines belonged to the same ohio battalion that lost six members just two days ago. %$* 360
mr. bush told his audience that the u.s. forces who have died in battle will not be forgotten. %$* 360
men and women who lost their lives in iraq and afghanistan and in this war on terror, have died in a noble cause and a selfless cause. %$* 161
their families can know that american citizens pray for them. %$* 161
and the families can know that we will honor their loved one's sacrifice by completing the mission. %$* 161
with me now to talk more about the situation in iraq and other issues is senator george allen of virginia. %$* 360
he joins me from capitol hill. %$* 360
thanks so much, senator allen, for speaking with me. %$* 360
eighteen hundred u.s. lives lost over there now. %$* 360
there are some suggestions that the attacks are becoming fewer but more lethal. %$* 360
what's the strategy? %$* 360
and do you think there is a real possibility for at least some of the troops to start coming home as early as next year? %$* 360
well, i think you are going to have to look at several factors and progress and benchmarks in the future. %$* 488
i think, first of all, we'll be able to have our troops stand down as iraqis are able to stand up and protect themselves. %$* 488
on the political front, one of the key things will be this constitution. %$* 488
if they can get this constitution drafted -- and one that respects individual rights, that rights are not enhanced nor diminished on the account of religious beliefs or because of one's gender or ethnicity -- and have the rule of law and justice there, i think they have a good shot at it -- and, of course, the ratification of that constitution by the people in elections. %$* 488
that's the political front. %$* 488
on the security front, obviously training more iraqis to take care of their own country will be essential. %$* 488
the electricity, the water, the sewer, oil production being improved -- all of those will be important, as well as in the schools, by the way, teaching educational, academic subjects rather than hate. %$* 488
i think there's progress, but it is very, very difficult, whether it's the constitution or whether that is the training of iraqis. %$* 488
the terrorists, whether they are remnants of saddam's regime or whether they are al qaeda, these people do not have any other motive other than to wreak havoc and cause trouble. %$* 488
but i don't think that's going to win the hearts and minds of iraqis. %$* 488
but... %$* 488
senator, it does... %$* 360
i'm positive, i'm optimistic, but recognize that this is going to be very difficult and a treacherous land. %$* 488
it does seem as though the administration continues to have problems with public relations on these issues. %$* 360
do you think there's anything the administration should be doing that it hasn't been doing with regard to p.r. %$* 360
? %$* 360
well, to the extent that you all with cnn or any others can talk about some of the positive things in areas that are safe, that would be helpful. %$* 488
i'm not going to criticize the media, though. %$* 488
when you have the tragic killing of 14 americans, naturally that's going to -- and understandably that's going to -- get attention. %$* 488
but there is progress. %$* 488
and i think that there will be certain benchmarks with a constitution that i think people will see an uptick, let's say, in support and understanding just like on june -- excuse me, in late january -- when the iraqis voted, that got americans feeling positive about progress. %$* 488
and people want to see those sort of benchmarks. %$* 488
and when they occur, i think there will be more support. %$* 488
and i think most americans realize this is tough. %$* 488
we're going to have to persevere. %$* 488
but, most of all, we want to see the iraqis taking control of their own destiny and their own security. %$* 488
so, senator, now quickly, let's talk a little bit about domestic politics. %$* 488
you have certainly been mentioned as one of those people who might be running for the white house next time around. %$* 488
where do you stand on that? %$* 488
what, running for the white house? %$* 488
yes. %$* 360
is that what you're saying, joe? %$* 488
i'm running for re-election next year, is my political focus right now. %$* 488
i have been encouraged by many outstanding individuals for whom i have a great deal of respect, who had worked, for example, in the reagan administration. %$* 488
so i'm going to keep advocating the advancement of freedom and making sure this country is the world capital of innovation, with better tax policies and better education, so that we are leaders, no matter what position i'm in. %$* 488
now, when the congress returns, obviously, one of the big things the senate will be focusing on is the roberts nomination for the supreme court. %$* 360
you met with judge roberts. %$* 360
what's your assessment of him? %$* 360
allen: well, i very much enjoyed talking with judge roberts. %$* 360
we had a good conversation, maybe 45 minutes. %$* 360
he's a scholar, a legal scholar. %$* 360
but you know the good thing about him? %$* 360
he doesn't talk like a lawyer. %$* 360
he clearly understands the law. %$* 360
what i care most about, is judges who understand their responsibility is to apply the law, not invent the law. %$* 360
he understands the constitution and that the constitution should not be amended by judicial decree. %$* 360
and we talked about things such as precedent and how important that is, but when precedent might not be ultimately controlling and stultifying. %$* 360
asked him about how you protect individual rights, how you interpret state laws, when the federal government should or should not be taking over the rights and prerogatives of the people in the states, and a variety of other issues. %$* 360
but i came away from it feeling that he was well-grounded, has the right judicial philosophy. %$* 360
i think he'll be an outstanding member of the supreme court. %$* 360
moreover, on the supreme court i think that he'll be one that will be able to persuade other justices to his point of view. %$* 360
and some of that's just his demeanor. %$* 360
and i like the fact that he cuts his own grass. %$* 360
another issue that you have been heavily involved with is the issue of stem cell research. %$* 360
we've already talked about it on the program just a little bit. %$* 360
what's your view? %$* 360
is the administration going to be able to sidestep a confrontation with the republican congress on this issue? %$* 360
probably not. %$* 488
every senator is going to come up to this, and whatever number of bills, i don't know how many different proposals we'll ultimately have before us in the senate, maybe six or eight. %$* 488
what i'm looking to do is find a way that we can advance stem cell research in a way that it actually helps people. %$* 488
and of course adult stem cell research right now is finding cures and helping people. %$* 488
so far as the embryonic stem cell research, there are three filters that i'm using. %$* 488
one is the scientific advancement filter. %$* 488
the other is, what is appropriate for federal funding? %$* 488
the third is the ethical or the ethics controversy. %$* 488
i think with some of the advancements in technology and science, there are ways of deriving stem cells, embryonic-type stem cells, that have all that flexibility and pluripotentiality without destroying an embryo. %$* 488
if we can do that, that's good for science. %$* 488
it's logical for funding. %$* 488
it also avoids the ethical controversy. %$* 488
and the fact of the matter is that the question is whether or not there should be federal funding. %$* 488
and it's not as if the federal government is the only one who can fund this. %$* 488
the state of california has put in $3 billion for such research, as have other states and the private sector. %$* 488
so maybe if we can find and craft a measure which gets embryonic stem cells without destroying an embryo, that is the plus-plus approach for advancements in the research in stem cells to help from everything from juvenile diabetes to alzheimer's and parkinson's. %$* 488
senator george allen of virginia, thanks so much for joining us. %$* 360
let's stay in touch during august. %$* 360
ok. will do. %$* 488
you bet. %$* 360
more on john roberts in his own words, straight ahead. %$* 360
a first look at roberts' views of the role of judges, his judicial philosophy, even his favorite football team. %$* 360
and it's never too early to take a poll. %$* 360
with planning for 2008 already in progress, we'll tell you how americans view giuliani, mccain and hillary clinton. %$* 360
and later, senator bill frist takes a stand on stem cell research and appears to get passed over for an encore appearance at judicial sunday. %$* 360
as we mentioned, supreme court nominee john roberts has responded to a senate questionnaire with more information about his private and professional life. %$* 360
senators are expected to use the information during roberts' confirmation hearings next month, but so far, several key questions remain unanswered. %$* 360
it reads like an application for membership to an exclusive club, which the supreme court is in a way. %$* 370
questions from the senate judiciary committee to supreme court nominee john roberts, covering seemingly every aspect of his life. %$* 370
we learn roberts was phi beta kappa, had no military service, later joined a tony country club. %$* 370
he speaks in generalizations, so there's nothing really that anybody can pick up on and complain about. %$* 498
he acknowledged press reports stating he was a member of the federalist society, a conservative legal group, but claimed he had no recollection of ever being formally in the organization. %$* 360
what many lawmakers really wanted, what the judge thinks about hot button issues like abortion and the death penalty. %$* 360
here roberts was not asked for specifics and didn't offer any. %$* 360
instead, he outlined a general conservative judicial philosophy. %$* 360
judges, he said, must have a limited role. %$* 360
"they do not have a commission to solve society's problems as they see them, but simply to decide cases before them according to the rule of law." %$* 360
roberts said legal precedents like roe versus wade, were important -- quote -- "to promoting stability of the legal system." %$* 360
several abortion rights groups criticize the lack of specifics, but legal experts say upcoming hearings could prove more fruitful. %$* 360
we can anticipate, as he did, that he's going to say that precedent is very important. %$* 498
but he's not going to say that it's necessarily controlling in every case. %$* 498
and i think 99 percent of the judges in this country would agree with that. %$* 498
the devil is in the details, as it always is. %$* 498
there is also little to learn from roberts' legal work for george w. bush during the 2000 florida recount. %$* 360
court sources have said he was a key behind-the-scenes player, helping draft all the important legal appeals on which the presidency would turn. %$* 360
but roberts would only acknowledge spending a week in tallahassee at the request of gop lawyers, helping governor jeb bush, the future president's brother. %$* 360
as for money, roberts has plenty. %$* 360
he lists his net worth at $5.3 million, including a big house in an exclusive washington suburb, lucrative stock investments, with a portfolio that includes time warner, parent of cnn. %$* 360
we have also learned a little about the selection process roberts went through. %$* 360
he met first with attorney general gonzales april 1, a month later with a group including vice president cheney and deputy chief of staff karl rove. %$* 360
this was weeks before justice sandra day o'connor decided to retire. %$* 360
after that news, white house contacts with roberts intensified, culminating with the july 15 meeting with president bush that sealed the nomination. %$* 360
john roberts also spoke out today on a matter close to the hearts of washingtonians, their redskins football team. %$* 360
the matter came up as roberts appeared at a photo op with senator george allen, who just appeared, whose father was a former redskins coach. %$* 360
asked if he was a redskins fan, roberts replied, sure, but added the caveat that he grew up a fan of the buffalo bills and still has loyalties there. %$* 360
on the baseball front, roberts refused to reveal his loyalties between the washington nationals or the baltimore orioles, saying, i'm not going there. %$* 360
are you ready for the next race for the white house? %$* 360
it's still three years away, but that's not stopping pollsters from asking voters who they favor. %$* 360
we've got results just ahead. %$* 360
it may be the dog days of summer, but that's not stopping pollsters from turning their sights to the next battle for the white house in 2008. %$* 360
the names might not surprise you -- clinton and mccain, to mention a couple -- but the results might. %$* 360
here's our bruce morton. %$* 360
fish got to swim, birds got to fly. %$* 321
pollsters got to poll, too, even when they're looking way down the road. %$* 321
so ok, voters, pretend it's 2008 and it's senator hillary clinton for the democrats and rudy giuliani for the republicans. %$* 321
registered voters told gallup, rudy wins by five points. %$* 321
how about hillary clinton against senator john mccain? %$* 321
he wins by the same margin. %$* 321
giuliani and/or mccain against john kerry? %$* 321
they win even bigger. %$* 321
but hey, the 2008 election is more than three years off. %$* 321
does this poll mean anything? %$* 321
it's like trying to predict who's going to win the super bowl in 2008. %$* 499
you know, the season hasn't started yet. %$* 499
the pre-season hasn't started yet. %$* 499
training camp hasn't started yet. %$* 499
we don't know who the players are going to be, we don't know who the teams are going to be. %$* 499
gallup also asks about favorable and unfavorable opinions of these people now, today. %$* 321
americans have a favorable opinion of giuliani, of senator clinton, of senator mccain. %$* 321
the only guys with negative marks are the two who ran last time, president bush and democrat john kerry. %$* 321
the poll didn't ask about other wannabes, delaware democratic senator joe biden, for example. %$* 321
well, i'm going out to see whether or not anybody but me thinks i should be president. %$* 89
and on "the daily show," he raised an interesting possibility. %$* 321
you may end up going against a senate colleague, perhaps mccain, perhaps frist? %$* 20
john mccain is a personal friend, a great friend, and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain, because i think the country would be better off -- be well off no matter who... %$* 89
mccain/biden? %$* 321
biden/mccain? %$* 321
a fusion ticket? %$* 321
haven't seen that since republican abe lincoln ran with democrat andrew johnson in 1864. %$* 321
they won, of course, but then lincoln was murdered and johnson was impeached. %$* 321
maybe not such a good precedent, after all. %$* 321
bruce morton, cnn, washington. %$* 321
there's more news about the potential 2008 hopefuls in our "political bytes." %$* 360
senate majority leader bill frist was the featured speaker at the first justice sunday event, but he was not invited to justice sunday ii, which is being held in his home state of tennessee. %$* 360
justice sunday is a televised event aimed at promoting conservative judicial appointees. %$* 360
senator frist recently split with religious conservatives over the issue of stem cell research. %$* 360
house majority leader tom delay will be the featured speaker at justice sunday ii. %$* 360
massachusetts governor mitt romney looks ready to improve his foreign policy credentials. %$* 360
romney plans to travel to israel next month for his first international trip as governor. %$* 360
the trip is officially billed as a trade mission. %$* 360
it is being arranged by the american israel public affairs committee, a powerful washington lobbying group. %$* 360
still ahead, do the results of a special election in ohio foreshadow how the war in iraq could play out in next year's midterm races? %$* 360
and john roberts answers a questionnaire from the judiciary committee. %$* 360
did he give any more hints on when he thinks it's right for the high court to step in? %$* 360
as the markets get set to close on wall street, i'm joined by christine romans in new york with "the dobbs report" -- christine. %$* 360
hi, there, joe. %$* 369
just a little bit less than two minutes to go to the closing bell and stocks are little changed here. %$* 369
the big move was in the oil market today. %$* 369
right now, the dow industrials up 14 points, 10,697, but the nasdaq just slightly lower. %$* 369
now oil prices fell a dollar. %$* 369
that decline followed a report that showed crude oil inventories actually rose last week. %$* 369
reebok outran the rest of the market shares, soaring 13 bucks or 30 percent today. %$* 369
the german sneaker-maker adidas will buy reebok for nearly $4 billion. %$* 369
adidas wants to be in a better position to compete with nike. %$* 369
nike is the industry leader, with 36 percent of the u.s. sneaker market. %$* 369
adidas and reebok together would hold about 21 percent. %$* 369
time warner will pay $2.4 billion to settle shareholder lawsuits over its disastrous merger with aol. %$* 369
the money will go to investors who bought shares of aol or time warner from 1999 to 2002. %$* 369
the world's largest media company and cnn's parent also lost more than $300 million in the most recent quarter. %$* 369
to buck up its share price, time warner plans to buy back up to $5 billion worth of its own stock during the next couple of years. %$* 369
in other news, the 30-year bond is back. %$* 369
the treasury department will start selling the bonds again next year, after a four-year hiatus. %$* 369
the sales would help finance our national debt. %$* 369
the 30-year bond is known as a low risk, long-term investment option. %$* 369
00 p.m. eastern on lou dobbs tonight, china's cnooc has withdrawn its $18 billion bid for unocal, but that doesn't mean communist china is giving up its aggressive push to snap up american assets. %$* 412
this is going to go forward at a pace. %$* 500
the united states simply can no longer afford not to view these things strategically and be devising its own strategy to respond. %$* 500
also tonight, the latest from iraq. %$* 369
another deadly bomb attack kills 14 marines. %$* 369
still, former marine corps colonel thomas -- thomas hammes says the u.s. must not change course. %$* 369
he'll be our guest. %$* 369
plus, a risky and historic repair mission in space. %$* 369
we'll have a full report on that. %$* 369
and investigative reporter and author paul sperry tells us why he thinks racial profiling is a good way to hunt for terrorists in the united states. %$* 369
00 eastern. %$* 501
join us, lou dobbs tonight -- joe. %$* 501
thanks, christine. %$* 360
now back to inside politics. %$* 360
the outcome of yesterday's special election for ohio's 2nd district house seat is not in dispute, but the loser and his party are still claiming victory. %$* 360
republican jean schmidt got 52 percent of the vote to defeat democrat paul hackett in an area that tilts heavily republican. %$* 360
cnn's senior political analyst, bill schneider, has more on the surprisingly tight election that caught national attention and why democrats see signs of better things to come. %$* 360
the republican won. %$* 317
no one would think we would become the focus of the national media or become the so-called first test of the republican party and the bush mandate. %$* 502
well, ladies and gentlemen, we passed the test. %$* 502
barely, which is why the democrats are celebrating. %$* 317
there's nothing to cry about here. %$* 496
this was a success. %$* 496
we should all be proud. %$* 496
so let's rock on. %$* 496
this nonpartisan analyst agrees. %$* 317
the losers have more to celebrate than the winners. %$* 317
i think it was a moral victory for them. %$* 487
ohio's 2nd congressional district is one of the reddest districts in the country, 64 percent for bush last year. %$* 317
but when the republican margin slips to 52 percent, the gop could have a problem. %$* 317
the democrat, paul hackett, an iraq war veteran, was running as a critic of president bush's war policy. %$* 317
whoa, whoa, whoa, you told us a year-and-a-half ago mission accomplished. %$* 496
it's a hell of a lot worse there today. %$* 496
suddenly, the race looked interesting. %$* 317
both national parties threw a lot of money into this race and ratcheted up the attention. %$* 487
especially after hackett attacked president bush personally. %$* 317
republicans expected to see a backlash against hackett. %$* 317
it didn't happen. %$* 317
you expect lower turnout in a mid-summer special election, but the gop lost almost five times as many votes as the democrats. %$* 317
why? %$* 317
here's a clue. %$* 317
the latest national gallup poll shows only 48 percent of americans with a favorable personal opinion of bush, down from 60 percent last november. %$* 317
that's the lowest personal rating bush has ever gotten. %$* 317
"if the war's conduct resonates so strongly in the 2nd district, its echo is likely to be even louder in the rest of the country next year if our involvement in iraq is unabated." %$* 503
elections are accountability moments, and we don't have too many of them going on right now. %$* 487
so, whenever they happen, they do get the attention of politicians and journalists. %$* 487
this one certainly did. %$* 317
according to mr. cook, republican losses were especially large in the poorer, more rural areas of that district. %$* 317
those were the kinds of voters who delivered ohio for president bush last year. %$* 317
near portsmouth, ohio, and around the bend there. %$* 360
that's right. %$* 317
johns: so, is this the kind of thing that creates pressure, more pressure, for example, for the president and the administration to start talking about some type of a timetable for at least a few troops from iraq? %$* 317
it puts pressure on congressional republicans to talk about that kind of timetable. %$* 317
you've seen some movement by republicans in congress to say, we need a timetable. %$* 317
we want to start the withdrawal process. %$* 317
the administration has resisted. %$* 317
you're going to see more congressional republicans start putting pressure. %$* 317
they want a timetable in place before november 2006. %$* 317
thanks so much, bill schneider. %$* 360
with me now from cincinnati is the winner of yesterday's special election in ohio, jean schmidt, the republican. %$* 360
thanks for joining us. %$* 360
thank you for having me on. %$* 502
i guess we ought to start at the beginning here. %$* 360
a lot of people -- you heard bill just a moment ago -- have called this a referendum on iraq in large part. %$* 360
is that how you see it? %$* 360
no. %$* 502
first off, this was a special election. %$* 502
and the dynamics in a special election are not a bellwether for regular elections. %$* 502
the second thing that i think that the national media is missing is that my opponent, understanding the popularity of the president in this district, actually in his ads painted himself as someone who supported the president. %$* 502
so, you're -- you're missing a larger picture in this district. %$* 502
but he's also someone who called the president a bunch of names as well. %$* 360
at least, that's what i've heard. %$* 360
do you think that he simply went too far in the race and there was a backlash? %$* 360
when he was making those name-callings, it was in the national press, not in the local press. %$* 502
and with a very short window of opportunity for the voters of this district to get to know either candidate, it was very, very easy to do a smoke-and-mirrors kind of a thing, for him to paint himself as a republican. %$* 502
in fact, there were republicans in this district, when they saw his ad, that thought he was the republican candidate. %$* 502
nowhere in his ads did he ever say democrat. %$* 502
the second thing is, is that you have to look at the uniqueness of this election. %$* 502
in june, there were 11 of us that ran on the republican ticket. %$* 502
and there was a front-runner that the people in this district had a passion about, either a love or a hate relationship. %$* 502
and for those that loved him, they voted for him. %$* 502
but, for the rest, they were looking at the other 10 candidates as their choice. %$* 502
once that election was over, the passion and the energy for the august election waned. %$* 502
they thought, because this had always been a very easy race, that there really was no reason to go back to the polls. %$* 502
they misunderstood the fact that, in the past 20 years, the democrats have not mounted a candidate like mr. hackett. %$* 502
and the democrats have never put as much money into the race as they did with mr. hackett. %$* 502
and so those were some of the unique features of it. %$* 502
the other thing that i think that you've missed when i heard your analyst is the whole issue of the scioto county. %$* 502
if you understand scioto county, while it appears in part to look more republican- leaning, those independent voters are actually democrats. %$* 502
i have worked on the ground with local campaigns out in scioto county in the last four years, and i can tell you, even though it looks as an index as a republican district, once you get off the presidential platform, the national platform and you get into the local, they tend to vote democratic. %$* 502
now, of course, the democrats, the day after, are saying the closeness of this race really indicates there's no safe republican district in this country. %$* 360
and they're saying this basically because of the iraq war. %$* 360
do you buy that? %$* 360
obviously not. %$* 360
no, i really don't. %$* 502
the iraq war is, of course, an important issue, and the voters of this district recognize that. %$* 502
but when i was talking to them over the last four months, the things that they were talking about when we talked about national security was that they wanted to keep the course going, but they also wanted to protect the borders. %$* 502
border patrol is a very serious issue here. %$* 502
they also wanted to talk about the president's tax policy. %$* 502
they wanted to keep the tax cuts permanent, because it puts real money into the hands of real individuals. %$* 502
they want to eliminate the death tax, the capital gains tax, and the alternative minimum tax. %$* 502
and they want a sound energy policy that moves us away from foreign oil and on to a domestic supply, including drilling in the anwr, taking a look at our refineries and boosting those, and looking at short-term solutions, such as a renewable policy that has an ethanol component, as well as long-term renewable solutions. %$* 502
so, these were the things that i was hearing time and time again in the district. %$* 502
the national media was trying to focus on the war. %$* 502
one last question. %$* 360
one last question. %$* 360
just wanted to jump in. %$* 360
sure. %$* 502
a lot of people have tried to link you to the ethics problems of the governor there in ohio. %$* 360
what do you think? %$* 360
did that have an effect on the race? %$* 360
my opponent tried to malign my character in a very unfair way by painting a very broad brush that anybody that served in the house of representatives suddenly was tied to bob taft. %$* 502
it was -- it was a very unfair portrayal of me. %$* 502
he did it the last two weeks of the campaign, very little time for me to actually respond to it. %$* 502
again, with the uniqueness of this race, the quickness of this race, allowed him to do a smoke-and-mirrors approach. %$* 502
i would caution anyone on either side to look at this race as a bellwether for the republican party or democratic party, because it was a special race. %$* 502
special unique features were going into this that will not be in place in a general election. %$* 502
jean schmidt, thank you so much. %$* 360
we'll see you up here in washington. %$* 360
you bet. %$* 502
thank you so much. %$* 502
the fighting mad senator from west virginia. %$* 360
coming up, robert byrd firing back at republicans trying to block his bid to win a ninth term on the hill. %$* 360
the ohio congressional election. %$* 360
our blog reporters are standing by with a look at the online reaction to the surprising results. %$* 360
and the president's working vacation, all five weeks of it. %$* 360
we'll get paul begala and vicky clarke's take on it in our "strategy session." %$* 360
as we mentioned, a republican won the special congressional election in ohio yesterday, but democrats are celebrating, too. %$* 360
former state lawmaker jean schmidt is headed for capitol hill following her narrow defeat of iraq war veteran paul hackett. %$* 360
but hackett supporters are kicking up their heels because their man came ever so close to winning in a major republican stronghold. %$* 360
joining me now with his take on this, cnn political analyst stu rothenberg. %$* 360
stu, thanks for coming in. %$* 360
sure, john. %$* 318
why was this so close? %$* 360
well, i think there are a number of reasons. %$* 318
hard to identify any single reason, a number of factors. %$* 318
one, the republican candidate, jean schmidt, was an accidental nominee. %$* 318
the only reason she won the republican primary is the top two republicans destroyed each other. %$* 318
she came through and ended up running a very amateurish campaign. %$* 318
she refused to attack hackett, the democrat, didn't make this a liberal-conservative, republican- democratic race, just talked about her personality. %$* 318
not enough. %$* 318
second, the republican situation in ohio is disastrous at the moment. %$* 318
governor bob taft's job approval is 19 percent. %$* 318
the state republican party is fending off charges every day -- every day, ethics charges about the administration. %$* 318
and the democratic congressional campaign committee came in with a terrific ad right at the end linking schmidt and taft. %$* 318
i think that's -- those are -- that's the main reason why the race was so close. %$* 318
so, is this really a bellwether, though? %$* 360
well, it may be for a bellwether for ohio republicans. %$* 318
i'm -- that is, this is a siren, warning siren, for them. %$* 318
in terms of president bush and national, the republicans for 2006, i think we have to be very cautious. %$* 318
taft was such a lightning rod here. %$* 318
schmidt ran such a horrendous campaign. %$* 318
she really didn't use president bush effectively. %$* 318
and, in fact, the democrats didn't make this about bush. %$* 318
they wanted to make it about the governor. %$* 318
so, the president's national numbers are weak. %$* 318
and this could -- certainly, the cycle could develop. %$* 318
ethics could be an issue that the democrats use over the whole cycle. %$* 318
but i think we can't read too much about bush into this special election. %$* 318
want to talk about a couple other senate races for the '06 midterms. %$* 360
we're hearing a little bit of news about katherine harris, that race in florida. %$* 360
what's going on? %$* 360
that's right. %$* 318
well, alan bense, the speaker of the state house, who has been heavily recruited by national republican strategists, the republican senate campaign committee, has announced he will not run. %$* 318
that leaves katherine harris as the 800-pound gorilla in the race. %$* 318
one congressman, mark foley, is still mentioned, still says he's considering. %$* 318
but, with bense out, it looks like harris is going to be the nominee. %$* 318
a lot of national republicans have been, let's say, lukewarm in their enthusiasm about her. %$* 318
they wonder about her electability. %$* 318
that's been their major concern. %$* 318
it's -- they don't have any other problems with her. %$* 318
they are just not sure she can win. %$* 318
but if she becomes the nominee, they're going to have to get behind her. %$* 318
florida is a competitive state. %$* 318
the republicans can't not play in florida. %$* 318
not too far from pennsylvania, west virginia, where the tv ads are already flying, apparently. %$* 360
senator byrd hasn't even made his announcement official yet for reelection. %$* 360
right. %$* 318
right. %$* 318
both sides -- both sides are in that race. %$* 318
the republican senate committee ran a tv spot talking about how senator byrd had changed, how he was this conservative democrat and now he's a liberal democrat. %$* 318
the byrd people fired back. %$* 318
there is a good deal of animosity in this race already, even though the republicans don't have a top-tier contender. %$* 318
the republicans -- the democrats fired back. %$* 318
byrd fired back, talking about outside interests who want to privatize social security, interfering in west virginia politics. %$* 318
this is a -- it's a remarkably nasty race. %$* 318
and people are very emotionally involved in a number of these contests, whether it's florida, as we started with, west virginia, or pennsylvania, as you alluded to, where the santorum-casey race is -- looks to be a very tough contest for the republicans. %$* 318
stu rothenberg, thanks so much. %$* 360
sure. %$* 318
and we'll be in touch. %$* 360
we continue our focus on 2006 in today's second edition of "political bytes." %$* 360
a new poll finds new york senator hillary clinton leading a potential gop challenger by a wide margin. %$* 360
the quinnipiac university survey gives clinton a 34-point lead over westchester county district attorney jeanine pirro. %$* 360
word of clinton's lead comes as pirro continues to consider campaigns for governor or state attorney general, as well as the 2006 senate race. %$* 360
a spokesman today denied a report that pirro had ruled out a senate campaign. %$* 360
west virginia's longtime democratic senator robert byrd is firing back at republicans with a new tv ad in his home state. %$* 360
the ad defends byrd against what it calls out-of-state special interests that are running -- quote -- "false attack ads." %$* 360
a spot paid for by the national republican senatorial committee that started airing in west virginia last week criticizes byrd as out of touch with the state's voters. %$* 360
republicans are aggressively recruiting a candidate to challenge his attempt to win a ninth senate term. %$* 360
and detroit mayor kwame kilpatrick came in second among a dozen candidates yesterday in his bid for reelection. %$* 360
he now faces a november 8 runoff against freman hendrix, the city's former deputy mayor, who was the top vote-getter in yesterday's primary. %$* 360
and billionaire financier political activist george soros has apparently decided to pull the plug on america coming together. %$* 360
that's the group that soros poured tens of millions of dollars into last year as part of his effort to defeat president bush. %$* 360
the "washington post" reports the group has notified its employees that their august paychecks will be their last. %$* 360
the blogosphere phenomenon appears to be growing by leaps and bounds, but is it? %$* 360
up next, our blog reporters with all the details of the state of the blogosphere report. %$* 360
there's a new development in the baseball steroid scandal. %$* 360
the top two representatives of the house government reform committee are calling on major league baseball to turn all documents over relating to the positive tests of baltimore orioles star rafael palmeiro. %$* 360
on monday, baseball officials announced that palmeiro was being suspended for 10 days for using steroids. %$* 360
palmeiro testified in march to the committee that he had never used steroids. %$* 360
making false statements to congress is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison. %$* 360
in a statement, palmeiro said he will cooperate fully with the committee and release any information needed. %$* 360
as we mentioned, the results of the special congressional election in ohio was full of surprises. %$* 360
and it's getting a lot of attention in the blogosphere. %$* 360
we check in now with cnn political producer abbi tatton and jacki schechner, our blog reporter -- jacki. %$* 360
hi, joe. %$* 325
well, as we heard earlier on the show, paul hackett did lose, but the progressive blogs online are celebrating a victory. %$* 325
why? %$* 325
well, he got 48 percent of the vote in a heavily republican district. %$* 325
that is a big deal. %$* 325
they're saying this is an omen of things to come in 2006 and elections down the line. %$* 325
over at offthekuff, this is charles kuffner, who is a consultant at a multinational firm. %$* 325
he blogs at offthekuff.com. %$* 325
he says here are his final thoughts, that hackett definitely beat the spread. %$* 325
he says the positive media surrounding this election, it validates the run- everywhere concept the dems will be pushing. %$* 325
he says it shows the power of the netroots fund-raising effort. %$* 325
we talked about that extensively here yesterday. %$* 325
and also, he says making the republicans drop half-a-million dollars on a race that was supposed to be just a formality, not a bad thing. %$* 325
so, a lot of celebration and excitement in the progressive blogs that have really followed this race today. %$* 384
and there's also some looking forward to hackett's future. %$* 384
jerome armstrong at www.mydd.com, these guys had really followed this race. %$* 384
they're hoping that -- they're saying that the battle for ohio has now been engaged, hoping that hackett will run for governor or maybe a senate seat there. %$* 384
lots of fingers crossed for him there. %$* 384
over on the right, there's a little bit of gloating, though, it that has to be said. %$* 384
redstate.org, yesterday, they were pointing out that so much online money had been raised by bloggers, pointing out that that was extraordinary. %$* 384
but, today, they're saying, well, it still didn't get you very far, did it? %$* 384
he didn't win and also all the candidates that the daily kos people backed last year didn't win, saying not so fast, a little bit too early for celebration. %$* 384
interesting, though, also at redstate, someone else is posting about ohio and this -- the ohio gop needs to wake up now, pointing out that there have been scandals there, that this should be a wakeup call, a warning for the republicans in ohio. %$* 384
also, some lessons to be learned over on the progressive blogs. %$* 325
we've got nathannewman.org. %$* 325
he's a lawyer and a writer. %$* 325
and he has got a big post saying, still need a message. %$* 325
he says the democrats need a strong united message that their candidates can run on. %$* 325
he says they also have to be just as solid in pushing that message as they have been in attacking gop policies. %$* 325
another progressive who is weighing in, in terms of lessons learned is steve gilliard. %$* 325
this is stevegilliard.blogspot.com. %$* 325
he points out that the grassroots effort on the ground and the online netroots effort work side by side, but there was no integration, and that is something that needs to change, also noting that, as the blogs grow, the technology and the tools they have are something that they're learning to work and manipulate day by day. %$* 325
so, the blogs continuing to grow, that being the huge story, is the impact that they had in this election. %$* 325
so, growing in influence in politics. %$* 384
but also, there's a report out this week suggesting that they're growing at an extraordinary pace in terms of sheer number. %$* 384
david sifry is the ceo and the founder of technorati.com, an online site that tracks web logs as they appear, looks for stories in them. %$* 384
he's got a state of the blogosphere report that's come out this week. %$* 384
he did one earlier this year. %$* 384
when he did his last report, there were eight million blogs out there. %$* 384
now he says there are over 40 million. %$* 384
the size of the blogosphere has doubled in five months. %$* 384
he says that a blog is being created every second. %$* 384
now, many bloggers are pointing out, linking to this, saying not so fast. %$* 384
these numbers seem a little bit inflated. %$* 384
some of these are spam blogs, not hosted by a real person. %$* 384
also, some of them are blogs that are created once and never updated, like this one here. %$* 384
sifry updates again today with his second installment of the state of the blogosphere, this one about posts. %$* 325
he says there are 900,000 posts a day. %$* 325
that translates to 10.4 posts a second. %$* 325
he also has this wonderful chart that shows how posts and search volume spikes with major worldwide news events. %$* 325
he says these numbers continue to grow. %$* 325
and, throughout the week, he continues to release more and more information, as his state of the blogosphere report continues. %$* 325
thanks, guys. %$* 504
the "strategy session" is straight ahead on inside politics. %$* 504
today, the fight for iraq. %$* 504
more american troops have died at the hands of insurgents. %$* 504
and here at home, an iraq war veteran sharply critical of president bush comes surprisingly close to pulling off a huge upset in his bid for a seat in congress -- that issue and other hot political topics when we return. %$* 504
welcome back to inside politics and our "strategy session" on today's hottest political topics. %$* 360
with us today, democratic strategist and cnn political analyst paul begala and former pentagon spokeswoman victoria clarke. %$* 360
today's topics, as more americans lose their lives in iraq, an anti-war candidate in ohio comes closer than expected to pulling off a huge upset. %$* 360
president bush gets out of washington for a long working vacation. %$* 360
and a senate questionnaire sheds more light on supreme court nominee john roberts. %$* 360
up first, iraq, a country that's still a very deadly place for american troops. %$* 360
fourteen u.s. marines were killed today in a roadside bombing. %$* 360
the iraq issue remains a troublesome one for president bush. %$* 360
in that ohio race, democrat paul hackett, an iraq war veteran, lost yesterday's special election in a heavily republican district by just a few thousand votes. %$* 360
and despite the loss, democrats are not hanging their heads. %$* 360
something like 40 americans or more killed in 10 days? %$* 467
you're just -- you're struck by the tragedy of it. %$* 505
i heard it first thing this morning and i just thought of those poor young people who are doing such a good job, of their families and the toll it will take on them. %$* 505
it is gut wrenching, but not completely unexpected. %$* 505
the people there on the ground have said for sometime, we're going to have some good days. %$* 505
we're going to have bad days. %$* 505
we've had some just terrible days recently and you just have to constantly go back and say it makes it even more important to be determined, to see this through to where the iraqis can take on more of the security burden. %$* 505
paul, the question i asked earlier in the show, is there something this administration isn't doing that it should, at least when you talk about public relations right now? %$* 360
yes. %$* 506
i think so. %$* 506
if you look at senator mccain, a republican in the senate who's probably the chief supporter of the war in either party, he's seen as the most credible guy in american politics. %$* 506
people respect him and admire him; some agree, some disagree. %$* 506
the president, however, has a credibility problem that mccain doesn't have. %$* 506
they have the same substantive position, but completely different views of credibility. %$* 506
why? %$* 506
well, in part, now a majority of americans in a gallup poll, 51 percent, say the president misled us going into the war. %$* 506
and since then, i think the president has calibrated too far over to the happy-talk side of things and not as far to sort of the mccain side of -- as torie just said -- this is very tough, it's bloody, it's awful, but we're in it and we've got to win it. %$* 506
that's a message that even opponents who are like me, i think, could rally to. %$* 506
but i think the president has -- at least has given the public a sense that he's not leveling with us. %$* 506
and when a politician loses his credibility, he loses everything. %$* 506
now, the president is certainly trying to stay on message, at least right now. %$* 360
we have a little sound clip of his message on iraq. %$* 360
the violence in recent days in iraq is a grim reminder of the enemies we face. %$* 161
these terrorists and insurgents will use brutal tactics because they're trying to shake the will of the united states of america. %$* 161
that's what they're trying to do. %$* 161
they want us to retreat. %$* 161
they want us, in our compassion for the innocent, say we're through. %$* 161
that's what they want. %$* 161
they will fail. %$* 161
here at home -- you wanted to say something? %$* 360
no. %$* 505
i just disagree slightly with paul and his characterization of the president -- being, to say something is a grim reminder of the brutality of these people, that's hardly happy talk. %$* 505
and when there is a bad patch, the president has been out there more than previous commanders-in-chief in tough times like this. %$* 505
so, i give him credit for trying to be as straight as possible. %$* 505
of course, he has to be positive and optimistic about the ultimate outcome. %$* 505
he absolutely has to be. %$* 505
it's a tough, tough job and it is easy to sit somewhere else and criticize and talk about all the bad things that are happening. %$* 505
it's harder to be the one that leads the strategy and the plan all the way through. %$* 505
yes. %$* 506
but how do you explain that mccain is so trusted and the president so distrusted when they have the same position? %$* 506
i just think it is far easier to be on the outside talking and criticizing about what's going on, than being the ones on the inside, making the tough decisions day in and day out. %$* 505
let's talk a little bit about this ohio race that's been one of the themes of our show. %$* 360
you had jean schmidt and hackett running head-to-head there in a very close race. %$* 360
the republican ends up winning, but it was a much closer race than expected. %$* 360
and a lot of people say it was all about iraq. %$* 360
is this, to either of you, a sign of things to come with the midterms down the road? %$* 360
well, it was about iraq and corruption. %$* 506
the governor of ohio, bob taft, is desperately unpopular. %$* 506
he's got a real corruption scandal. %$* 506
democrats see both of those issues perhaps playing to their favor in '06, when you have corruption problems in washington with the republican party -- tom delay, karl rove, duke cunningham, the california congressman who has ethical problems. %$* 506
so democrats see this as a sign that the country is turning away. %$* 506
when the president ran in that same district just a few months ago, he got 64 percent. %$* 506
when you drop from 64 percent to 52, that's a collapse. %$* 506
and the democrats believe that a guy like major hackett, who's a marine major, is in a good position to offer a critique of the war, because he fought the war. %$* 506
so he's not being disloyal. %$* 506
he is saying essentially, no, we should not cut and run, but no, we weren't told the truth going in either. %$* 506
and that seemed to be a pretty powerful message in a very republican district. %$* 506
i think it's too soon to say if that's going to -- and it certainly won't be the way it will be across the country next year. %$* 505
every district will be different. %$* 505
in some places, iraq is going to have a more prominent role than others. %$* 505
it depends on what's going on with the economy. %$* 505
it depends on other issues. %$* 505
i think it's too soon to say, boy, this is it for the democrats next year. %$* 505
there was a lot of really tough language in this race and hackett, as a matter of fact, was responsible for some of it. %$* 360
do you think that turns voters off in ohio ... %$* 360
no. %$* 506
.. and the midwest? %$* 360
no. %$* 506
he went -- look, no democrat has gotten better than 37 percent in that district. %$* 506
major hackett goes out there and calls president bush an s.o.b., calls him a chicken-hawk. %$* 506
in a debate he's asked, what's the greatest threat to american national security? %$* 506
he says, that guy sitting in the white house. %$* 506
now, beware my fellow democrats. %$* 506
you can probably only get away with talking like a marine, if you are a marine, ok? %$* 506
if you're a guy like me who never finished the boy scouts and you talk that way, people are going to hate you. %$* 506
no. %$* 505
i agree completely. %$* 505
all right. %$* 360
we'll take a break and come right back. %$* 360
president bush takes a long working vacation, but the white house says it's not just r and r. straight ahead, we'll focus on mr. bush's five weeks away from washington. %$* 360
stay with us. %$* 360
the "strategy session" continues right after this. %$* 360
the "strategy session" continues on inside politics. %$* 360
with me today, democratic strategist paul begala and former pentagon spokeswoman victoria clarke. %$* 360
president bush is spending time away from the white house; 33 days, to be exact. %$* 360
during his stay at his ranch in crawford, texas, mr. bush will surpass ronald reagan's record for time away from washington. %$* 360
and while democrats needle the president about his time off, the white house insists mr. bush is taking care of the affairs of state. %$* 360
on today's agenda, a trip to grapevine, texas, for a speech touting some of mr. bush's accomplishments including economic growth. %$* 360
you know, we went through a recession and a stock market correction and a terrorist attack and corporate scandals and war. %$* 161
and in spite of that, this economy is growing at some of the highest levels ever. %$* 161
so, it good strategy for the president to be away on this vacation right now? %$* 360
the word vacation shouldn't be used. %$* 505
look, i go on vacation. %$* 505
i swim with my kids on vacation. %$* 505
i take them out in boats. %$* 505
we go fishing. %$* 505
he goes on vacation, he's meeting with heads of state. %$* 505
he's having vtcs with his military leaders. %$* 505
he's going out and giving speeches once or twice a week. %$* 505
he's talking about the remarkable accomplishments of his administration thus far. %$* 505
that's a pretty tough vacation. %$* 505
i love it. %$* 506
it's like -- they come to him at some point and say, mr. president, you're an all-time low in the polls. %$* 506
the majority of americans now don't trust you. %$* 506
your chief foreign enterprise, iraq, is not going well. %$* 506
your chief domestic enterprise, social security privatization, is dead. %$* 506
your chief aide is spending half his life in front of the grand jury. %$* 506
and he says road trip. %$* 506
and i'm going to endorse that. %$* 506
no. %$* 506
tory's right. %$* 506
no president is ever truly on vacation. %$* 506
and i think democrats are wrong to attack him for this. %$* 506
i whole-heartedly endorse the president going on vacation. %$* 506
and i think democrats, instead of attacking him for going, should say, look at that speech. %$* 506
he says the economy is great. %$* 506
he can be just as out of touch in texas as he is in the oval office. %$* 506
if being out of touch is having low -- 5 percent unemployment, lowest it's been since 9/11, lowest average of the last three decades, having the strong growth in the economy that we have, that's a pretty good agenda. %$* 505
and i promise you, those american people with whom the democrats are trying to score some cheap shots, are going to see a heck of a lot more of the president of the united states over the next 30 days than they will of their elected representatives, including democrats. %$* 505
but that's part of the peril. %$* 506
when president clinton used to go on vacation, he would actually just go and hide in martha's vineyard. %$* 506
we'd make him. %$* 506
he hated doing it. %$* 506
he would go up. %$* 506
he hated doing it? %$* 505
he's not that good an actor. %$* 505
i don't think he hated doing it. %$* 505
president bush, i actually think would do well to dial back his public presence. %$* 506
right now, the american people are annoyed with him. %$* 506
mostly they've liked him. %$* 506
but right now they are annoyed with him. %$* 506
and if i were advising him, quite honestly, i'd say go and hide in crawford for a few days or a few weeks. %$* 506
don't run out to grapevine, texas, and give speeches. %$* 506
he's got a great story to tell on the domestic front. %$* 505
he's got a tough story to tell, but he's got to do it, on the national security front. %$* 505
he is the best messenger of that. %$* 505
and he's got to be out there, because if he just leaves a vacuum to those who want to say oh my god, where's the president, if he did go away for 10 days and have the kind of vacation that paul and i get to have, then paul would be sitting here saying, oh my god, all these problems and all he's doing is going home. %$* 505
no. %$* 506
i'll defend myself. %$* 506
for five years, every summer, i have endorsed and embraced the president's vacations. %$* 506
he deserves a break. %$* 506
the country deserves a break from him, too. %$* 506
but i think it's good. %$* 506
and i'll continue to say it's good. %$* 506
so, one thing, you mentioned karl rove, though. %$* 360
he does put some distance between himself and that, for instance, right? %$* 360
he goes out to texas. %$* 360
he's got the reporters all gathered round to see his one movement or if he goes out to, you know, chop some wood or whatever he does out there at the ranch. %$* 360
i think what's putting the distance between the news coverage and karl rove is there's nothing significant happening. %$* 505
and there hasn't been for some time until the end of this investigation and we hear from fitzgerald. %$* 505
i think that's why you're not seeing that. %$* 505
but he's going to be focused on things that are important to people in this country, including the economy, including jobs, those sorts of things. %$* 505
those are important things to be focused on. %$* 505
and chain sawing cedar trees in bosci county, that's fine. %$* 506
wherever it is. %$* 506
and coming back, too, it's is going to be a very busy season here with the roberts nomination and a whole variety of other things, it's going to put this town on its end. %$* 360
right. %$* 505
and i think one of the reasons, you start looking at these major pieces of legislation that have passed -- the trade legislation, et cetera -- one of the things, members of congress are starting to hear back home, ok, it's fine to criticize. %$* 505
it's fine to belittle the president. %$* 505
but what have you done for me lately? %$* 505
and they're starting to feel some pressure too, as they should, for results. %$* 505
the sense and the direction of the country in all of the pollings that we're going desperately off in the wrong direction. %$* 467
only 37 percent think we're on the right track. %$* 467
at this stage of his presidency, ronald reagan was at 67 percent. %$* 467
president bush is at 45. %$* 467
bill clinton was at 68. %$* 467
george bush is at 45. %$* 467
he's in bad shape for a second term president. %$* 467
is he doing the right thing, strategy-wise, by sticking to his guns on the veto threat on stem cell? %$* 360
i mean, now you have bill frist getting behind embryonic stem cell research, and at least the senate is sending strong indications that the white house isn't going to have... %$* 360
i don't think he has any choice. %$* 505
he has staked his position on a very controversial issue, even with his own party. %$* 505
it is so emotional, it's so hot, i don't think he has any room to do anything but that. %$* 505
i think torie's right. %$* 506
you can't budge. %$* 506
as it is, he gets some static from both sides for his position, which seems to be stem cell research is wrong, it's the taking of a life, but i'm the first president to fund the taking of a life, which is kind of morally incoherent. %$* 506
if he added any more nuance to it, or changed position at all, he'd be through. %$* 506
he's got to stick with his pledge, veto the bill and just be unpopular for it. %$* 506
all right. %$* 360
we'll be right back. %$* 360
we're learning more about supreme court nominee john roberts. %$* 360
still to come, roberts spells out his view of the job in a reply to senate questions. %$* 360
that's our focus when the "strategy session" continues. %$* 360
i'm wolf blitzer in washington. %$* 142
coming up at the top of the hour, a bloody day for u.s. troops in iraq. %$* 142
fourteen united states marines killed by a roadside bomb. %$* 142
six killed earlier in the week. %$* 142
we'll have president bush's reaction. %$* 142
everyone got out of this burning airliner safely, but what caused the fire in the first place? %$* 142
we'll have the latest on the investigation. %$* 142
and 19 years in prison for a crime he did not commit. %$* 142
now he's free. %$* 142
and we'll talk with thomas doswell. %$* 142
all those stories, much more, only minutes away on wolf blitzer reports. %$* 142
now back to inside politics. %$* 142
"strategy session" continues on inside politics. %$* 360
still here, democratic strategist paul begala and former pentagon spokeswoman victoria clarke. %$* 360
can't get rid of us. %$* 506
sorry. %$* 360
what i think we want to talk about now is john roberts and his views of the job. %$* 360
in a reply to senate questions, roberts says among other things he would respect legal precedence. %$* 360
those comments released today by the senate judiciary committee. %$* 360
and in texas, president bush had these words for senators as they prepare for roberts' confirmation hearings. %$* 360
they must be deliberate. %$* 161
but they also must hear this cause. %$* 161
roberts needs to get his hearing done, and the confirmation completed so he can be seated before the supreme court reconvenes in early october. %$* 161
so what does it tell you when roberts, in this writing that goes to the united states senate, talks about the importance of precedent? %$* 360
are we hearing code here about roe versus wade? %$* 360
you know, people on the far left and far right, some of the special interest groups, will be very into the code talking. %$* 505
i think the surprise here, every day we learn more about him, is not many surprises. %$* 505
he's very smart, very articulate, has a strict interpretation of what the constitution intended, a great deal of respect for the roles and responsibilities for the three branches of government. %$* 505
if you want to honestly say, ok, i'm learning about his philosophy, i'm learning how he looks at government and those sorts of things, then you're taking in a lot. %$* 505
if you want to find those secret messages about specific cases, you're making it up if you think you found it. %$* 505
i've been -- one trick pony on this. %$* 506
why not tell us? %$* 506
why do we need a secret decoder ring? %$* 506
why can't we ask him a legitimate question? %$* 506
what would everybody in town talk about? %$* 505
i know. %$* 506
but he should ask -- i think senators should ask him not about this case percolating up through the courts that he might have to rule on, but ask him, some people read the constitution to allow affirmative action, some think the constitution bars it. %$* 506
some people believe the constitution requires a right to abortion, others think it doesn't. %$* 506
those are important issues. %$* 506
but thousands and thousands and thousands -- i think it's literally in the hundreds of thousands -- of pages now of documentation have been turned over so people prior to the confirmation hearings can learn as much as possible. %$* 249
voluminous -- amazing what you can learn from those. %$* 249
and then i think what is going on now is those democratic senators who want to make this as controversial as possible, are trying to find ways to frame the questions that will make it very difficult for him to answer. %$* 249
and again, i go back to my one-trick pony, and this is the ginsberg strategy. %$* 249
he has to do what ruth bader ginsberg said, some questions are appropriate to answer and some aren't. %$* 249
but the problem with that is justice ginsberg when she was judge ginsberg was asked straight up, do you believe there's a constitutional right for abortion by hank brown, who was then a senator from colorado. %$* 506
she said, yes. %$* 506
in fact, she went on to say without the right to have an abortion, a woman is not a fully adult human being. %$* 506
now that's a pretty strong statement. %$* 506
she said that in her confirmation hearings. %$* 506
and you know what? %$* 506
the world didn't end. %$* 506
she told us that you have to have an abortion right. %$* 506
and i believe this judge doesn't think there's a right. %$* 506
and he should just say so. %$* 506
and there are plenty of incidents -- questions where she said, not appropriate. %$* 505
and that was wrong for her. %$* 506
that would be expressing an opinion that might come before me. %$* 505
another thing that came out of these filings is how much money he's worth, john roberts, something like $5.3 million. %$* 360
he made a lot of money out there as a lawyer here in town, in fact. %$* 360
and i would be willing to bet every case and issue he worked on that in that law firm we'll probably hear about between now and then. %$* 505
i'm sure you will. %$* 360
but do you think the issue of his tax returns might come up? %$* 360
and is that going to have a bearing at all? %$* 360
is this something that is fair game for a supreme court justice? %$* 360
you can get into discussions about what's fair game and what's not. %$* 505
but the reality is, people will ask and challenge almost everything. %$* 505
that's just the reality of the way this town operates. %$* 505
now, i don't think it's right. %$* 505
i think it's one of the reasons it's getting harder and harder to get good people to go into public service. %$* 505
but it's reality. %$* 505
and i'm sure he's prepared for it. %$* 505
and i don't think it's getting harder to get good people to go into public service. %$* 506
and he should have to disclose his tax returns: not his personal life, not his personal life, not his video rentals as some people tried to get into with republican nominees for the court in the past. %$* 506
but his financial disclosure should be absolute and complete and should include tax returns just like every congressman and senator practically does. %$* 506
but, you know, now that you've said that, i would be willing to bet in a few weeks, there's going to be a style section, that classic late august style section story about the video rentals. %$* 505
all right. %$* 360
thank you both. %$* 360
victoria clarke, paul begala, appreciate you coming in. %$* 360
it's been a good talk. %$* 360
you, too. %$* 505
we're leaving now. %$* 505
all right. %$* 360
don't go! %$* 360
don't go. %$* 360
a freelance journalist and blogger is one of the latest victims in the war on iraq. %$* 360
our blog reporters return with what bloggers are saying about the work of stephen vincent. %$* 360
there's word just coming into cnn about the man charged in the recent homicide and abduction of the groene children in idaho. %$* 360
the sheriff in riverside county, california, announced earlier this hour that joseph duncan is the prime suspect in the 1997 abduction and murder of a 10-year-old california boy. %$* 360
duncan, you may recall, was recently charged in the idaho case involving shasta and dylan groene. %$* 360
he is accused of killing three people at the groene home and then abducting 9-year-old dylan and his 8-year-old sister shasta. %$* 360
dylan's body was later found in montana. %$* 360
shasta groene was rescued after a waitress spotted her with duncan inside a restaurant and called police. %$* 360
the iraq war claims another victim, freelance journalist and blogger steven vincent. %$* 360
let's check in now with cnn political producer abbi tatton and jacki schechner, our blog reporter -- jacki. %$* 360
well, joe, bloggers are certainly mourning the death of one of their own today. %$* 325
steven vincent, the journalist murdered in iraq, was well known and well read in the online journalism community. %$* 325
he was a frequent contributor to the "national review online." %$* 325
and over there today at their blog "the corner," k.j. %$* 325
lopez has a link to her tribute. %$* 325
she calls steven vincent "freedom's reporter." %$* 325
now, steven vincent himself also had a blog. %$* 325
that blog is "in the red zone" at expensepublishing.typepad.com. %$* 384
if you look at it today, there is a simple tribute there. %$* 384
but you can scroll back for months and months of reports from in and around basra where he was reporting from. %$* 384
one of his reports was published in the "new york times" op ed section over the weekend when he was looking at the tight grip that shiite groups have developed over the city of basra. %$* 384
he was sharply critical of some of those groups. %$* 384
also, in a recent post, "the naive american" he echoed some of those thoughts. %$* 384
it was this kind of reporting that had bloggers all around the world linking to him. %$* 384
arthur chrenkoff, his online friend, posted a tribute today. %$* 384
lots of links there saying of his reportings, this is some of the best journalism to come out of iraq since the liberation. %$* 384
not uncritical, yet sympathetic. %$* 384
bloggers clearly saddened by the loss. %$* 325
also praising his work. %$* 325
one of the military bloggers, murdockonline.net talking about the book "in the red zone" that steven vincent wrote, saying that he's read many books, columns, blog posts and reports on the situation in iraq, none come as close to, quote, "hitting the nail on the head as vincent's books." %$* 325
so, all of us saddened by that loss. %$* 325
and bloggers, especially paying tribute today. %$* 325
joe, we'll send it back to you. %$* 325
thanks, guys. %$* 360
that's it for inside politics. %$* 360
i'm joe johns. %$* 360
wolf blitzer reports starts right now. %$* 360

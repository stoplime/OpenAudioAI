absolutely. %$* 168
got the big exclusives at the top of the hour: sanders, rubio, and trump. %$* 168
but right now inside politics. %$* 168
hillary clinton keeps cool before the benghazi committee. %$* 169
i'm sorry that it doesn't fit your narrative, congressman. %$* 149
i can only tell you what the facts were. %$* 149
and avoid a costly fight with a potential rival. %$* 169
unfortunately i believe we're out of time. %$* 89
plus a florida fight brewing -- trump stomps on bush and rubio's home turf. %$* 169
bush -- now here is a guy wants to run our country and he can't even run his own campaign. %$* 5
but new polls show a new leader in iowa. %$* 169
inside politics the biggest stories sourced by the best reporters now. %$* 169
welcome to inside politics. %$* 169
i'm the other john -- john berman. %$* 169
john king is off this week. %$* 169
with us to share the reporting and their insights julie pace of the associated press; cnn's manu raju; margaret talev of bloomberg news; and cnn's nia-malika henderson. %$* 169
so in hillary clinton's own words it has been quite a week. %$* 169
but even if she has her groove back following the democratic debate, the benghazi committee and joe biden's decision to stay out of the democratic race she is still well, hillary clinton -- cautious, measured. %$* 169
at last night's big jefferson jackson dinner in iowa she took only the subtlest of swipes at the populism of senator bernie sanders. %$* 169
it's not enough just to rail against the republicans or the billionaires. %$* 149
we actually have to win this election. %$* 149
all right. %$* 169
clinton's big week even included a former president stumping for her on the campaign trail which is sort of a first this election cycle. %$* 169
there's been a lot of talk about breaking the glass ceiling. %$* 149
and i want to talk about one barrier that has not been broken. %$* 149
i want you to support hillary for me, too because i want to break a ceiling. %$* 149
i'm tired of the strangle hold that women have had on the job of presidential spouse. %$* 149
all right. %$* 169
do it for bill clinton. %$* 169
let's talk about this big week for the clinton campaign. %$* 169
you know, julie, i worked in manhattan which is right next to brooklyn which is where the clinton campaign has its headquarters. %$* 169
and there was something between a sigh of relief and like shriek of joy coming from brooklyn. %$* 169
absolutely. %$* 170
absolutely. %$* 170
this was the best week that clinton has had since she announced her candidacy by far. %$* 170
and she needed this week if you look at the trajectory of her campaign throughout the spring and the summer -- it was basically on a downward trajectory. %$* 170
now she's cleared joe biden out of the race. %$* 170
she got through the benghazi hearing which i think really for people who maybe were on the fence about hillary clinton showed them the strength that they wanted to see in her. %$* 170
the challenge for clinton, though, will be she's never at her best when she's ahead. %$* 170
she's great when she's a fighter, when she's coming from behind. %$* 170
now she's reasserted herself as the frontrunner, how she handles this position i think will say a lot about her candidacy. %$* 170
you know, manu, you were up on the capitol hill for the hearing on thursday. %$* 169
matt lewis who's a conservative writer for the "daily caller" said it was like a sports game, that moment in the game when the momentum shifts you could feel it. %$* 169
what was it like? %$* 169
yes, it really felt that way because republicans were trying to create an impression to get her to own the libya policy and also suggest that she didn't do enough to get back enough to respond to those concerns that ambassador chris stevens raised. %$* 146
and instead was listening to people who didn't know enough like libya like her friend and adviser sidney blumenthal. %$* 146
but unfortunately for them they ended up chasing a lot of rabbit holes -- going down a lot of rabbit holes. %$* 146
and when they were going after hillary in a lot of areas they ended up stepping in it themselves in a lot of ways by making it look -- you know, trying to create this gotcha moments rather than playing into that larger narrative. %$* 146
so in the end i think republicans were very frustrated about how it turned out. %$* 146
it ended up going probably a few hours longer than they probably wanted to. %$* 146
but i think the hope for the republicans is that even though she may have survived this that there are episodes from that hearing that they could turn out to hurt her in a couple of more months particularly when she said that 90 percent to 95 percent of the e-mails were on state department servers. %$* 146
we don't really know where she came up with that figure. %$* 146
she claimed it came from the state department but maybe in a couple of months, we'll figure out that maybe she wasn't quite telling the truth there. %$* 146
so maybe this could hurt her in the long run. %$* 146
at least some republicans though. %$* 146
so margaret build on that. %$* 169
you know, besides just this and what was said maybe it be used against her from these hearings, what else are the risks for hillary clinton going forward after what many are calling her best week? %$* 169
well, there's her defensive game and there's here offensive game. %$* 171
and she has shown she's good at the defensive game. %$* 171
but in terms of breaking new ground and going forward that's really the challenge. %$* 171
right now her lead in the primary looks large enough that it's entirely possible she can just keep playing a defensive game until february and be ok. %$* 171
but even if she becomes the nominee she still faces this challenge of, you know, how does she present herself? %$* 171
how does she shape it on her terms? %$* 171
the likability factor, all this sort of stuff. %$* 171
my 11-year-old who is my sometimes barometer for the stuff said to me as we're watching the jj dinner. %$* 171
she says "wait, so now she likes katy perry and chipotle?" %$* 171
there's still a convincibility factor kind of the natural on-the-fly do people like you stuff that is important in campaigns. %$* 171
so nia, i want to talk about then, what the rest of the %$* 172
candidates in the democratic race do about this. %$* 172
let me play you some sound from the jj dinner last night -- bernie sanders. %$* 172
he really seemed to go directly after hillary clinton although without naming her in a way that was at least at a minimum more firm than he ever has before. %$* 172
let's listen. %$* 172
i pledge to you that every day i will fight for the public interest not the corporate interests. %$* 128
i will not abandon any segment of american society whether you're gay or black or latino, poor, or working class just because it is politically expedient at a given time. %$* 128
politically expedient at a given time. %$* 169
right. %$* 173
right. %$* 173
those were directly meant for hillary clinton. %$* 169
right. %$* 173
like hillary clinton he may as well have said. %$* 173
obviously he didn't to. %$* 173
i think this is a preview of what we're going to see from bernie sanders in the debate that is coming up in a couple of weeks in mid- november. %$* 173
he was in some ways mr. nice guy in the first debate. %$* 173
gave her a solid by saying we don't care about your e-mails. %$* 173
i do think he has to get tougher on her; whether or not it works for him we'll have to see. %$* 173
he has a lot of work to do. %$* 173
i talked to his campaign advisers. %$* 173
he has a socialism speech where he's going to explain socialism. %$* 173
something every candidate has to do. %$* 169
that's right. %$* 173
that's right. %$* 173
but he's going put it in the context of american traditions like the fire department. %$* 173
if you like the fire department then you'll like democratic socialism, too, he'll essentially argue. %$* 173
and he may do more speeches in terms of policy whether or not that moves the needle particularly with these different audiences. %$* 173
i mean if you look at most of his audiences they don't really look like the democratic party. %$* 173
they look more like the republican party. %$* 173
that still remains his challenge and this idea of whether he's just plateaued because he hasn't been able to break -- %$* 173
julie, how much risk is there for bernie sanders in going after hillary clinton directly? %$* 169
how much can he do that before he does alienate democratic voters? %$* 169
yes. %$* 170
it's a fine line because sanders for the last couple of months has been talking about how he's never run a negative television ad in his political career. %$* 170
he's not going to go negative. %$* 170
in this campaign he needs to find the sweet spot where he's challenging her but sticking to policy. %$* 170
i think nia mentioned this a little bit. %$* 170
he's starting to turn a little bit toward the personal in the sense that he's saying she's only taking positions because they're politically expedient which basically gets to this trust factor, this authenticity factor. %$* 170
so how can he try to stay a candidate who is not going to go negative while reminding people that there are personal elements of her that they may not like? %$* 170
i want to talk about a democrat who went negative this week who just turned out to be a non candidate. %$* 169
and that is joe biden. %$* 169
joe biden announced he's not getting in the presidential race but only after he seemed to take a swipe at hillary clinton. %$* 169
let's listen to that. %$* 169
i don't believe, like some do, that it is naive to talk to republicans. %$* 89
i don't think we should look at republicans as our enemies. %$* 89
they are opposition. %$* 89
they're not our enemies. %$* 89
that was the third time that joe biden said that in the last ten days. %$* 169
of course, in reference to what hillary clinton said at the cnn debate. %$* 169
margaret -- was it odd that he, you know, decided not to get into the race but at the same time got some body blows in on hillary? %$* 169
to some extent right up until that the last day or so he was actually still preserving his options to get into the race. %$* 171
it really was like within the last day or two of his announcement that he made the final decision. %$* 171
i think part of the calculated risk was thinking hey, maybe i'm going to run. %$* 171
i need to like sort of set the parameters. %$* 171
but part of it also was i don't think he appreciated the way she and john podesta and many of the folks in her campaign began to kind of move to box him out. %$* 171
at first it was like everybody is welcome. %$* 171
we welcome joe. %$* 171
and by the end it wasn't that any more and i think he bristled at that. %$* 171
finally, i think he wants to be remembered and treated with respect. %$* 171
and he felt a little disrespected. %$* 171
see a lot of it -- it personally affected biden that so many of his close friends on capitol hill and in the white house consolidated behind hillary. %$* 146
she was a standard bearer even though he was the vice president. %$* 146
and this was something that had happened -- %$* 146
-- a long, long time ago and it still stings. %$* 169
all right. %$* 169
that's the democrats. %$* 169
let's talk about the republicans. %$* 169
up next donald trump stares up at a new leader in iowa polling as jeb bush stares down into the political abyss. %$* 169
but first politicians say or in this case they sing the darnedest things. %$* 169
here is presidential candidate martin o'malley covering taylor swift for the ladies of "the view" on abc. %$* 169
welcome back to inside politics. %$* 169
don't call it panic. %$* 169
the jeb bush campaign swears there is no panic. %$* 169
what there is, is, you know, efficiencies, downsizing/salaries, travel cutbacks. %$* 169
but of course, from the outside it looks an awful like panic. %$* 169
there are even once unthinkable questions about how much time is left before he's forced to drop out. %$* 169
of course, all of this music to the ears of the man responsible for applying much of this force. %$* 169
you have bush with a failing campaign. %$* 5
he's got no money. %$* 5
he's got no votes. %$* 5
he's way down in the polls. %$* 5
welcome to your first glass house stone-throwing mr. trump because look at the latest poll from iowa showing dr. ben carson running nine points ahead there. %$* 169
trump's response -- go after carson's religion. %$* 169
i'm presbyterian. %$* 5
boy, that's down the middle of the road folks in all fairness. %$* 5
i mean seventh-day adventist i don't know about. %$* 5
i just don't know about. %$* 5
so, nia, you know, when candidates went after mitt romney's faith, you know, his mormon faith in the last couple of elections they did it behind closed doors. %$* 169
there were whispers. %$* 169
wow. %$* 169
i mean donald trump -- this isn't a whisper there. %$* 169
yes. %$* 173
that's rough stuff. %$* 173
yes, it's rough stuff particularly because this is a real strength, right, for ben carson. %$* 173
he, for years, has built up a real base among evangelicals. %$* 173
it's true though that some evangelicals are a little skeptical of the adventist faith. %$* 173
there's some differences in terms of doctrine there. %$* 173
i don't know if donald trump is aware of that. %$* 173
but he's certainly highlighting that. %$* 173
i do think it's dangerous, though, for donald trump because again this is ben carson's strength. %$* 173
he's also talked about him being low energy. %$* 173
and i think ben carson's comeback was like i've done 12 to 18 hours of surgery, which i think -- %$* 173
do you know which presidential candidate has talked about faith in ways that we've rarely heard before? %$* 169
dr. ben carson -- right. %$* 169
ben carson said he wouldn't support a muslim in the white house. %$* 169
ben carson said had jews been armed in nazi germany, we wouldn't have had the holocaust there. %$* 169
so has he opened the door to this a little bit -- margaret? %$* 169
i mean kind of. %$* 171
also donald trump has proved so far that you can like do the most whatever political, you know, conventional wisdom would tell you not to do like on women, you know, whatever. %$* 171
and here he is, though. %$* 171
i think he's decided to kind of live or die by the sword and on his own terms. %$* 171
he's just doing it his way. %$* 171
and part of it, too, john is that, you know, trump has had this campaign where he just constantly points to how he is first place everywhere. %$* 146
he's been leading in all the polls in iowa and new hampshire, nationally. %$* 146
now what happens when he starts to slip as we saw in these two iowa polls where he's in second place -- what is his talking point then? %$* 146
how does he deal with that? %$* 146
can he even handle that personally when he's second or third place? %$* 146
but he knows that nobody is going to do to him what he is doing to them. %$* 171
yes. %$* 170
nobody is going to -- %$* 171
what does ben carson do about this all of a sudden now that he's winning somewhere? %$* 169
well, that's going to be a fascinating question because ben carson actually hasn't been campaigning very often. %$* 170
we haven't seen him on the campaign trail very much. %$* 170
he's on a book tour. %$* 171
he's on a book tour. %$* 170
and a lot of his support is grassroots built up from people who have followed him throughout his career. %$* 170
now there's going to be a lot of focus on him when he's in the debate next week. %$* 170
he's going to be getting more time, more questions on policy which has not been a strength of his. %$* 170
but again, this is a cycle where some of these standard things that we %$* 170
expect candidates to rise and fall on have just not mattered. %$* 170
so one of the things we expected in this campaign was jeb bush to largely be leading for much of the campaign which he is not doing right now at all. %$* 169
in fact he just cut his staff. %$* 169
he's cutting salaries. %$* 169
this is a big thing. %$* 169
and he was asked about what is going on, on the campaign trail and he's getting pretty combative about it. %$* 169
listen. %$* 169
if this election is about how we're going to fight to get nothing done, then i don't want any part of it. %$* 161
i got a lot of really cool things i can do other than sit around being miserable listening to people demonize me and me feeling compelled to demonize them. %$* 161
that's a joke -- elect trump if you want that. %$* 161
you know manu, megyn kelly on fox news asked jeb bush this week "when will you drop out"? %$* 169
are you essentially? %$* 169
can you imagine? %$* 169
could you have imagined that five months ago? %$* 169
no. %$* 146
because he came in saying that, you know, raising expectations very, very high. %$* 146
that they raised $100 million per quarter they would really blow everybody out of the water and it just has not taken shape. %$* 146
i think a lot of these jeb donors that really was driving the cuts in the staff salaries and the laying off of employees is because they just feel that there's not any return on their investment. %$* 146
i think that, you know, we'll see if anything changed, john, when advertisements start taking shape and the air work starts to really, really -- %$* 146
but more intensely -- i mean -- %$* 169
and that's really -- that's what is driving a lot of these fears. %$* 146
i spent this week talking to jeb supporters in the first four states and one of the really interesting things that i heard repeatedly from jeb's supporters, these are people who like him is they just aren't sure if he has it. %$* 170
yes. %$* 173
they just aren't sure if no matter what changes they make on the campaign, no matter how often that he's on tv. %$* 170
they're not sure that jeb bush the man matches this moment. %$* 170
there's nothing you can really do to change that. %$* 170
yes, i mean it's like they want steak. %$* 173
they want red meat, they want sizzle and jeb bush is kind of like meat loaf. %$* 173
he's perfectly fine but no one gets excited about meat loaf. %$* 173
i've heard people say that he needs a hillary clinton-like performance at this debate to set this back on track. %$* 169
that's a high bar potentially. %$* 169
that's true. %$* 171
when we talk about panic, i think there is obviously a measured panic going on here. %$* 171
the kind of rational part of jeb bush says there's no way that donald trump and ben carson are going to be the nominees of the party. %$* 171
what i need to do is retrench, figure out how to pace my assets a little bit longer and be a little more strategic. %$* 171
new hampshire is a bigger problem than it should be for him. %$* 171
he's starting to realize that. %$* 171
he's got to do it now. %$* 169
of course, stay with cnn for much more from the presidential contenders. %$* 169
at the top of the hour donald trump, marco rubio, bernie sanders -- a trifecta among jake tapper's guests on cnn "state of the union". %$* 169
next our reporters open up their notebooks to get ahead of the big political news that's just around the corning including inside information about what is ahead for the next speaker of the house. %$* 169
all right. %$* 169
let's head around the inside politics table and ask our reporters to share a nugget from their notebooks. %$* 169
julie. %$* 169
in talking to republican voters in new hampshire and iowa over the past week, it feels like they've reached a turning point in this race. %$* 170
when you talked to voters earlier this year they would say we're so happy to have this big republican field. %$* 170
now voters are saying when is the field going to start to winnow down. %$* 170
this is a data point when cnn had a republican debate at this point in the 2012 election. %$* 170
there were seven candidates on this stage. %$* 170
this week's republican debate has ten on the main stage, four in an undercard debate. %$* 170
but, you know, when you ask these voters who should drop out, no one, of course, will say that their favorite candidate should be pulling out of the race. %$* 170
all right. %$* 169
manu. %$* 169
john, paul ryan is going to be elected speaker on thursday. %$* 146
that's going to be the easy part. %$* 146
the hard part is going to happen immediately afterwards. %$* 146
and even before this week congress is going to start to try to address the debt ceiling, raise the debt limit. %$* 146
it's been of course, have been an issue that has divided republicans very badly during the john boehner era. %$* 146
now paul ryan is going to have to cast a vote to increase the debt ceiling. %$* 146
this is going to anger folks on the right. %$* 146
they're probably going to have a short term debt limit increase. %$* 146
i mean they're going to try to do that. %$* 146
and if they do, it's going to on paul ryan's lap as soon as he gets in. %$* 146
plus there's a december 11th funding deadline. %$* 146
he's going to have to cut a deal with the white house and engage in these bipartisan talks and of course, anger the right wing of his party. %$* 146
so he is really stepping in the same problems that john boehner had over the last seven years. %$* 146
sort of like a congratulations is with a question mark. %$* 169
congratulations? %$* 169
no joe. %$* 174
so we know joe biden is out. %$* 174
it doesn't matter. %$* 174
what impact is it going to have -- right? %$* 174
we already saw david plouffe jump in and endorse hillary clinton right away, former delaware bond together. %$* 174
but joe is out. %$* 174
so what? %$* 174
so what about the union money? %$* 174
what about the union support? %$* 174
how quickly does that consolidate now probably around hillary clinton maybe some around bernie sanders. %$* 174
also does joe biden news coverage from all of us completely evaporate which is, you know, what he's been guarding against. %$* 174
wanted to get as much of his legacy building and it's possible, just in case that happened. %$* 174
and then the kind of the final two joe factors which are is he going to be a thorn in hillary clinton's side or not? %$* 174
and when are we going to see his sort of the rest of his legacy emerge? %$* 174
the cancer activism that he told us that he was going to be doing? %$* 174
when do we start to see joe biden's last act as vice president. %$* 174
he really focused on that in the speech. %$* 169
all right. %$* 169
nia. %$* 169
two big events for hillary clinton on friday. %$* 173
one in atlanta where she will launch "african-americans for hillary clinton"; the other in charleston, south carolina, which, of course, was the site of the terrible shooting of those african-americans in the church and also the walter scott shooting. %$* 173
she'll address the naacp there. %$* 173
on substance, it will be interesting what she said she's going to lay what her agenda means for african-americans. %$* 173
she'll likely talk about criminal justice reform as well. %$* 173
but it will be interesting just the spectacle as well. %$* 173
what does she draw in terms of crowd size? %$* 173
how enthusiastic are those crowds? %$* 173
and everyone knows that the comparisons with obama will be made as well as bernie sanders who has been able to draw really big crowds. %$* 173
she's certainly trying to put a marker down in those states and for he connections to african-american voters. %$* 173
the bar is pretty high there. %$* 169
all right. %$* 169
my turn. %$* 169
now that vice president biden has announced he's now running for president, the biggest mystery left in this campaign involves donald trump, namely why won't he advertise? %$* 169
he spent zero dollars running zero commercials in zero key states. %$* 169
i've heard from republican and democratic consultants this week who call this malpractice. %$* 169
now trump's explanation is he doesn't need it. %$* 169
he's on tv every day. %$* 169
in fact, we have an interview with trump coming up in a little bit. %$* 169
but this misses the point, political bolster you message, they even cast you in a new light. %$* 169
they help. %$* 169
and even strategists who don't like trump tell me that the ad could be huge, huge, huge for him to put them in a language that he might understand. %$* 169
these consultants tell me that with the trump's numbers slipping in iowa it's time that the billionaire put his money where his mouth is literally. %$* 169
that is all for inside politics. %$* 169
again -- thanks for sharing your sunday morning with us. %$* 169
see you soon. %$* 169
"state of the union" starts right now. %$* 169

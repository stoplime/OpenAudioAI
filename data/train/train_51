"state of the union" with dana bash is up at 9:00 a.m. and again at noon with a special edition. %$* 168
but right now it's inside politics with john king. %$* 168
the wait is over. %$* 53
hillary clinton makes it official today. %$* 53
don't you some day want to see a woman president of the united states of america? %$* 149
republicans rush to offer not so warm welcomes. %$* 53
if hillary clinton is going to join with barack obama and the gun grabbers and come after our guns, then what i say is come and take it. %$* 228
and forget elizabeth warren. %$* 53
is this man a surprise threat to a clinton coronation? %$* 53
i'm lincoln chafee. %$* 261
and i'm a democrat considering a run for president of the united states. %$* 261
plus, rand paul also jumps in and rebuts republican rivals who say he's not tough enough to be commander in chief. %$* 53
i envision a national defense that promotes as reagan put it peace through strength. %$* 141
marco rubio is next as the 2016 race shifts into high %$* 53
gear. %$* 53
inside politics, the biggest stories sourced by the best reporters now. %$* 53
a big breaking news day as we welcome you this morning to inside politics. %$* 53
i'm john king. %$* 53
thanks for sharing your sunday morning. %$* 53
hillary clinton makes it official today. %$* 53
she wants to be your next president. %$* 53
national journal's ron fournier; lisa lerer of the associated press; robert costa of the "washington post"; and a familiar face on inside politics who's now the latest, great edition to our cnn political team, nia malika henderson. %$* 262
welcome to the fray. %$* 262
thank you. %$* 173
well this much was inevitable even as we rightly call it breaking news. %$* 53
hillary clinton is running for president again. %$* 53
she begins today in just a few hours, we're told. %$* 53
and she will begin the overwhelming front-runner for the democratic presidential nomination. %$* 53
it's as close to a lock as you can get. %$* 53
and if you had to bet today, she also begins because of presidential election demographics and republican party dysfunction on a few big issues. %$* 53
she begins as the early favorite to win the white house in 2016. %$* 53
and yet, ron fournier, as someone who has covered hillary clinton for more than two decades, you write in your most recent article "formidable but can be beat". %$* 53
why? %$* 53
spent the last three or four days in iowa. %$* 263
what you hear out there specifically is that they're not so sure that they want this to be a coronation. %$* 263
actually they don't want it to be. %$* 263
they want this to be a really contest. %$* 263
they have some doubts about her ability and her willingness to do the kind of retail politics that you have there. %$* 263
and they're taking a hard look at martin o'malley specifically. %$* 263
they're taking a hard look at martin o'malley, you say. %$* 53
we have some poll graphics. %$* 53
i want to put -- it's up, if we have it. %$* 53
she is 47 points ahead of her closest rival right now and that's joe biden. %$* 53
she's at 62 percent. %$* 53
joe biden is at 15 percent. %$* 53
we don't think he's running. %$* 53
elizabeth warren who says she's absolutely not running is 52 percent behind. %$* 53
then you get into the 3s and the 1s and the 1s. %$* 53
now i remember lisa rick santorum went from 2 percent to winning iowa last time so it can be done, but really? %$* 53
it can be done and i hate -- i hate to do this but i have to disagree with ron. %$* 184
why? %$* 263
i'm shocked. %$* 263
lerer:  i know. %$* 263
it's bold. %$* 263
i just don't see it. %$* 263
she controls %$* 263
the entire democratic party. %$* 263
and until martin o'malley or any of these other would-be challengers are ready to put on their big boy pants and come after her hard, i just don't see how you do it. %$* 263
unless you take down the cuba  queen in this case and you have to go after her. %$* 263
i completely agree with that. %$* 263
not just putting on your big boy pants, it's what's it about? %$* 53
what's it about. %$* 53
that's right. %$* 184
barack obama -- by this point in 2006 no one thought he could beat hillary clinton but he had arrived. %$* 53
you had john edwards in that field. %$* 53
you had  in that field. %$* 53
you had joe biden in that field. %$* 53
no offense to martin o'malley and jim webb or senator chafee, who's going to be "state of the union". %$* 53
governor chafee is going to be on "state of the union" later. %$* 53
no offense to any of them, but they don't have the experience in politics that those guys had. %$* 53
and lincoln chafee wants to say, hillary clinton voted for the iraq war, she's disqualified. %$* 53
well, that's what senator obama did and he was against the iraq war but does that have sway now with so much distance. %$* 53
no, i don't think so. %$* 173
i think most people, you look at lincoln chafee and you say who is lincoln chafee and why is he here? %$* 173
none of these guys that we talk about whether it's o'malley or webb, they don't come with any coalition. %$* 173
if you looked at barack obama, he came with sort of a coalition, african-americans, he came with young people. %$* 173
in that way he was able to run a very effective, obviously winning campaign against hillary clinton. %$* 173
none of these other people -- people don't know who they are -- that's the other thing. %$* 173
it's one thing to try to tear down hillary clinton. %$* 173
it's another to introduce yourself effectively to voters who don't know who you are. %$* 173
and they're not particularly transformational inspirational figures. %$* 184
right. %$* 53
they're not known for being these amazing politicians. %$* 184
exactly. %$* 173
but the campaign has not started. %$* 263
you guys really think there's no way -- %$* 263
i don't think there's no way. %$* 53
there's never no way. %$* 53
there's never no way. %$* 53
anybody can be beat especially in today's politics. %$* 53
just look at what's happened over the last several years. %$* 53
the surprises we've had, mostly on the republican side. %$* 53
look at obama in 2008. %$* 53
it can happen. %$* 53
the question is there's nobody anywhere close to her right now. %$* 53
the democratic party has made this investment. %$* 53
the question is she's her own biggest enemy right now. %$* 53
she's her biggest opponent right now. %$* 53
no doubt about it. %$* 178
who is she when she comes out of the gate, robert? %$* 53
and you write a great story this morning of these republicans already preparing. %$* 53
they think she's going to be the nominee. %$* 53
they think they need to spend the next two years while they're candidates or fighting amongst themselves going after her. %$* 53
are they a little bit worried that they fought the clinton wars before on the right and they lost? %$* 53
they are worried. %$* 178
and they look at secretary clinton's pre-campaign time. %$* 178
and they say that she's actually been pretty successful. %$* 178
one of the reasons senator warren is not running and you have all these lesser known rivals is because hillary clinton has moved to the left. %$* 178
she has made progressives more aware of her positions, they're more comfortable with her. %$* 178
as ron said, in iowa, they want to see her campaign, they want to see a fresh tone and a new message. %$* 178
but when it comes to her politics at least she's more in step with them than perhaps she was in the senate. %$* 178
right. %$* 53
so the question is who is she? %$* 53
i remember her. %$* 53
you remember her when she was first lady of arkansas, then she was first lady of the country, then she was senator, then she was presidential candidate, then she was secretary of state. %$* 53
nobody in my lifetime doing this has reinvented themselves or reintroduced themselves so many times in so many different ways. %$* 53
so we'll see how she does. %$* 53
she writes an epilogue. %$* 53
her book is out in paperback now. %$* 53
she writes an epilogue that is teasing where she wants to go in this campaign. %$* 53
she says "i'm more convinced than ever that our future in the 21st century depends on our ability to ensure that a child born in the hills of the appalachia or the mississippi delta or the rio grande valley grows up with the same shot at success that charlotte will." %$* 53
charlotte being, of course, her granddaughter. %$* 53
she's not saying the clintons are dead broke anymore if you notice in that. %$* 53
but she is saying and she did some of this when she was in arkansas with mixed success working in the mississippi delta on education and on hunger issues. %$* 53
this is a more populist hillary clinton. %$* 53
can she sell that? %$* 53
but the problem is you can't sell what you aren't. %$* 263
she has to figure out who she is and make sure she sells that. %$* 263
i get worried when i read these kinds of stories that we've seen today where they're talking about how they poll-tested barack obama and how you separate yourself. %$* 263
who is she? %$* 263
who are you? %$* 53
right. %$* 53
fournier:  and what are you going to do? %$* 53
what are you going to %$* 53
do to make our country better? %$* 53
that's what she's got to be able to show. %$* 53
if she can do that in an authentic way and not be what she thinks joe benson wants her to be. %$* 53
she has to thread the needle between being the fighting grandma, which i think is how she's going to come out. %$* 184
that's certainly what she laid on the epilogue. %$* 184
who's going to fight for these populist economic causes and also being someone who can bring washington back together. %$* 184
i think in the general electorate there's a real desire to see washington actually work. %$* 184
we don't know if that's possible. %$* 184
but she wants to cast herself as someone who can do that. %$* 184
and that is a more natural fit for her. %$* 184
"it's my turn" is not a compelling presidential message. %$* 53
right. %$* 173
no. %$* 184
no. %$* 173
and the republicans, no doubt -- and we'll talk more about this later -- will make generational argument. %$* 53
she will be 69 on election day. %$* 53
that's right. %$* 173
ronald reagan was our oldest president elected. %$* 53
he was 69 on election day and the republicans are going to make the argument that -- nice woman, great career in public service -- you're yesterday. %$* 53
we're talking about tomorrow. %$* 53
yes, i don't know that they'll make that argument, "nice woman". %$* 173
you don't think -- ok let's skip the "nice woman". %$* 53
yes. %$* 173
and i think what democrats are going to try to do is say, listen, she's got this experience. %$* 173
it might mean that she's older, she's 69. %$* 173
but it also means that she knows the ways of washington, that she knows leaders from her experience as secretary of state. %$* 173
i think her challenge is going to be, how does she make people excited? %$* 173
that's something barack obama was able to do. %$* 173
there's one thing to be populist but can she also be aspirational? %$* 173
i think that's a real challenge for her because people are kind of bored. %$* 173
as a person -- not just -- look, she'll have history on her side. %$* 53
she will say i will be the first woman president. %$* 53
if you look at the demographics in the country, that's powerful. %$* 53
that's a nice weapon to have, you think. %$* 53
i think it has to be personal for her. %$* 53
one more quick point -- robby mook, who will be her campaign %$* 53
manager and one key point; she has assembled a very different staff this time -- a lot of veterans of the obama , a lot of younger people, more high tech people, people, including her chairman john podesta, who aren't afraid to walk in the room and say "no" to hillary clinton. %$* 53
that's important as we watch this play out. %$* 53
but she's the candidate. %$* 53
she's going to have to set the tone and go through the pits. %$* 53
but robby mook says in a statement the campaign distributed and they wanted us to have. %$* 53
"this campaign is not about hillary clinton and not about us." %$* 53
of course it is. %$* 53
of course it is. %$* 53
"we are humble. %$* 53
we take nothing for granted. %$* 53
we are never afraid to lose." %$* 53
yes, you are. %$* 53
"we always out compete and fight for every vote we can win. %$* 53
we know this campaign will be won on the ground, in the states". %$* 53
that fact's true. %$* 53
i found that fascinating. %$* 263
to get ready for today, i read one of my favorite writers this morning -- me. %$* 263
in 2013 i wrote a memo to hillary basically based on reporting by people very close to her who really like her, really think that she needs to get her authentic self out there. %$* 263
they wrote through me in this memo to her that she needs to be accessible. %$* 263
she needs to be vulnerable. %$* 263
she needs to have a small and scrappy campaign. %$* 263
she needs to show that she's nimble and humble and honest and authentic, and above all fearless. %$* 263
something she's never been is fearless. %$* 263
so this memo is, she had only that kind of thinking. %$* 263
she's obviously got people around here who respect her, think she'd be a great president, think she's a decent person and want her to show that side of her for the first time. %$* 263
and we get back to your point, can she be that person? %$* 263
can she finally be fearless? %$* 263
can she be transparent? %$* 263
look at what she did with the -- that's why the e-mail thing is such a bad deal. %$* 263
because it's so counter to what she's promised -- what she needs to be to be a -- %$* 263
when you surround yourself in presidential politics says so much about what you're going to do in your campaign -- %$* 178
yes. %$* 263
-- i think the hiring of robby mook -- someone who's in his 30s, who's run grassroots campaigns. %$* 178
i agree and we'll talk about this later. %$* 264
her team in %$* 264
iowa is a reflection of robby mook but can she go out there and do the real retail politics, be authentic -- %$* 264
you can have the best staff in the business it's still about the candidate. %$* 53
and to the point you made about the e-mails i don't want to -- we're going to move on but i don't want to do so without saying this. %$* 53
she still has some explaining to do on that one, to the congress. %$* 53
i personally think it's inexcusable for somebody who is the keeper of government records, if you made the decision to keep those records on a private server in your home, you don't get to be the only person who decides this is the government's property, this is my property. %$* 53
you needed somebody with a clean set of eyes -- independents to do that. %$* 53
hear, hear. %$* 263
she didn't. %$* 53
here we go. %$* 53
we'll see what happens moving forward. %$* 53
a lot of iowa democrats agree with you. %$* 263
a lot of iowa democrats -- and this will be part of the campaign not just with the republicans and the testimony at the congress. %$* 53
we'll see. %$* 53
a lot more to talk on hillary's big day. %$* 53
up next thought, rand paul's temper becomes an issue in his first week as a presidential contender. %$* 53
and marco rubio, next out of the gop gate. %$* 53
welcome back. %$* 53
for six plus years now republicans have made the case that freshman senator barack obama just wasn't ready to be president. %$* 53
and yet the first three official entries into what will be a crowded gop field are -- you guessed it -- freshmen senators. %$* 53
ted cruz two weeks ago, rand paul this past week and marco rubio jumps in tomorrow night. %$* 53
cruz had a big first week, a jump in the polls and a huge fund- raising. %$* 53
rand paul entered the race with a stronger foundation but week one was a bit rocky; questions about his temper because, yes, he gets testy in interviews when you suggest he's changed his positions, like on iran. %$* 53
you look at the evidence that iran is not a threat, iran cannot even refine their own gasoline. %$* 141
there has always been a threat of iran gaining nuclear weapons. %$* 141
or on say, cutting off aid to israel. %$* 53
just to be precise, end all foreign aid, including the foreign aid to israel as well, is that right? %$* 142
yes. %$* 141
that has not been a position -- a legislative position. %$* 141
we have never introduced anything to phase out or get rid of israel's aid. %$* 141
or on how to treat workers, say, who entered the united states illegally. %$* 53
what becomes of the 12 million undocumented workers in the united states? %$* 141
my plan is very simple. %$* 141
it will include work visas for those who are here and are willing to come forward and work. %$* 141
i do not support amnesty. %$* 141
millions of illegal immigrants are crossing our border without our knowledge and causing a clear threat to our national security. %$* 141
he got testy a few times, robert, with people saying that he's been inconsistent. %$* 53
that's not the biggest issue. %$* 53
whether you can sell that to reporters or they can fight with reporters. %$* 53
but when you're out there reporting in iowa and new hampshire, places even he conceded this week he has to win early somewhere. %$* 53
rand paul to prove he's not ron paul, to prove he's a potential a nominee not just an impact player in the race has to win somewhere. %$* 53
do conservatives see him as pure, as one of theirs, or does he have issues? %$* 53
well, his father's supporters, those ron paul libertarians, they're skeptical about senator paul right now. %$* 178
they're wondering. %$* 178
is he running as a movement candidate? %$* 178
does he have a real platform he wants to pursue or is it about confining a new centrist moderate coalition, conservative coalition to get the nomination? %$* 178
people aren't really sure about where he's going. %$* 178
and if he doesn't have that hard base of 20 percent that his father had in iowa and new hampshire, it's going to be a struggle for him in a crowded field. %$* 178
you're going to see him on "state of the union" after this program. %$* 53
please stay. %$* 53
rand paul among the interviews -- dana bash hosting the program. %$* 53
she asked rand paul because of the questions was more of these testy confrontations seem to come with female reporters so she asked him, do you have a problem? %$* 53
perception is reality sometimes in politics. %$* 32
so if you are the republican nominee and you're on the stage with hillary clinton, a female opponent, you're going to have to pull your punches given the perception of you now? %$* 32
i think women have come a long way. %$* 141
women are in positions not because they're women. %$* 141
they're in positions like yours because they're intelligent and they should be equal to their counterparts and treated equally. %$* 141
but i can tell you that the interviewers in the last couple of days probably got it easier than what i gave to eliot spitzer on your program here probably about a year or so ago because the thing is that i'm unwilling to let people characterize things unfairly. %$* 141
and if someone's going to write an op-ed on me in the question, that's fair for them to try to do it, but it's also fair for me to try to set the record straight that they're editorializing the question. %$* 141
and you've got a frown on your face. %$* 53
please. %$* 53
well, you know, the problem here is that rand paul has changed his mind. %$* 173
why doesn't he have a real answer to this? %$* 173
he can talk all he wants to about savannah guthrie and being a hostile interview. %$* 173
we all know savannah guthrie. %$* 173
she was not being a hostile interviewer in that instance. %$* 173
it seems like every time this comes up in interviews this is what sets him off. %$* 173
he sort of says, are you going to believe me or are you going believe your lying ears? %$* 173
or are you going to believe your videotape? %$* 53
yes. %$* 173
or your videos -- exactly. %$* 173
you know his team wants to basically run a general election strategy. %$* 184
they were hoping hillary clinton's announcement would come at the same time as their announcement so they can run this campaign like a general election campaign. %$* 184
so they're trying to reach out to people who don't necessarily know rand paul in a very un- charming way. %$* 184
i mean he comes off as a rand spleener . %$* 184
let me explain what i mean. %$* 263
to casual political viewers, it's not really how you want to introduce yourself. %$* 184
and that's why it matters. %$* 263
in this instance he is both delusional and vulnerable. %$* 263
he's delusional if he thinks he really hasn't flip-flopped. %$* 263
he's vulnerable if he doesn't realize what the impact of that is. %$* 263
mixing up with reporters, that actually is going to help him %$* 263
with the republican base. %$* 263
that's not a problem, but when he has a woman from , a 65-year-old woman in  asking why he's flip flopped on immigration. %$* 263
why he's flip-flopped on iran and he responds half as temperamentally as he did to that woman he's going to kill them in iowa. %$* 263
if he responds like that on the debate stage, he's going to find himself in trouble. %$* 263
he's got to figure out how to control his temper. %$* 263
and yet don't count him out because if you look at the numbers from last time rick santorum won iowa 24.6 percent of the vote, 34 votes ahead of mitt romney. %$* 53
ron paul right behind that. %$* 53
so if he keeps what he has right now, rand paul will be an impact player in iowa. %$* 53
the question is can he grow enough to win and can he grow to be a nominee? %$* 53
i want to get to this quickly. %$* 53
marco rubio announces tomorrow night. %$* 53
this is the one i'm most fascinated with at the moment because of his growth potential. %$* 53
he has a lot of problems, marco rubio does, including the fact that his former governor jeb bush had raised more money early on. %$* 53
but marco rubio in my view, let's talk about it real quickly, we don't have a lot of time, gets the american dream thing better than the other candidates. %$* 53
as an inspirational family story, you're going to hear a lot of things like this. %$* 53
i know that every chance i have ever had and everything that i will ever accomplish i owe to god, to my parents' sacrifices and to the united states of america. %$* 195
if he can grow inspirational, generational could draw a contrast with hillary clinton and i think a lot of republicans think might be good. %$* 53
he's the best political athlete in the field. %$* 263
if he can grow. %$* 53
not only do voters like that kind of message. %$* 184
donors, self-made donors like it, too. %$* 184
jeb bush remains a key threat for him. %$* 178
can he get the money from florida? %$* 178
can he build a national fundraising base? %$* 178
can he sell the fact that he's only been in the senate for a few years. %$* 173
he's kind of has the obama problem. %$* 173
he's going to remind you he was the florida speaker of the house before. %$* 53
over and over again -- yes. %$* 173
king:  everybody stay tight. %$* 173
up next our reporters empty their %$* 173
notebooks, give you a glimpse at tomorrow's news today including a sneak peak of how chris christie plans to prove his 2016 critics dead wrong. %$* 173
let's head around the inside politics table so our great reporters can share something from their notebooks, get you out ahead of the big political news to come. %$* 53
nia malika henderson. %$* 53
marco rubio tomorrow will become the second latino in the republican primary field. %$* 173
jeb bush when he announces might become the third one. %$* 173
he's been called an honorary latino, not only by his son but many folks i talked to in florida. %$* 173
they think he's going to give marco rubio a big run in terms of getting the latino vote. %$* 173
he got 60 percent of the latino vote when he ran in florida. %$* 173
obviously speaks spanish, has a very moderate record on immigration reform. %$* 173
a couple of states to look for -- nevada, colorado as well as florida in terms of splitting that latino vote -- it's going to be an interesting thing to watch. %$* 173
we'd love to watch that one as we go forward. %$* 53
robert? %$* 53
in baseball spring training just ended but in new jersey another politician has been getting ready for the new political season. %$* 178
that's chris christie. %$* 178
he's been having town hall meetings in the garden state. %$* 178
this week he's gone to new hampshire. %$* 178
he believes he can mount a political comeback by returning to his strength -- talking to voters, engaging in a forum, having his personalities show. %$* 178
we'll see what happens, it's a crowded field. %$* 178
but he believes the force of his personality can be his weigh back. %$* 178
he's been missing for a while. %$* 53
it will be fun to watch chris christie. %$* 53
thank you, robert. %$* 53
lisa. %$* 53
one of the biggest questions about the nascent hillary clinton campaign is not so much about the candidate. %$* 184
it's about her husband. %$* 184
last week president bill clinton told -- said in an interview he'd be taking a backstage role on the campaign. %$* 184
his schedule has offered other clues. %$* 184
on tuesday two days after his wife announces he'll be in new york giving an award on global health. %$* 184
at end of the month he's headed for africa for a meeting of his foundation. %$* 184
the clinton campaign has strategized that it's better despite the former president's considerable political assets -- he's the most popular politician in the country, it's better to let his wife take the spotlight and define herself. %$* 184
that may not be as easy as they think it is. %$* 184
we all know after several decades in the political spotlight, nobody puts bill clinton in the corner. %$* 184
well put. %$* 263
they really do have some experience in trying to do that. %$* 53
i spent the last four days in iowa. %$* 263
i was really struck by the fact that if you ask any democratic official in iowa, they want a contest, not a coronation. %$* 263
and they're going to get a contest. %$* 263
it's very clear that martin o'malley most likely but somebody is going to give her at least a run for their money because that's what they want out there. %$* 263
what really surprised me though is how the clinton team gets this. %$* 263
it's a really smart team she's got on the ground there. %$* 263
they really know iowa. %$* 263
they really respect iowa. %$* 263
the leader of it, matt paul, is from iowa. %$* 263
in addition to everything that you've heard about what she's going to do about a small campaign and being their intimate, they've also decided that they're going to use her celebrity in iowa to raise up the visibility of iowa -- rising young iowa politicians. %$* 263
and to focus on some local issues that normally a presidential candidate wants that are important to democrats to show that she thinks that her campaign is bigger than just her. %$* 263
we'll see if she can pass that test, shall we say? %$* 53
iowa to hillary clinton is more than a four letter word. %$* 53
exactly. %$* 263
i'll close to this. %$* 53
today is hillary clinton's day, monday is marco rubio's but ted cruz is looking to steal a little bit of their thunder. %$* 53
after opening his campaign with appeals to tea party conservatives and then evangelicals, the texas senator now looking to start a conversation with national security conservatives. %$* 53
he's going to be in north carolina on monday speaking to the conservative john lock foundation. %$* 53
and a central focus of his speech will be making the case that the world grew a lot more dangerous when hillary clinton was secretary of state. %$* 53
now cruz as you might know causes a lot of grumbling among his senate colleagues including republicans sometimes especially republicans for ignoring long-established protocol and repeatedly defying the party leadership. %$* 53
but his team insists the monday speech is not meant to be rude to rubio. %$* 53
they say it was on the books well before the senator scheduled his announcement. %$* 53
and they say it will be over several hours before senator rubio's big event. %$* 53
we'll see if any bad blood comes of that. %$* 53
that's it for inside politics. %$* 53
thanks again for sharing your sunday morning. %$* 53
stay with cnn throughout the day for our breaking news coverage of hillary clinton's big presidential campaign announcing including on "state of the union" which starts right now. %$* 53

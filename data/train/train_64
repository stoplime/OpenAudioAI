jake tapper is in for john king for inside politics. %$* 168
that starts right now. %$* 168
hillary clinton readies her rollout with a friendly lunch and a series of strategic leaks. %$* 159
choices is at the core of what kind of people we want to be and what kind of countries we want to have. %$* 149
also the political fallout from the veterans affairs scandal. %$* 159
secretary shinseki offered me his own resignation with considerable regret i accepted. %$* 40
former general eric shinseki maybe gone, but will the failures of the va system continue to haunt democrats in the midterms. %$* 159
plus the big primary week ahead will contests in eight states be the tea party's last hope? %$* 159
inside politics the biggest stories sourced by the best reporters now. %$* 159
i'm jake tapper in for john king. %$* 159
thanks for sharing your sunday morning with us. %$* 159
molly ball of the "atlantic", "politico's" manu raju, npr's steve inskeep and margaret talev from bloomberg news. %$* 177
hillary clinton's new book comes out in ten days. %$* 177
perhaps you've heard about it. %$* 177
but we've already been treated to a strategic buildup worthy of, dare we say it, a presidential campaign. %$* 177
first came the mother's day excerpt in "vogue" magazine about her own mother. %$* 177
and then last week an audio recording of the candidate -- i'm sorry -- of the former secretary reading her author's note. %$* 177
everything that i have done and seen has convinced me that america remains the indispensable nation. %$* 149
next, came a facebook video. %$* 159
now we can see her as well as hear her. %$* 159
then a surprise launch with an admirer. %$* 159
no, not this one -- someone else, at his place. %$* 159
i always admired her. %$* 40
as soon as she got here, she couldn't have been more effective, more loyal. %$* 40
and -- and since that time we've become really, really good friends. %$* 40
finally on friday in the shadow of a big competing story about eric shinseki's resignation as secretary of veterans affairs, the book's chapter on benghazi leaks. %$* 159
quote, "i will not be a part of a political slug fest on the backs of dead americans. %$* 159
it's just plain wrong and it's unworthy of our great country. %$* 159
those who insist on politicizing the tragedy will have to do so without me." %$* 159
molly, is that going to work? %$* 159
well yes and no. %$* 155
i mean i think the other crucial thing that she says in this excerpt that was leaked is that there are not unanswered questions. %$* 155
there are answers nobody is listening to. %$* 155
and we learned this week, also, that she's agreed to and a lengthy interview on fox news. %$* 155
i think she wants to show that she can take anything they can throw at her. %$* 155
and that she is answering the questions and that's how she'll make the case that this is all just a political thing and not an attack that has substance. %$* 155
will that work? %$* 155
i don't know. %$* 155
yes. %$* 146
just to take it back to the whole campaign going on here for want of a better word, this has been very carefully calibrated, everything dropped in drift. %$* 159
and though we certainly don't know where your colleague, maggie haberman got this chapter from, it's strategically placed on a friday when there's also competing big news. %$* 159
that's right. %$* 146
and plus, she will eventually have to go on all the networks, talk about what happened, she's going to be asked about benghazi. %$* 146
get her side of the story out there first before she's asked on the news, asked by reporters what happened. %$* 146
this is a clear pr effort by her to try to stay -- you know punch back and say that republicans have been bashing her for the past several weeks. %$* 146
she's probably going to have to come before the select committee that's in the house right now that's investigating this matter, get her story outside, get her story out first before they start asking her questions, both in the press and on the hill. %$* 146
she says she's not going to be part of a political slugfest. %$* 154
obviously she is. %$* 154
and this is her slug this is her throwing a punch. %$* 154
right. %$* 159
this is what she's doing. %$* 154
in the end though you do have to ask the question, what is there that's going to stick to hillary clinton a couple of years from now? %$* 154
and that's the time frame that we're talking about here. %$* 154
i was thinking about george bush's famous 16 words. %$* 154
there were 16 words in a speech that people were able to identify that they felt was a lie, leading up to the iraq war. %$* 154
and you can argue about that and argue about that endlessly. %$* 154
i'm not sure that there are 16 equivalent words for hillary clinton in this scandal. %$* 154
there are quotes that are damaging, but is there something that she did that people can capture the public's imagine with two years from now in the facts? %$* 154
i don't know. %$* 154
and -- %$* 159
this is ultimately hillary trying to set the narrative and the pace for her own story. %$* 171
we've seen karl rove come out of the gate a couple times in the last few weeks, old and scary or did you fall down and can you think for yourself on their own. %$* 171
and this is her saying i'm not going to talk about it unless i want to talk about it. %$* 171
if i don't want to talk about it here's why i'm not going to talk about it. %$* 171
and by the way, why have lunch with president obama this time? %$* 171
i'm going to control the pictures that get tweeted, not the white house. %$* 171
and you know it's also interesting about -- about that lunch is that what then president obama did this interview with kelly and michael and just totally lavished her with praise. %$* 159
he had nice things to say about the vice president too but it was a real -- %$* 159
and he's been laying the groundwork for quite some time. %$* 171
you remember at the correspondents dinner you know a month ago he was already putting joe biden off to the side and anointing her as his successor. %$* 171
and this is -- there's nothing accidental about any of this. %$* 171
this is completely strategic and thought out. %$* 171
there was a delightful article in one of publications in politico magazine, it was a profile of vice president biden and some of the almost poignant details where vice president biden wanting to make little exploratory views towards a potential campaign and the white house reeling him in, reeling him in and saying no you work for one man at a time. %$* 154
and that's been the frustrating thing for joe biden who really wants to be seen as the most qualified person in the field right now. %$* 146
i mean it's interesting you see all of his senate colleagues. %$* 146
he was a senator for you know three decades. %$* 146
he had that numerous friendships on the hill. %$* 146
but those senate democrats are all lining up behind hillary right now. %$* 146
and part of -- and so is the white house, so is the president it seems. %$* 146
before we get to 2016, of course we have to get to 2014, the midterm elections. %$* 159
and a couple weeks ago i had lunch with a top democrat who told me that eric shinseki could not still be in the administration by november. %$* 159
if he was, it would cost democrats the senate. %$* 159
he's obviously gone now. %$* 159
how much do you think there will be a lingering effect of the va scandal? %$* 159
obviously there are two components here, the actual problem with getting care to veterans and then the political ramifications of this. %$* 159
we all can agree on the getting the care to veterans part of it. %$* 159
but where are the politics going, do you think? %$* 159
well i mean it's clear the republicans believe there is political mileage that gotten out of this or they wouldn't be airing ads on it and you do have the crossroads committees and i think other republican candidates airing ads on the scandal, tying vulnerable democrats to the president, to the scandal, and you know all the political science on this is clear, that when the president looks bad, candidates from his party do worse. %$* 155
and so to the extent that this lingers or it reinforces a pre- existing idea about obama that he -- that he is ineffective or that he is weak or that he is not running a competent administration, that is the perception that republicans are going to continue to hammer and i think that's why you had john boehner say on friday that the president is not off the hook for this no matter what has happened to his cabinet. %$* 155
in fact we have the sound bite. %$* 159
i want to play it, speaker boehner who never called for shinseki to resign. %$* 159
and on friday he say seemed to be blaming president obama and not shinseki. %$* 159
general shinseki has dedicated his life to our country and we thank him for his service. %$* 243
his resignation, though, does not absolve the president of his responsibility to step in and make things right for our veterans. %$* 243
and business as usual cannot continue. %$* 243
putting this right on the doorstep of president obama. %$* 159
that's right. %$* 146
and what's interesting is that democrats actually are ready to have an argument over veterans health care. %$* 146
now that the accountability issue is sort of taken off the table that shinseki has stepped aside, they feel like if there's an argument right now about providing health care to veterans. %$* 146
they have a better argument funding va medical centers. %$* 146
that's something that republicans are not necessarily for. %$* 146
they want to see this going into the private sector where having veterans have access to private medical care. %$* 146
that's the debate they hope happens. %$* 146
but the issue is that there may be other issues to drop in this. %$* 146
and democrats are not clear, are not united over whether there should be legislation in order to allow for more va senior officials to be fired and demoted. %$* 146
stay with us. %$* 159
up next, what may be the tea party's last stand and a u.s. senate race defined by tweets and bloggers. %$* 159
and for this week edition of "politicians say the dandiest things." %$* 159
we give you sarah palin and the patriarch of "duck dynasty." %$* 159
need we say more? %$* 159
maybe the fellow that you're going to hear from, our main speaker tonight, maybe he should be not just the duck commander, how about a duck commander-in-chief. %$* 224
speaking of sharp dressed man, i'm serious when i'm telling you i have on the very best clothes i own. %$* 21
eight states hold primaries this coming tuesday. %$* 159
the pieces for this week's political puzzle are tweets from a contest that is deep in the mississippi mud. %$* 159
it's a race tailor-made for the tea party featuring a series of tweets aimed at long time republican senator thad cochran. %$* 568
he's been in the senate a long time. %$* 568
how long you ask? %$* 568
just follow the tweets launched by supporters of tea party challenger chris mcdaniel. %$* 568
more on him in a moment. %$* 568
but back to senator cochran, the tea party calls him a big spender -- heresy. %$* 568
he's well-traveled. %$* 568
could that mean he's out of touch with the folk back home? %$* 568
all of this is just run-of-the-mill dirty politics. %$* 568
but here is where it gets interesting, a conservative blogger is arrested, goes to jail for breaking into a nursing home to photograph senator cochran's wife who is suffering from dementia. %$* 568
cochran supporters argue, the reason the blogger took the pictures was to feed questions about cochran and long-time aide kay weber who has traveled extensively with the senator on the taxpayer dime. %$* 568
cochran's campaign calls it part of her job and suggests the blogger was put up to his alleged dirty deeds by none other than tea party opponent chris mcdaniel. %$* 568
well, was he? %$* 568
unidentified male:  our campaign had absolutely no connection with that whatsoever. %$* 303
you personally, when did you find out about the break-in? %$* 32
look, we're going to focus on his record right now. %$* 303
i'm sure they will. %$* 159
so manu, what do you make of all this? %$* 159
i think cochran probably is going to narrowly escape. %$* 146
but it's going to be close. %$* 146
they've really effectively used this against chris mcdaniel. %$* 146
as you saw for that interview, it was hard for him to explain what happened with that arrest. %$* 146
overall, i mean this is another example of tea party forces having a tough time knocking down the establishment this cycle. %$* 146
they have forced these guys to run to the right and adopt a lot of their positions on the right. %$* 146
they're having a hard time with easily the most vulnerable candidate right now, thad cochran, a guy who's not prepared for his re-election, really didn't do a who lot and started running late. %$* 146
it seems like he's going to win. %$* 146
if he does, it will be because of that incident. %$* 146
and what's interesting steve is in many ways you could argue the tea party has already won. %$* 159
even if candidates like mcdaniel don't win, they have so succeeded in shifting their party to the right. %$* 159
well, the thing about that -- they certainly have shifted the party to the right. %$* 154
it's interesting thought that the tea party groups that you talk to have to say what you said, our candidates are losing but we're forcing our ideas on the other side. %$* 154
part of that equation is their candidates are losing. %$* 154
and you do have to ask, if lawmakers once elected or re-elected like thad cochran -- if he is re-elected -- are going to be quite as fearful of the tea party because their power was threatening people with the primary challenge. %$* 154
if that threat is broken this year, i think that might make a difference at least on the margins. %$* 154
i mean the republican party is conservative. %$* 154
people are going to vote in a conservative way but there may be a little bit more room for people to make compromises when they feel it's necessary. %$* 154
margaret, the establishment really was prepared this time, the republican establishment, and in a way they weren't last time. %$* 159
that's right. %$* 171
well part of this is that in this specific case, this is just such a deeply personal issue between cochran and his family and it's not really right for picking off. %$* 171
but more broadly when you look at 2010 and then 2012 elections, everyone caught the tea party by surprise. %$* 171
nobody was sure what to do, we saw obama get re-elected. %$* 171
and what you see now really is a movement towards 2016. %$* 171
you see boehner and mcconnell both saying, look, enough is enough. %$* 171
we need to figure out how to wrap this up and move on. %$* 171
you see a lot of republican business people and sort of establishment leaders saying we need to figure out how to position ourselves for 2016. %$* 171
we also have the iowa senate race. %$* 159
there you have a candidate joni ernst who has managed to get both the establishment and the tea party on board. %$* 159
and those are the candidates that are strong not just in the primary but potentially for the general election. %$* 159
yes, i think the real news of 2014 is the rise of these sort of fusion candidates. %$* 155
joni ernst endorsed by both sarah palin and mitt romney. %$* 155
that tells you all you need to know about the kind of backing she's managed to assemble. %$* 155
someone like ben sachs in nebraska, someone like tom tillis in north carolina, even though he had a nominally tea party opponent or a couple of opponents, clearly had the support of a lot of conservatives. %$* 155
think we might see that in georgia if jack kingston makes it out of the runoff as well. %$* 155
you do see a party that is increasingly consolidated under a conservative banner, but also a party where the establishment has really managed to bring some of these more unruly forces into the tent in the name of party unity, in the name of trying to win a national election again because that's what they're going to need. %$* 155
and part of that is also, you know, spending money in primaries. %$* 146
you know, the tea party forces have been effective in past election cycles because a lot of the establishment types weren't spending money. %$* 146
the chamber of commerce wasn't going in and propping up their candidates the way they did in idaho with mike simpson, the way they did with jack kingston in georgia. %$* 146
this time they are spending money to bring -- to prop up the people that they think are the most electable and going after those outside groups on the right who do spend a lot of money like the club for growth and senate conservatives fund in a very aggressive way. %$* 146
that's been the big shift this election cycle and it's worked effectively but we'll see if it pays dividends in november. %$* 146
next, tomorrow's news today. %$* 159
our reporters preview the big political stories that are just around the corner. %$* 159
lots of goings and comings in the obama administration. %$* 159
of note, especially for the washington press corps, friday's announcement that white house press secretary jay carney is moving on. %$* 159
in midlife you don't often make a whole new set of friends, not just friends but people you would fight by and for under any circumstance. %$* 535
that's certainly what i have been lucky enough to get over these past five and a half years. %$* 535
so it's been a privilege and it continues to be a privilege. %$* 535
every day in here with you has been a privilege. %$* 535
people -- %$* 535
every day? %$* 21
-- more often than not say to me you have the hardest job or you have one of the hardest jobs. %$* 535
i'm not saying it's easy every day, but i love it. %$* 535
it's an important interaction that takes place here. %$* 535
it's not always pretty. %$* 535
it could certainly be better, but it's -- to be a part of it is an honor and a joy for me. %$* 535
and no matter how tough the briefing is, i walk out of here having been glad to stand here. %$* 535
every sunday we ask our great reporters to share something from their notebooks. %$* 159
but first i want a few words to describe the departing white house press secretary jay carney who just on friday announced that he was leaving. %$* 159
yes. %$* 146
i think it's not a total surprise because it is a grueling, thankless job that no one really wants to stay in for longer than several years. %$* 146
he's probably ready to move on. %$* 146
he said in his departure statement that it was a very fulfilling job. %$* 154
i can't believe anyone would admit that it's fulfilling to deal with the media but i'm impressed he was able to say it with a straight face. %$* 154
why on friday? %$* 159
margaret -- why announce it that day? %$* 159
look, this may have been long planned and maybe it was always going to be a friday. %$* 171
but the advantage again of dumping it on a friday, on a really busy friday with a lot of other stuff going on is that he will not get the same amount of coverage for not replacing jay with a woman. %$* 171
a lot of speculation on whether this would be finally female press secretary under obama -- it will not be. %$* 171
it will be a continuation of status quo, a trusted loyal member, but not a woman. %$* 171
this makes that not something that will get as much attention. %$* 171
another white man as the press secretary. %$* 159
people thought jen psaki at the state department might get it. %$* 159
she had been mentioned among others and -- %$* 171
president obama likes his bros -- he likes his bros. molly. %$* 159
he does like his bros and carney's successor, josh ernest -- what a terrific name there -- he's pretty well liked by the white house press corps. %$* 155
here's how far back i go with josh ernest. %$* 155
i covered him when he was -- before he was with obama in iowa, as obama mentioned, he was actually with the short-lived presidential campaign of tom vilsack. %$* 155
tapper:  tom vilsack. %$* 155
of course, one of obama's top aides, dan pfeiffer with the short-lived presidential campaign of evan bayh. %$* 155
i had to reach -- %$* 155
deep cut jake. %$* 155
deep cut. %$* 155
i had to reach into the recesses. %$* 159
let's go into the -- let's go into the other notebooks we have -- the reporters' notebooks -- margaret. %$* 159
next week the theme for president obama will be all about putin. %$* 171
we'll see him in poland, in brussels and in france, of course. %$* 171
but every stop is really tailored to sort of tweak this relationship with russia, show president putin about how strong u.s. alliances are with nato allies, with the g-7 and then in normandy to show here is what the u.s. and russia could do when they were on the same side together. %$* 171
so look for that to be the theme %$* 171
this past week was about veterans affairs. %$* 154
we've been doing some reporting on another agency, customs and border protection, the border patrol -- the guys guarding u.s.-mexico border and other borders. %$* 154
there have been a lot of questions about the border patrol shooting unarmed people, including mexicans. %$* 154
there have been a lot of questions about americans being searched by the border patrol and a lot of questions in that agency about transparency. %$* 154
some of the same kinds of questions being asked about the va -- who knows what's going on. %$* 154
? %$* 154
it's described as a very secretive agency. %$* 154
the president has appointed new homeland security leadership. %$* 154
they have promised more transparency. %$* 154
they gave a tiny bit on friday but there's a lot of questions left to answer and we're looking into that. %$* 154
you've done some great reporting from the border for npr. %$* 159
it's fashionable, jake, on the campaign trail for republican candidates to say i'm not going to support mitch mcconnell as leader or i don't know if i'll support him because maybe he won't run. %$* 146
but mcconnell has been methodically going behind the scenes to lock down support from people who don't necessarily support him who has made those comments on the campaign trail. %$* 146
one example -- ben sasse; he had a pretty cool relationship with mitch mcconnell because of sasse's support in nebraska from the senate conservatives fund. %$* 146
but after sasse won his primary, he was on the phone with mitch mcconnell. %$* 146
he cut a check to mitch mcconnell and he had lunch with senate republicans right before they left for their recess -- another example of how he's locking down support and will have the support to become majority leader if he wins his re-election and republicans take the majority. %$* 146
molly. %$* 159
well, for all this talk about how the tea party is dying out is not getting a lot of scalps in the senate primaries this year, the tea party is alive and well and living in texas, it turns out. %$* 155
in the texas run-off that happened this past week, the conservative candidate won by a wide margin for lieutenant governor taking out poor old david dewhurst -- the same guy who lost to ted cruz last time around, the attorney general race, the agriculture commissioner race all won by quite far-right candidates to the point where some texas republicans are even worrying that the demographics supposed inevitability -- the democrats are always talking about turning texas blue may be coming faster than they thought because these are candidates who are so conservative particularly on issues like immigration. %$* 155
interesting. %$* 159
it might actually hasten the democrats. %$* 159
yes, dan patrick, the lieutenant governor candidate has called it an invasion of illegals going. %$* 155
and you know, there's a long history of republicans in texas like rick perry, like george w. bush calling for a more liberal position on immigration. %$* 155
that's not what these candidates are talking about. %$* 155
very interesting. %$* 159
and in my notebook, i talked to many national security experts this week and they shared the same concern. %$* 159
syria -- its civil war attracting jihadists from every nation. %$* 159
the experts is spoke to worry that the next terrorist attack on american interests either at home or abroad will come from someone involved in syria's instability, specifically many mentioned the group isis. %$* 159
we will keep our eye on that concern. %$* 159
that's it for inside politics. %$* 159
thanks again for sharing your sunday morning. %$* 159
john king will be back here in the anchor chair next sunday. %$* 159
"state of the union" with candy crowley starts right now. %$* 159

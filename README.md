Recreating the LSTM-RNN from https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07713

Plan:
- [ ] Get explicite segmentation result from unmodified code
- [ ] Augment the data for our own purposes
- [ ] Setup a CNN version with hierarchical attention
- [ ] Find or design a model for speaker comparison
- [ ] Parse the given data for speaker comparison training
- [ ] Implement a model that builds off of the speaker segmentation and use it to train the speaker comparison
